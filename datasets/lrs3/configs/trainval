trainval/00j9bKdiOjk/50001 ONE DAY A YOUNG BOY COMES UPON THE SUNFLOWER WHILE VISITING THE GARDEN AND HE NOTICES HOW WEAK IT LOOKS
trainval/00j9bKdiOjk/50002 JUST LIKE REACHING OUT TO THE SUNFLOWER BY PROVIDING SOMEONE WHO IS NEGLECTED ISOLATED OR FORGOTTEN
trainval/00j9bKdiOjk/50003 THEY ARE INCREDIBLE YET SO OFTEN THEY ARE FORGOTTEN LACKING THE LOVE AND APPRECIATION THEY DESERVE
trainval/01GWGmg5jn8/50001 I WILL HAVE HOPEFULLY MET MY GOAL
trainval/01GWGmg5jn8/50002 THAT WAS COMPLETELY WRONG
trainval/01GWGmg5jn8/50003 AS IT HAPPENED BECAUSE OF THAT CONVENIENCE BECAUSE OF THAT ACCESS I ACTUALLY CHANGED MY BEHAVIOUR AND I STARTED DOING
trainval/01GWGmg5jn8/50004 I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO FIND A JOB I SUPPOSE YOU'D SAY AND THEN FROM THAT JOB HAVE BASICALLY BEEN IN MY CAREER EVER
trainval/01GWGmg5jn8/50005 AND WHAT WE DO BETWEEN NOT TO BE MORBID NOT TO BE SOMBRE BUT WHAT WE DO BETWEEN THAT IS OUR LIVES
trainval/01GWGmg5jn8/50006 THAT IS REALLY WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT TO US
trainval/01GWGmg5jn8/50007 HOW WE IMPACT OTHERS HOW WE IMPACT THE WORLD AND THE LEGACY WE LEAVE BEHIND
trainval/01GWGmg5jn8/50008 I'D LOVE YOU TO GO AWAY AND THINK ABOUT THIS IN YOUR OWN TIME
trainval/01GWGmg5jn8/50009 THE REASON I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT REALLY MATTERS IN LIFE IS BECAUSE I THINK IT DETERMINES A LOT OF THE OTHER
trainval/01GWGmg5jn8/50010 BEING AWARE OF WHAT REALLY MATTERS WILL HELP DRIVE YOUR PATH
trainval/01GWGmg5jn8/50012 IF YOU KEEP ASKING WHY
trainval/01GWGmg5jn8/50013 WHAT WILL HELP YOU GET THERE
trainval/01GWGmg5jn8/50014 WHAT PEOPLE ARE YOU PASSIONATE ABOUT
trainval/01GWGmg5jn8/50015 WHO DO YOU ENJOY SPENDING TIME WITH
trainval/01GWGmg5jn8/50016 HE WORKED OUT WHAT MATTERED TO HIM HE STRUCTURED HIS LIFE AROUND THAT
trainval/01GWGmg5jn8/50017 I WAITED UNTIL I WAS IN MY LATE 20'S
trainval/01GWGmg5jn8/50018 IN MY FAITH
trainval/01GWGmg5jn8/50019 I DID NOT HAVE THE ANSWERS FOR A LONG TIME MY DAD EVEN LONGER
trainval/01GWGmg5jn8/50020 I WILL KEEP CHANGING MY ANSWERS
trainval/01GWGmg5jn8/50021 THOSE PRIORITIES WILL KEEP CHANGING THAT'S OKAY
trainval/01GWGmg5jn8/50022 I CERTAINLY KNOW THAT WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I DID NOT HAVE ANYWHERE NEAR ENOUGH LIFE EXPERIENCE AND WISDOM TO BE ABLE TO SET
trainval/01GWGmg5jn8/50023 I HAD NO IDEA
trainval/01GWGmg5jn8/50024 THAT'S WHY IT TOOK ME SO LONG
trainval/01GWGmg5jn8/50025 THAT'S WHY I WENT THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL TO UNIVERSITY TO A DEGREE THAT I TODAY DON'T ACTUALLY USE TO A JOB THAT
trainval/03h0dNZoxr8/50001 THIS HAS BEEN A RIDE MAN THIS HAS BEEN FANTASTIC
trainval/03h0dNZoxr8/50002 AND INTENSIVE CARE HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT
trainval/03h0dNZoxr8/50003 IN THE US IT'S 1 IN 5
trainval/03h0dNZoxr8/50004 THESE ARE THE FOUR WAYS TO GO
trainval/03h0dNZoxr8/50005 I THINK MOST PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BE DEAD
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50002 AND THAT ACTUALLY AT THAT MOMENT SOMETHING HAPPENED TO ME WHICH OBVIOUSLY MADE ME GO I'M GOING TO DOCUMENT
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50003 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50004 THAT WAS AN INCREDIBLE MOMENT
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50005 MAYBE THERE'S A LITTLE CHANGE I CAN GET INVOLVED IN
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50006 AND THAT WAS WHEN I HAD THE IDEA
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50007 THERE WAS NO STARTING POINT FOR PEACE
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50008 I WAS LIVING AT MY MOM'S PLACE
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50009 HE SAW THE BOMB GO OFF AT NAGASAKI
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50012 SO HE WAS LIKE MY HERO
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50013 AND VERY QUICKLY SOME LETTERS STARTED COMING BACK
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50014 AND I REMEMBER THE FIRST LETTER
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50015 ONE OF THE FIRST LETTERS WAS FROM THE DALAI LAMA
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50016 I THINK THE CAMERA IS
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50017 THIS MUST BE CREATED
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50018 KOFI ANNAN SAID THIS WILL BE BENEFICIAL TO MY TROOPS ON THE GROUND
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50021 ULTIMATELY THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50022 WHY DON'T WE ALL TEAM UP
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50023 WHY DON'T WE BRING TRUCE TO LIFE
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50024 WHY DON'T YOU SUPPORT THE PROCESS OF THE LARGEST EVER GLOBAL TRUCE
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50025 AND IT WAS 800 AM WHEN I STOOD THERE
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50026 I DECIDED THAT I'D CONTINUE FILMING AND MAKE ANOTHER MOVIE
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50027 AND I WENT BACK TO THE U
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50028 AND I WAS WAITING FOR HIM TO COME DOWN AND I KNEW THAT HE WAS ON HIS WAY
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50030 I THINK THERE'S A NUMBER OF PILLARS TO SUCCESS
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50031 AND THEN WE WENT HOME
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50033 WE HAD TO WAIT NOW AND SEE WHAT HAPPENED
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50035 I SAID WHAT WOULD YOU DO
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50037 IT'S ALL ABOUT THE INDIVIDUALS
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50038 IT'S ALL ABOUT PARTNERSHIPS
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50039 IT'S ABOUT YOUR CONSTITUENCIES IT'S ABOUT YOUR BUSINESSES
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50040 I WAS WITH BRAHIMI AMBASSADOR BRAHIMI
trainval/04SEzifEsGg/50041 IS THIS POSSIBLE
trainval/04VbxnzUwes/50001 IT SOUNDED WONDERFUL THIS NOT HAVING TO READ IN ORDER TO PLAY MUSIC
trainval/04VbxnzUwes/50002 SO I TRIED A FEW THINGS
trainval/05jJodDVJRQ/50001 WE NEVER SPOKE TO EACH OTHER FOR THREE DECADES AND THEN A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I DECIDED TO TURN THE SPOTLIGHT ON HIM
trainval/05jJodDVJRQ/50002 ACTUALLY YOU ARE
trainval/05jJodDVJRQ/50003 THEY INVENTED THAT TRADITION FOR THEIR ARRIVAL HERE
trainval/05jJodDVJRQ/50004 TIDY BOOTS IS VERY FUSSY ABOUT HIS FOOTWEAR
trainval/05jJodDVJRQ/50006 BUT I NEVER FELT THAT CONNECTION
trainval/05jJodDVJRQ/50007 IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT TO FUND A PRIVATE SCHOOL EDUCATION AND FEED HIS ARMY OF CHILDREN
trainval/06M8qY7Q74Y/50001 SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO GET AROUND THAT
trainval/06M8qY7Q74Y/50002 IT WAS NOT WITHOUT RISK THOUGH
trainval/06M8qY7Q74Y/50003 YOU JUST COULDN'T DO IT
trainval/06M8qY7Q74Y/50004 WE WERE ALWAYS MISSING SOME
trainval/06M8qY7Q74Y/50005 THIS COULD BE A PROBLEM
trainval/06M8qY7Q74Y/50006 IT WAS STUNNING AND NO ONE HAS DONE IT SINCE
trainval/06M8qY7Q74Y/50007 AND THAT'S JUST NOT GOING TO GET YOU THERE
trainval/08ZWROqoTZo/50001 POETRY CAN HELP US LIVE WITH THAT
trainval/08ZWROqoTZo/50002 POETRY HELPS ME WANT TO BE ALIVE AND I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHY BY SHOWING YOU HOW HOW A
trainval/08ZWROqoTZo/50003 I UNDERSTAND THE WORLD BEST MOST FULLY IN WORDS RATHER THAN SAY PICTURES OR NUMBERS AND
trainval/08ZWROqoTZo/50004 IT'S FURNISHED AT LEAST THREE SCIENCE FICTION TITLES I THINK BECAUSE IT SAYS POEMS CAN BRINGS US NEWS
trainval/08ZWROqoTZo/50005 IT'S ALSO ABOUT HOW APPEARANCES DECEIVE HOW OUR CULTURE CAN SWEEP US ALONG INTO DOING AND SAYING THINGS
trainval/08ZWROqoTZo/50006 THIS SUN IS NOT AFRAID TO SHOW HIS FACE
trainval/08ZWROqoTZo/50007 THE SCOTTISH POET DENISE RILEY COMPARES POETRY TO A NEEDLE A SLIVER OF OUTSIDE I
trainval/0af00UcTOSc/50001 AND THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU GET YOUR BRAIN INTO ENVIRONMENTS WHERE THESE NEW NETWORKS ARE GOING TO BE MORE LIKELY TO
trainval/0af00UcTOSc/50002 SO THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE
trainval/0af00UcTOSc/50003 SO THEY STARTED TO THINK COULD WE BUILD A NEONATAL INCUBATOR THAT'S BUILT ENTIRELY OUT OF
trainval/0af00UcTOSc/50004 IT WILL BE USEFUL IN 2020
trainval/0af00UcTOSc/50005 SO WHEN THEY WERE SITTING IN FRONT OF THE MICROSCOPE WHEN THEY WERE TALKING TO THEIR COLLEAGUE AT THE WATER COOLER AND ALL THESE THINGS
trainval/0af00UcTOSc/50007 I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS HAS HAPPENED
trainval/0af00UcTOSc/50008 AND THESE TWO GUYS ARE NAMED GUIER AND WEIFFENBACH
trainval/0af00UcTOSc/50009 AND THEY START TALKING AND ONE OF THEM SAYS HEY HAS ANYBODY TRIED TO LISTEN FOR THIS THING
trainval/0af00UcTOSc/50010 AND SO GUIER AND WEIFFENBACH GO BACK TO WEIFFENBACH'S OFFICE AND THEY START KIND OF NOODLING AROUND HACKING AS WE MIGHT CALL IT NOW
trainval/0af00UcTOSc/50011 IT WAS RIGHT AT 20 MHZ SO YOU COULD PICK IT UP REALLY EASILY BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID THAT PEOPLE WOULD THINK IT WAS A HOAX BASICALLY
trainval/0af00UcTOSc/50012 WE SHOULD RECORD IT
trainval/0af00UcTOSc/50013 THAT'S PRETTY COOL
trainval/0af00UcTOSc/50014 I MEAN HERE YOU HAVE THESE GUYS WHO BASICALLY THOUGHT THEY WERE JUST FOLLOWING THIS HUNCH THIS LITTLE PASSION THAT HAD DEVELOPED
trainval/0akiEFwtkyA/50001 IN LIGHT OF THESE TRENDS
trainval/0akiEFwtkyA/50002 AND HOW WILL THEY TRANSFORM OUR SOCIAL STRUCTURES
trainval/0Amg53UuRqE/50001 SO CLIMATE CHANGE
trainval/0Bhk65bYSI0/50001 I WAS ASKED A QUESTION BY DEFENSE CANADA
trainval/0Bhk65bYSI0/50002 IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DIAGNOSED EASILY
trainval/0Bhk65bYSI0/50003 WE HAD TWO GROUPS FROM THE MILITARY
trainval/0Bhk65bYSI0/50004 LET ME GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND
trainval/0Bhk65bYSI0/50005 THOSE WITH MTBI HAD DIFFERENT PATTERNS ON THE VARIOUS TASKS BUT THEY WERE
trainval/0Bhk65bYSI0/50006 SO PHYSICAL TRAUMA AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA HAD DISTINCT EFFECTS ON THE BRAIN
trainval/0Bhk65bYSI0/50007 AND IF YOU LOOK AT THIS NETWORK IT INVOLVES FRONTAL AREAS HIPPOCAMPAL AREAS TEMPORAL LOBE AREAS THAT ARE
trainval/0Bhk65bYSI0/50008 BUT THE SOLDIERS REACTED
trainval/0Bhk65bYSI0/50009 THEY COULDN'T GET ANY MORE WOUND UP
trainval/0bop3D7SdDM/50001 IT WAS THE KIND OF OBSESSION THAT HAD HER FAKING INJURIES JUST SO SHE COULD WEAR THEM
trainval/0bop3D7SdDM/50002 THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER THINGS THEY'RE DOING
trainval/0bop3D7SdDM/50003 IF A CHILD WATCHES A TYPICAL AMOUNT OF TELEVISION EVERY YEAR THEY WILL NOW BE SEEING
trainval/0bop3D7SdDM/50004 SO YOU MIGHT THINK WELL OK SO THE ANSWER'S SIMPLE
trainval/0bop3D7SdDM/50005 THEY'RE SAYING WELL WE'RE MARKETING TO KIDS LESS WE'RE DOING IT LESS
trainval/0bop3D7SdDM/50006 PROBABLY ALL OF US KNOW WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE THESE DAYS
trainval/0bop3D7SdDM/50007 73 OF TEENAGERS ARE NOW ON SOME SOCIAL MEDIA SITE
trainval/0bop3D7SdDM/50008 YOUTUBE FACEBOOK TWITTER
trainval/0bop3D7SdDM/50009 THE FOOD INDUSTRY IS ON ALL OF THESE PLATFORMS
trainval/0bop3D7SdDM/50010 THERE ARE NOW DOZENS OF WEBSITES OUT THERE DESIGNED FOR KIDS BY FOOD COMPANIES WITH FREE
trainval/0bop3D7SdDM/50011 THERE ARE SITES LIKE RONALD
trainval/0bop3D7SdDM/50012 I'M NOT JUST HERE TO TELL YOU HOW UPSET AS A PARENT I AM
trainval/0bop3D7SdDM/50013 I'M HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE STATE OF MAINE THAT WAS THE FIRST TO PASS A
trainval/0bop3D7SdDM/50014 COM WHICH IS MCDONALD'S SITE JUST FOR PRESCHOOLERS
trainval/0bop3D7SdDM/50015 I'M SEEING PROOF OF THAT EVERYWHERE I GO
trainval/0bop3D7SdDM/50016 THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY
trainval/0bop3D7SdDM/50017 IF YOU'RE A TEENAGER TODAY AND YOU'RE WALKING BY A MCDONALD'S YOU MIGHT JUST GET A TEXT MESSAGE PROMOTION FOR A BIG
trainval/0C5UQbWzwg8/50001 I BOTH LOVE AND HATE THE BUSINESS OF HUMAN RESOURCES AND YOU WILL SOON UNDERSTAND WHY
trainval/0C5UQbWzwg8/50002 AND THE BURDEN OF PROOF OF COURSE IS ON THEM NOT ON US
trainval/0d6iSvF1UmA/50001 SO IN 2000 WHEN IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE CITIZENSHIP APPLICATION FEE WAS GOING TO MORE THAN
trainval/0d6iSvF1UmA/50002 TWO THINGS HAPPENED AS WE COPED WITH LOSS AND RECOVERY IN NEW YORK CITY
trainval/0d6iSvF1UmA/50003 PEOPLE WHO WERE MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY YOUNG PEOPLE I HAD WORKED WITH WERE EXPERIENCING
trainval/0d6iSvF1UmA/50004 YOUNG PEOPLE I HAD WORKED WITH WERE BEING HARASSED NOT JUST BY CLASSMATES BUT ALSO BY THEIR
trainval/0d6iSvF1UmA/50005 AND IT'S THESE THREE THINGS IMMIGRANTS' VOTES VOICES AND VANTAGE POINTS THAT I THINK CAN HELP
trainval/0d6iSvF1UmA/50006 IT WILL COME AS NO SURPRISE TO YOU THAT THE MAJORITY OF VOTERS IN AMERICA ARE WHITE
trainval/0d6iSvF1UmA/50007 AND WHEN PEOPLE LIKE LAN ARE SITTING AT THE POLICY TABLE THEY CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE
trainval/0d6iSvF1UmA/50008 WE HAVE FOUGHT TO BE HERE
trainval/0d6iSvF1UmA/50009 IT'S NOT JUST MY WORK
trainval/0D9QIG36J9Q/50001 THE THESIS OF THIS TEXT IS ESSENTIALLY THAT
trainval/0D9QIG36J9Q/50002 AND IS IT BAD IF WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT MAKE A COUPLE OF CHANGES
trainval/0D9QIG36J9Q/50003 BECAUSE MEN ARE SCARY PIGS AND PATRIARCHY IS REAL
trainval/0D9QIG36J9Q/50004 PASSING AS A NATURAL WOMAN CAN DECIDE WHETHER I HAVE A GOOD DAY OR A BAD DAY
trainval/0D9QIG36J9Q/50005 MOST OF YOU AGREED WITH ME
trainval/0D9QIG36J9Q/50006 IT SUCKS BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS
trainval/0D9QIG36J9Q/50007 THIRTY FIVE YEARS AFTER THE PUBLICATION OF THE TRANSSEXUAL EMPIRE
trainval/0D9QIG36J9Q/50008 NOT ALL OF YOU HOWEVER
trainval/0D9QIG36J9Q/50009 AND IF I DON'T LOOK RICH BEAUTIFUL AND AMERICAN AM I STILL A WOMAN
trainval/0D9QIG36J9Q/50010 I STOPPED CUTTING MY HAIR
trainval/0D9QIG36J9Q/50011 I WORE DRESSES TO MORNING CLASSES
trainval/0D9QIG36J9Q/50012 MEN WHO JUDGE US TO BE NOT FEMME ENOUGH
trainval/0D9QIG36J9Q/50013 THEY JUST WORK
trainval/0D9QIG36J9Q/50014 THEY JUST ARE
trainval/0D9QIG36J9Q/50015 THINGS MEN IN THIS COUNTRY AREN'T REALLY ALLOWED TO DO
trainval/0FkuRwU8HFc/50001 WE UNDERSTAND THE HAZARDS OF 1 OF THEM
trainval/0FkuRwU8HFc/50002 HOW DOES NATURE CROSSLINK
trainval/0FkuRwU8HFc/50003 THAT'S WHAT YOU DESCRIBED RIGHT
trainval/0FkuRwU8HFc/50004 COULD COMPANIES ACTUALLY STOP COMPETING WITH EACH OTHER BUT COOPERATE
trainval/0FkuRwU8HFc/50005 WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE
trainval/0FkuRwU8HFc/50006 WE'RE DOING THAT NOW WITH OUR DESIGN CHALLENGES
trainval/0FkuRwU8HFc/50007 SO WHAT CAN YOU DO
trainval/0FOlwct8k9M/50001 IT WASN'T THAT FUNNY WHEN I WAS STANDING THERE TRUST ME
trainval/0FQXicAGy5U/50001 I'VE TOLD YOU THESE DISEASES ARE TERRIBLE
trainval/0FQXicAGy5U/50002 WHERE'S THE HOPE
trainval/0FQXicAGy5U/50003 AND THAT IN PART REFLECTS THE COMPLEXITY OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT
trainval/0FQXicAGy5U/50004 AND ONE OF THE BOTTLENECKS IS EARLY IN DRUG DISCOVERY
trainval/0FQXicAGy5U/50005 ALL THAT SCREENING OCCURS IN ANIMAL MODELS
trainval/0FQXicAGy5U/50006 THAT'S GREATER THAN ONE PERCENT OF THE GLOBAL GDP
trainval/0FQXicAGy5U/50007 TAKE A SKIN CELL MAKE IT A MASTER PLURIPOTENT CELL SO YOU COULD THEN MAKE THOSE CELLS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THEIR
trainval/0FQXicAGy5U/50008 AND THE CHALLENGE HAS LONG BEEN CAN WE HARNESS THE POWER THE UNDOUBTED POWER OF THESE STEM CELLS
trainval/0FQXicAGy5U/50009 I DON'T THINK MYSELF THAT WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT THOSE STEM CELLS HAVE MADE NEW MYELIN OR NEW NERVES
trainval/0FQXicAGy5U/50010 SO THIS IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT
trainval/0FQXicAGy5U/50011 I DO BELIEVE THAT THE DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES LIKE STEM CELLS THAT I'VE TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO YOU DO OFFER VERY REAL HOPE
trainval/0g2WE1qXiKM/50001 SO HOW CAN WE EVER DO ANYTHING NEW
trainval/0g2WE1qXiKM/50002 WHAT'S THE POINT
trainval/0g2WE1qXiKM/50003 THAT'S WHAT SCIENCE OFFERS US
trainval/0g2WE1qXiKM/50004 AND NOW WE WANT TO SHARE
trainval/0g2WE1qXiKM/50005 THAT'S THE NEXT STEP
trainval/0g2WE1qXiKM/50006 SO WE'RE GOING TO WRITE THIS UP AND TRY TO SUBMIT THIS FOR PUBLICATION
trainval/0g2WE1qXiKM/50007 AND THE DISCUSSION IS WHO CARES
trainval/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50001 I THINK IT'S THE PERSPECTIVE A LOT OF EMPLOYERS AND BOSSES HAVE TODAY BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH
trainval/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50002 IT WAS BACK IN 1975
trainval/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50003 I GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND I WAS RUNNING TO THE WASHROOM
trainval/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50004 I WAS READY TO GIVE UP ON MY DREAM
trainval/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50005 BUT A GUEST LECTURER CAME NEAR THE END OF MY UNDERGRAD
trainval/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50006 HIS NAME WAS BILL CAMERON
trainval/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50007 BILL WAS GIVING A GUEST LECTURE AND AT THE END OF THAT LECTURE HE SAID BY THE WAY I'M WORKING WITH THIS YOUNG MAN
trainval/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50008 HE HAS BROKEN HIS NECK VERY HIGH
trainval/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50009 I BLASTED DOWN THERE AFTER THE END OF THAT LECTURE AND INTRODUCED MYSELF
trainval/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50010 BILL SAW THIS PASSION IN ME
trainval/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50011 THAT I WANTED TO WORK ON INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITY
trainval/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50012 HE BECAME ONE OF MY REAL KEY MENTORS
trainval/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50013 I WENT BACK
trainval/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50015 NOT DISTRACTED BY UNNECESSARY DISCUSSION OR NOISES THAT AREN'T RELATED TO THE JOB
trainval/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50016 BRAIN COMPUTER INTERFACE ISN'T QUITE READY YET
trainval/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50017 I'LL THANK YOU
trainval/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50018 PEOPLE WITH ONE HAND WILL THANK YOU
trainval/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50019 AN EASY TO OPEN DOOR MIGHT ACTUALLY CATCH ON
trainval/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50020 HOW DO YOU DO THAT
trainval/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50021 MOST PRODUCTIVE BAKER I'VE EVER HAD
trainval/0HEXx3SP8kk/50001 AND IT RECEIVED QUITE A BIT OF ATTENTION
trainval/0HEXx3SP8kk/50002 WHEN I READ THAT I WAS BLOWN AWAY BY THOSE NUMBERS
trainval/0HEXx3SP8kk/50003 I WENT DOWN THERE IN THE WINTER TIME
trainval/0HYakD8XQ88/50001 THAT NOTHING WOULD EVER BE THE SAME AFTER THAT MOMENT
trainval/0HYakD8XQ88/50002 COME AT NIGHT
trainval/0HYakD8XQ88/50003 RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU'RE WITH ME
trainval/0HYakD8XQ88/50004 AND THAT'S NOT IT FOR ME
trainval/0hzSUUdTDUA/50001 AND THIS IS THE BIGGEST OXYMORON WE HAVE IN THE SOCIETY
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50001 IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR MOM TO PUT A BLANKET OVER THE BABY
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50002 IT'S NOT THE PAINTING WE WOULD HAVE PAINTED IT'S THE PAINTING THAT WE ACTUALLY PAINTED
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50003 SO SIMILARLY WHEN WE THINK ABOUT OUR PARTNER MTTS THEY'VE MADE SOME AMAZING TECHNOLOGIES
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50004 I'M GOING TO START WITH AN EXAMPLE FROM SOME WORK THAT WE DID ON NEWBORN HEALTH
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50005 SO HERE'S A PROBLEM
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50006 THIS IS WHAT WE WANT
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50007 THE PROBLEM IS WITHOUT TECHNICIANS WITHOUT SPARE PARTS DONATIONS LIKE THIS VERY QUICKLY
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50008 SO WE GOT STARTED
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50009 WE PARTNERED WITH A LEADING MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTION HERE IN BOSTON
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50010 WE CONDUCTED MONTHS OF USER RESEARCH OVERSEAS TRYING TO THINK LIKE DESIGNERS HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN LET'S FIGURE
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50011 IT WON LOTS OF AWARDS
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50012 I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS FOR US FOR WHAT I WANT TO DO IT'S EITHER TOO SLOW OR IT JUST DOESN'T
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50013 MANUFACTURING FINANCING DISTRIBUTION REGULATION
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50014 MICHAEL FREE AT PATH SAYS YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHO WILL CHOOSE USE AND PAY THE DUES FOR A PRODUCT LIKE THIS
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50015 SIR WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS AND WHO IS YOUR CUSTOMER
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50016 WHO IS OUR CUSTOMER
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50017 JAUNDICE AFFECTS TWO THIRDS OF NEWBORNS AROUND THE WORLD
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50018 SO HERE'S AN OVERHEAD WARMER AND A CPAP
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50019 WE TRIED THIS TIME TO GET IT RIGHT
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50020 AND HERE'S WHAT WE DEVELOPED
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50021 LAST STORY HERE
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50022 I'VE GOT A FRIEND IN INDIA WHO TOLD ME THAT YOU HAVEN'T REALLY TESTED A PIECE OF ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGY FOR
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50023 WE DECIDED WE CAN'T PUT A DO NOT ENTER SIGN NEXT TO THE VENT
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50025 SO FIREFLY'S TOTALLY SEALED
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50026 I HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO HOW PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO USE A DEVICE
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50027 ARE WE DESIGNING FOR THE WORLD THAT WE WANT
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50028 ARE WE DESIGNING FOR THE WORLD THAT'S COMING WHETHER WE'RE READY OR NOT
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50029 I GOT INTO THIS BUSINESS DESIGNING PRODUCTS
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50030 AND THAT'S DESIGN THAT MATTERS
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50031 THEY WANT BUCK ROGERS THEY DON'T WANT EFFECTIVE
trainval/0iTehgSOZ8A/50032 IT SOUNDS CRAZY IT SOUNDS DUMB BUT THERE ARE ACTUALLY HOSPITALS WHO WOULD RATHER HAVE NO EQUIPMENT THAN SOMETHING THAT LOOKS CHEAP AND
trainval/0ITHlySbhJE/50001 WE LOVE YOU NO MATTER WHAT
trainval/0ITHlySbhJE/50002 SHE SAYS SO I WENT THE NEXT DAY
trainval/0ITHlySbhJE/50003 I WAS IN LINE FOR REGISTRATION AND I LOOKED AROUND AND JUST KNEW I COULDN'T DO IT I WASN'T READY
trainval/0ITHlySbhJE/50004 I KNEW I HAD TO QUIT
trainval/0ITHlySbhJE/50005 WE'VE MADE IT ABOUT CHANGING THE WORLD
trainval/0ITHlySbhJE/50006 LOOK AT THAT
trainval/0ITHlySbhJE/50007 I KNEW I WAS WHERE I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE I KNEW I WAS HOME
trainval/0ITHlySbhJE/50008 AND I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO YOU ONCE IN THE FOUR YEARS SINCE THAT DAY
trainval/0ITHlySbhJE/50009 IF YOU THINK YOU HAVEN'T THINK OF ALL THE HANDS THAT DIDN'T GO UP WHEN I ASKED
trainval/0ITHlySbhJE/50010 YOU'RE JUST ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO HASN'T BEEN TOLD
trainval/0ITHlySbhJE/50011 IT IS THAT WE ARE POWERFUL BEYOND MEASURE
trainval/0ITHlySbhJE/50012 AND IF YOU CHANGE ONE PERSON'S UNDERSTANDING OF IT UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MUCH PEOPLE CARE
trainval/0JGarsZE1rk/50001 IMAGINE LADY LIBERTY THE BLINDFOLDED WOMAN HOLDING THE SCALE MEANT TO SYMBOLIZE THE BALANCE IN
trainval/0jmST6bSUoc/50001 USERS CAN REACH SUITABLE BLOOD DONORS WITHIN A CERTAIN RADIUS DIRECTLY AND SEND THEM
trainval/0K5OO2ybueM/50001 BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY BAD AT RESISTING TEMPTATION
trainval/0K5OO2ybueM/50002 AT THE END OF THE CALL THE JOURNALIST THREW IN A QUESTION THAT SEEMED LIKE A SORT OF SOFTBALL
trainval/0K5OO2ybueM/50003 WE GET SOME OF THAT FROM WORK AS WELL BUT WHEN PEOPLE LOOK BACK ON THEIR LIVES AND WONDER WHAT THEIR LIVES HAVE BEEN LIKE AT THE
trainval/0K5OO2ybueM/50004 AND THIS WAS HIS WAY OF CONVINCING THEM THAT IF IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR HIM IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEIR PETS
trainval/0K5OO2ybueM/50005 NOW OF COURSE SCREENS ARE MIRACULOUS IN A LOT OF WAYS
trainval/0K5OO2ybueM/50006 I COULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT 15 OR 20 YEARS AGO IN QUITE THE SAME WAY
trainval/0K5OO2ybueM/50007 SO THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD THAT COMES FROM THEM
trainval/0K5OO2ybueM/50008 ONE THING YOU CAN DO IS ASK YOURSELF WHAT GOES ON DURING THAT TIME
trainval/0K5OO2ybueM/50009 STOPPING CUES WERE EVERYWHERE IN THE 20TH CENTURY
trainval/0K5OO2ybueM/50010 AND THINK ABOUT NEWSPAPERS EVENTUALLY YOU GET TO THE END YOU FOLD THE NEWSPAPER AWAY YOU PUT IT ASIDE
trainval/0K5OO2ybueM/50011 THE SAME WITH MAGAZINES BOOKS YOU GET TO THE END OF A CHAPTER PROMPTS YOU TO CONSIDER WHETHER YOU WANT TO CONTINUE
trainval/0K5OO2ybueM/50012 THERE WERE STOPPING CUES EVERYWHERE
trainval/0K5OO2ybueM/50013 AT DAIMLER THE GERMAN CAR COMPANY THEY'VE GOT ANOTHER GREAT STRATEGY
trainval/0K5OO2ybueM/50014 YOU REALLY CONNECT WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THERE WITH YOU
trainval/0kPu6eKpja8/50001 IT'S OUT OF STYLE JUST AFTER A FEW MONTHS
trainval/0lS9NDZ8VZA/50001 WE TESTED A LOT OF SPECIMENS THERE AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT THEY ACTUALLY SAW OUR RESULTS
trainval/0lS9NDZ8VZA/50002 WE HAVE TO TRY THAT
trainval/0LxPAY9yis8/50001 AND THEY'LL HAVE AROUND THE WALLS SOME SMART BOARDS SO THAT THERE THEY CAN SEE THE PROGRESS THEY MAKE
trainval/0LxPAY9yis8/50002 SO DESIGNERS NEED TO BE ALL OVER THIS PROCESS
trainval/0LxPAY9yis8/50003 NOW THIS VEHICLE IS AN OBJECT LESSON IN BEING THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB
trainval/0LxPAY9yis8/50004 I GET INTO THE AIRCRAFT JOIN MY FELLOW PASSENGERS
trainval/0MD4Ymjyc2I/50005 SO WHAT WAS THE SOLUTION USING THE HARD APPROACH
trainval/0MD4Ymjyc2I/50006 WHAT DIFFERENCE DID IT MAKE IN THEIR ACTIONS THEIR CHOICES TO SIMPLIFY
trainval/0MD4Ymjyc2I/50008 WHAT IS THE SOLUTION
trainval/0MD4Ymjyc2I/50009 IMPROVE INTERPERSONAL FEELINGS THE MORE PEOPLE LIKE EACH OTHER THE MORE THEY WILL COOPERATE
trainval/0MD4Ymjyc2I/50010 LOOK AT HOME I HAVE TWO TVS
trainval/0MD4Ymjyc2I/50013 THIS IS WHAT THE AUTOMOTIVE COMPANY DID WHEN THEY SAW THAT MR
trainval/0MD4Ymjyc2I/50014 IT HAS A LOT OF IMPLICATIONS ON FINANCIAL POLICIES THAT WE USE
trainval/0MD4Ymjyc2I/50015 THE REAL BATTLE IS NOT AGAINST COMPETITORS
trainval/0MD4Ymjyc2I/50016 BY REMOVING LAYERS
trainval/0MD4Ymjyc2I/50017 WHEN THERE ARE TOO MANY LAYERS PEOPLE ARE TOO FAR FROM THE ACTION THEREFORE THEY NEED KPIS METRICS THEY NEED
trainval/0MMSpsvqiG8/50001 WEBSTER DEFINED IT AS THE ACCUMULATION OF MATERIAL POSSESSIONS OR THE ATTAINMENT OF A POSITION OF POWER OR PRESTIGE OR SOMETHING
trainval/0MMSpsvqiG8/50002 SO I WANTED TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING OF MY OWN
trainval/0MMSpsvqiG8/50003 I BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE
trainval/0MMSpsvqiG8/50004 IF YOU MAKE THE EFFORT TO DO THE BEST OF WHICH YOU'RE CAPABLE TRYING TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION THAT EXISTS FOR YOU I THINK THAT'S
trainval/0MMSpsvqiG8/50005 AND THAT'S NOT RIGHT
trainval/0MMSpsvqiG8/50006 A DOCTOR SITS BESIDE HIM WHOSE QUICK STEADY HAND MAY MEND A BONE OR STEM THE LIFE BLOOD'S FLOW
trainval/0MMSpsvqiG8/50007 I'D LEARNED THESE PRIOR TO COMING TO UCLA AND I DECIDED THEY WERE VERY IMPORTANT
trainval/0MMSpsvqiG8/50008 I BELIEVED IN THAT
trainval/0MMSpsvqiG8/50009 I BELIEVE IN TIME VERY IMPORTANT
trainval/0MMSpsvqiG8/50010 I DIDN'T WANT THAT
trainval/0MMSpsvqiG8/50012 I'M PAID TO DO IT
trainval/0MMSpsvqiG8/50013 NOT LIKE THE COACHES TODAY FOR GRACIOUS SAKES NO
trainval/0MMSpsvqiG8/50014 YOU AND I KNOW DEEPER DOWN THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE TO WIN THE CROWN
trainval/0MMSpsvqiG8/50015 BUT WHEN WE FAIL TO GIVE OUR BEST WE SIMPLY HAVEN'T MET THE TEST OF GIVING ALL AND SAVING NONE UNTIL THE GAME IS REALLY
trainval/0MMSpsvqiG8/50016 IT'S BEARING DOWN THAT WINS THE CUP
trainval/0MMSpsvqiG8/50017 IT'S YOU AND I WHO MAKE OUR FATES WE OPEN UP OR CLOSE THE GATES ON THE ROAD AHEAD OR THE ROAD
trainval/0MMSpsvqiG8/50018 I USED TO SAY THAT WHEN A GAME IS OVER AND YOU SEE SOMEBODY THAT DIDN'T KNOW THE OUTCOME I HOPE THEY COULDN'T
trainval/0MMSpsvqiG8/50019 I CAN NEVER ANSWER THAT
trainval/0MMSpsvqiG8/50020 WHAT WOULD YOU WANT
trainval/0MMSpsvqiG8/50021 BUT I'D WANT ONE THAT COULD PLAY TOO
trainval/0MMSpsvqiG8/50022 AND I WANTED THEM TO BE ABLE TO SHOOT FROM THE OUTSIDE
trainval/0MMSpsvqiG8/50023 HAVE I RAMBLED ENOUGH
trainval/0MYq1WJMmts/50001 EVENTUALLY I SURVIVED THAT DAY AND THE BATTLE DIDN'T REACH MY AREA
trainval/0MYq1WJMmts/50002 I NEEDED TO LEARN HOW TO WRITE ESSAYS MOTIVATION LETTERS PERSONAL STATEMENTS FILLING APPLICATIONS ALL OF THESE THINGS
trainval/0MYq1WJMmts/50003 AND I STRUGGLED TO LEARN THE LANGUAGE
trainval/0MYq1WJMmts/50004 BUT I MANAGED TO ACHIEVE MY TARGET AGAIN A GPA OF 3
trainval/0MYq1WJMmts/50005 I USED TO LIVE IN A PLACE WHERE THE SOUND OF MORTARS BULLETS JET FIGHTERS AND MISSILES DON T
trainval/0MYq1WJMmts/50006 AND PERSONALLY I SURVIVED DEATH MORE THAN TEN TIMES FROM MORTARS
trainval/0MYq1WJMmts/50007 I'M NOT GOING TO WASTE MY TIME ANY MORE ON THESE THINGS
trainval/0N1oA9LUEc4/50001 UNICEF STATES THAT THERE ARE OVER 2
trainval/0N1oA9LUEc4/50002 AND NEARLY 1 IN 4 24 SAID THAT THE BULLYING MADE THEM FEEL SUICIDAL
trainval/0N1oA9LUEc4/50003 DON'T TAKE OVER THE PROBLEM INSTEAD GIVE THEM SOME OF THAT POWER BACK AND WORK WITH THEM TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION
trainval/0N1oA9LUEc4/50004 AND YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T FORGET JUST HOW POWERFUL YOU ARE AND HOW YOUR PEERS
trainval/0N6cjPWqpSk/50001 EVERY 26 SECONDS SOMEONE DROPS OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL
trainval/0N6cjPWqpSk/50002 AND JESSE SOTO HAS GRIT AND THE ABILITY BY USING HIS VOICE TO CHANGE HOW
trainval/0nI65jgHG9o/50001 AND IT'S A STORY ABOUT A JAPANESE AMERICAN DETECTIVE IN LOS ANGELES IN
trainval/0nI65jgHG9o/50002 BUT I THINK WHAT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON IS THAT ACTUAL PHOTOGRAPHS OF HUMAN
trainval/0NV1KdWRHck/50004 IT ENDS WHERE IT BEGINS FROM TO COMPLETE ITSELF
trainval/0oAJsPFH2wk/50001 I WAS TOLD TO SHARE MY VOICE WHENEVER POSSIBLE
trainval/0oAJsPFH2wk/50002 WHY COULD THEY SHARE THEIR IDEAS SO EASILY AND I COULDN'T EVEN COME UP WITH A TOPIC
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50001 WHEN I TOOK THIS STAGE YOU ALL ASSUMED THAT I'M SOME CHILD GENIUS OR SOME ACCREDITED
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50002 I MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING WORTHY OF YOUR ATTENTION
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50003 BECAUSE I'M 17 AND I'M ON THIS STAGE YOU'RE ONLY RESPECTING ME BECAUSE I'M ON THIS STAGE
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50004 I'VE BEEN TOLD BY ADULTS THAT I'M NOT READY TO VOTE EVEN THOUGH I KEEP UP WITH POLITICS AND I'M SURE OF MY BELIEFS
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50005 WHAT CAN I TEACH YOU ABOUT
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50006 BUT BY THIS TIME I HOPE I'VE GAINED YOUR RESPECT
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50007 I SAY GAINED BECAUSE UNLIKE THE OTHER SPEAKERS I DIDN'T HAVE IT INITIALLY
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50008 I'D TRY TALKING TO AN ADULT ABOUT SOMETHING I'D BE WORKING ON MY RESEARCH OR A PROJECT AND
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50009 HOW COULD YOU KNOW THIS
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50010 FROM MY CONTRASTING EXPERIENCES AT ONE STONE AND WITH THE HELP OF THE AMAZING TEACHERS I'VE HAD I'VE BECOME FULLY
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50011 YOU DON'T DESERVE TO HAVE THE CONTROL OVER WHAT YOU LEARN
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50012 SOMETIMES I CATCH MYSELF ON A WILD TRAIN OF THOUGHT AND STOP MYSELF THINKING
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50013 YOU'RE ONLY 17 YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT PSYCHOLOGY
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50015 DO WE WAKE UP ON OUR 21ST BIRTHDAYS WITH EVERLASTING KNOWLEDGE
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50016 IT HASN'T SEEMED TO WORK SO FAR SO WHO'S RIGHT
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50017 THE ADULTS BEHIND THEM HAVE CONDITIONED ATTEMPTS AT SOLVING THEM WHICH IS WHY WE HAVEN'T MADE ANY
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50018 MAYBE THIS PROBLEM IS THAT WE'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT THESE SOLUTIONS CREATIVELY
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50019 THIS IS MY IDEA WORTH SPREADING
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50020 IN OTHER WORDS WE'RE TEACHING THEM TO STOP THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX AND TO ACCEPT ADEQUACY
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50021 SO THAT'S NOT LOGICAL EITHER
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50022 ASK US ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY ASK US ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION ASK
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50023 IT'S TRUE THAT NOT ALL OF US WILL UNDERSTAND THESE POLICIES RIGHT AWAY
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50024 JUST BECAUSE WE'RE TEENAGERS DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND POLITICS AND SIMILARLY JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE AN ADULT DOESN'T
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50025 I THINK THAT IT DOESN'T COME WITH AGE OR EXPERIENTIAL MATURITY
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50026 BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS WILL ONLY WORK IF IT'S A COLLABORATION
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50027 ADULTS I'M ASKING YOU TO WORK WITH US
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50028 GIVE US YOUR RESPECT HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50029 I'M NOT ASKING FOR BLIND FAITH I'M ASKING FOR YOU TO LET US PROVE IT
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50030 I CAN HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE TOO
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50031 WE NEED TO HOLD EACH OTHER ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANY PROGRESS TO BE MADE AND I PROMISE YOU IT WILL
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50032 I HAVEN'T WON A NOBEL PEACE PRIZE I HAVEN'T SOLVED INEQUALITY I HAVEN'T SOLVED POVERTY
trainval/0OkOQhXhsIE/50033 IT'S NO SECRET THAT SOCIETY HAS A LOT OF PROBLEMS THAT WE JUST CAN'T QUITE SEEM TO SOLVE
trainval/0P0mBj09vwk/50001 I DON'T KNOW
trainval/0P0mBj09vwk/50002 IS THAT EVEN ETHICAL
trainval/0P0mBj09vwk/50003 AND THAT WAS A RED FLAG FOR ME BECAUSE THAT'S MY AREA OF SPECIALTY AND I THOUGHT MAYBE THERE'S A WAY IN WHICH WE CAN
trainval/0P0mBj09vwk/50004 IT'S NOT VERY HEAVY I CAN DO IT WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM BUT NONETHELESS I LIKE TO HOLD ONTO IT
trainval/0P0mBj09vwk/50005 IN FACT THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY'VE DONE ANYTHING WRONG
trainval/0pzIPHWR3iY/50001 THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN
trainval/0pzIPHWR3iY/50002 TRUTH TELLING ACCORDING TO MICHAEL IGNATIEFF NARROWS THE RANGE OF PERMISSIBLE LIES
trainval/0pzIPHWR3iY/50003 I WOULD ADD TO THAT THAT BY NARROWING THE RANGE OF PERMISSIBLE LIES THE GROUND IS PAVED FOR AN HONEST ACKNOWLEDGMENT
trainval/0pzIPHWR3iY/50004 AND IF NECESSARY SHED YOUR RACIST SKIN
trainval/0Q1owhv3qAA/50001 BEFORE THIS TIME EDUCATION WAS BASED AROUND CONNECTING WITH ELDERS AND CONNECTING WITH
trainval/0Q1owhv3qAA/50002 AS THE WESTERN SOCIETY BECAME THE NORM SO DID MODERN SCHOOLING
trainval/0Q1owhv3qAA/50003 PROGRESS CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED THROUGH CUTTING CORNERS CREATING SHORTCUTS AND MAKING THINGS MORE
trainval/0Q1owhv3qAA/50004 AND WHAT BETTER WAY THAN WITH TECHNOLOGY
trainval/0Q1owhv3qAA/50005 I THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE REST
trainval/0QbLI1U4cLE/50001 AND WE PLANTED ON PRAIRIE
trainval/0QbLI1U4cLE/50003 CARING FOR THE PEOPLE CARING FOR NATURE SHARING
trainval/0qYTf9evWeY/50001 TRUST ME MR
trainval/0qYTf9evWeY/50002 BUT I'M SURE EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM HAS TAUGHT A GARY AND WHEN YOU'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF
trainval/0qYTf9evWeY/50003 SO WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
trainval/0qYTf9evWeY/50004 HE SAID BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER
trainval/0qYTf9evWeY/50005 I WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT SPORTS
trainval/0qYTf9evWeY/50006 HE'S AN 18 YEAR OLD BOY
trainval/0qYTf9evWeY/50007 BY NOW I'VE GOT PRIDE
trainval/0S3YDofSvGs/50001 THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION SAYS THE AVERAGE BODY MASS INDEX IS 21
trainval/0S3YDofSvGs/50002 WHAT DOES IT TELL US
trainval/0S3YDofSvGs/50003 CAN WE CHANGE THE MEDIA
trainval/0Sdja9Ys4Sg/50001 THIS IS WHY YOU NEED TO CARE
trainval/0Sdja9Ys4Sg/50002 WHAT IS AUTISM
trainval/0Sdja9Ys4Sg/50003 SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET THERE
trainval/0Sdja9Ys4Sg/50004 IT'S THE GROWTH TRAJECTORY OF THE BRAIN IT'S THE CHANGES THAT ARE HAPPENING ACROSS
trainval/0Sdja9Ys4Sg/50005 WHAT DOES THAT TELL US
trainval/0Sdja9Ys4Sg/50006 WE NEED TO GO DEEPER
trainval/0Sdja9Ys4Sg/50007 THIS INFORMATION IS NECESSARY FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS CAUSING THE DISORDER
trainval/0Sdja9Ys4Sg/50008 IF YOU THINK OF THEM AT A HIGH LEVEL OF ACTIVATION IN GREEN AND AT A LOW LEVEL OF ACTIVATION IN RED
trainval/0Sdja9Ys4Sg/50009 IT IS NOT A MONEY ISSUE A PERSONNEL OR LACK OF KNOW HOW
trainval/0Sdja9Ys4Sg/50010 THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO MAKE PROGRESS
trainval/0Sdja9Ys4Sg/50011 YOU THINK NOTHING OF CHECKING THAT BOX AT THE DMV TO SAY
trainval/0Sdja9Ys4Sg/50012 I AM AN ORGAN DONOR
trainval/0Sdja9Ys4Sg/50013 YOU'RE PROBABLY ASKING WILL MY BRAIN HELP
trainval/0Sdja9Ys4Sg/50014 THE ANSWER IS YES
trainval/0Sdja9Ys4Sg/50016 WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT IT THE BLANK LOOK THEY GET ON THEIR FACE WHEN THEY ASK ME WHAT DO YOU DO
trainval/0Sdja9Ys4Sg/50017 I CAME INTO THIS THINKING OH MY GOD
trainval/0Sdja9Ys4Sg/50018 I CAN'T IMAGE ANYTHING WORSE
trainval/0Sdja9Ys4Sg/50019 WE DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT
trainval/0Sdja9Ys4Sg/50020 WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH
trainval/0Sdja9Ys4Sg/50021 HIS NAME WAS GREYSON
trainval/0SkdP36wiAU/50001 NOW ENTROPY IS A COMPLICATED TERM BUT BASICALLY IT MEASURES THE STRENGTH OF PASSWORDS
trainval/0SkdP36wiAU/50002 AND SO WE NEVER ACTUALLY SAW ANYBODY'S PASSWORD
trainval/0snNB1yS3IE/50001 THE ONLY RULE IS DON'T THINK TOO HARD
trainval/0snNB1yS3IE/50002 SO I DECIDED TO GIVE IT A TRY
trainval/0snNB1yS3IE/50004 I DISCOVERED THIS BAR ON MANHATTAN'S LOWER EAST SIDE THAT HOSTED A WEEKLY POETRY OPEN MIC AND MY
trainval/0snNB1yS3IE/50005 IN FACT THEY WELCOMED ME
trainval/0snNB1yS3IE/50006 NEVER MIND THE FACT THAT I WAS 14
trainval/0snNB1yS3IE/50007 I CAN DO THIS
trainval/0snNB1yS3IE/50008 AS A WAY TO ENCOURAGE MY FRIENDS TO DO SPOKEN WORD WITH ME
trainval/0snNB1yS3IE/50009 BUT PHIL AND I DECIDED TO REINVENT PROJECT V
trainval/0snNB1yS3IE/50010 AND THAT WAS THANKS TO A GIRL IN A HOODIE
trainval/0snNB1yS3IE/50011 I ASKED HER WHAT THAT MEANT AND SHE SAID MISS IT'S KIND OF A LONG STORY
trainval/0snNB1yS3IE/50012 AND I SAID CHARLOTTE IT SOUNDS PRETTY INTERESTING TO ME
trainval/0snNB1yS3IE/50013 I WILL CONTINUE
trainval/0snNB1yS3IE/50014 I LOVE SPOKEN WORD
trainval/0snNB1yS3IE/50015 I'M ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND THE BEST WAY TO TELL EACH STORY
trainval/0snNB1yS3IE/50016 BUT I TEACH SPOKEN WORD POETRY BECAUSE IT'S ACCESSIBLE
trainval/0snNB1yS3IE/50017 I WILL KEEP COMING BACK WEEK AFTER WEEK
trainval/0snNB1yS3IE/50018 AND STEP THREE BEGAN WHEN I REALIZED I DIDN'T HAVE TO WRITE INDIGNANT POEMS IF THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS
trainval/0snNB1yS3IE/50019 I SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT THE BEST WAY TO TELL THIS STORY AND I WONDERED IF THE BEST WAY WAS GOING TO BE A POWERPOINT A SHORT
trainval/0snNB1yS3IE/50020 AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT MY BEGINNING WAS AT THE BOWERY POETRY CLUB BUT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT IT WAS MUCH EARLIER
trainval/0snNB1yS3IE/50021 AFTER THE A BOMB SPECIALISTS SAID IT WOULD TAKE 75 YEARS FOR THE RADIATION DAMAGED SOIL OF HIROSHIMA
trainval/0snNB1yS3IE/50022 BUT THAT SPRING THERE WERE NEW BUDS POPPING UP FROM THE EARTH
trainval/0snNB1yS3IE/50023 WHEN I MEET YOU IN THAT MOMENT I'M NO LONGER A PART OF YOUR FUTURE
trainval/0snNB1yS3IE/50024 BUT IN THAT INSTANT I GET TO SHARE YOUR PRESENT
trainval/0snNB1yS3IE/50025 SO NO MATTER THAT I HAVE INHIBITIONS TO FILL ALL MY POCKETS I KEEP TRYING HOPING THAT ONE DAY I'LL
trainval/0snNB1yS3IE/50026 IMPOSSIBLE IS TRYING TO CONNECT IN THIS WORLD TRYING TO HOLD ONTO OTHERS WHILE THINGS ARE BLOWING UP AROUND YOU
trainval/0SUTgoPUTLQ/50001 AND WE'D COME IN FROM PLAYING HE'D COME IN FROM PLOWING AND WORKING AND WE'D SIT AROUND THAT TABLE EVERY NIGHT
trainval/0SUTgoPUTLQ/50002 EVERYBODY UNDERSTOOD THAT WHEN WE LOSE SOMEBODY THE WINNERS ARE NOT GLOATING
trainval/0SUTgoPUTLQ/50003 THERE'S A WORLD BANK ARMS DEALERS AND A UNITED NATIONS
trainval/0SUTgoPUTLQ/50004 THERE'S ALSO A WEATHER GODDESS WHO CONTROLS A RANDOM STOCK MARKET AND RANDOM WEATHER
trainval/0SUTgoPUTLQ/50005 WE HAVE A LETTER IN THE GAME
trainval/0SUTgoPUTLQ/50006 LET'S ASK THAT MOM TO READ THE LETTER
trainval/0SW0HFy9Et4/50001 I WAS STARING AT HIM
trainval/0SW0HFy9Et4/50002 I WAS TOO AFRAID TO WIPE THE SPIT OFF MY FACE EVEN AS IT WAS MIXING WITH MY TEARS
trainval/0SW0HFy9Et4/50003 NOBODY SAID THAT
trainval/0SW0HFy9Et4/50004 I FELT LIKE THAT
trainval/0SW0HFy9Et4/50005 I'D HAD ENOUGH
trainval/0SW0HFy9Et4/50006 I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS ANYMORE
trainval/0SW0HFy9Et4/50007 MAYBE THERE ARE MORE OF MY PEOPLE OUT THERE
trainval/0SW0HFy9Et4/50008 AND I ALSO WANTED PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THE DEADLY CONSEQUENCES OF US NOT TAKING THESE PROBLEMS
trainval/0SW0HFy9Et4/50009 INSTEAD OF THE MONSTERS THAT I WAS LOOKING FOR THAT I WAS HOPING TO FIND QUITE FRANKLY BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY
trainval/0SW0HFy9Et4/50010 THEY'RE ALSO PROMISING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE THE THINGS THAT THEY CRAVE
trainval/0SW0HFy9Et4/50011 IN FACT I FOUND SOMETHING TO MY HORROR THAT I RECOGNIZED
trainval/0SW0HFy9Et4/50012 THE US AND THEM THE VILLAINS AND VICTIMS
trainval/0SW0HFy9Et4/50013 CAN WE FIND A WAY TO MAKE THEM FEEL DIFFERENTLY
trainval/0SW0HFy9Et4/50014 CAN WE MAKE OURSELVES CARE ABOUT THEM AND CONSIDER THEM TO BE OUR OWN
trainval/0SW0HFy9Et4/50015 AND NOT JUST BE OUTRAGED WHEN THE VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE LOOK LIKE OURSELVES
trainval/0sYguTPLpHE/50001 SO I MIGHT AS WELL DIVULGE SOME INFO
trainval/0sYguTPLpHE/50002 SO MONOGAMISH WHAT MIGHT THIS LOOK LIKE
trainval/0sYguTPLpHE/50003 WE ALL HAVE OUR LIMITS
trainval/0sYguTPLpHE/50004 OH BABE YOU LOOK SO HOT TONIGHT
trainval/0sYguTPLpHE/50005 I TOTALLY WANT TO BRING HER HOME WITH US
trainval/0TOkvcqeVQY/50001 BASED ON WHAT YOU SEE ON TV YOU WOULD THINK THAT THREE OF US WOULD BE IN SOME SORT OF LEGAL TROUBLE OR BARELY
trainval/0TOkvcqeVQY/50002 SHE SAID IT WAS EXPECTATIONS
trainval/0TOkvcqeVQY/50003 AND THESE EVENTS WILL INEVITABLY HAPPEN
trainval/0TOkvcqeVQY/50004 I WOULD CHALLENGE YOU THAT WHEN THESE EVENTS DO HAPPEN YOU WOULD CONTINUE TO SET HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR YOURSELF
trainval/0tqq66zwa7g/50001 WE DECIDED TO SEE IF WE COULD CHANGE THEIR MINDSET
trainval/0ueGFLVFi80/50001 IN FACT I'M SO OVERWHELMED THAT I CANNOT PUT THAT NUMBER INTO CONTEXT
trainval/0ueGFLVFi80/50002 I DON'T EXACTLY WALK AROUND WITH 135 BILLION DOLLARS IN MY WALLET
trainval/0ueGFLVFi80/50003 I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE YOU COULD DO WITH THAT MONEY
trainval/0ueGFLVFi80/50004 I DON'T KNOW
trainval/0ueGFLVFi80/50005 WE NEED TO ASK THAT QUESTION WE NEED TO HAVE A GOOD ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION
trainval/0ueGFLVFi80/50006 NOW WE'RE NOT GONNA VISIT ANY OF THOSE PLANETS IN MY LIFETIME
trainval/0ueGFLVFi80/50007 PROBABLY NOT IN MY CHILDREN'S LIFETIME BUT SOME DAY WE WILL
trainval/0ueGFLVFi80/50008 AND THEN THEY GO ON TO BECOME A GENETICIST OR A COMPUTER SCIENTIST OR AN APP DEVELOPER OR WHATEVER IT IS I THINK
trainval/0ueGFLVFi80/50009 THAT WAS THE PREVAILING STORY IN THE MEDIA
trainval/0ueGFLVFi80/50010 THAT'S A GAME CHANGER
trainval/0UmUgaJwEr0/50001 ONE IS KIND OF A PLACE OR A LOCATION OR A ROOM
trainval/0UmUgaJwEr0/50002 I'VE BEEN ASKING PEOPLE THIS QUESTION FOR ABOUT 10 YEARS
trainval/0UmUgaJwEr0/50003 WHERE DO YOU GO WHEN YOU REALLY NEED TO GET SOMETHING DONE
trainval/0UmUgaJwEr0/50004 WHY IS THAT HAPPENING
trainval/0UmUgaJwEr0/50005 YOU DON'T HAVE A WORK DAY ANYMORE
trainval/0UmUgaJwEr0/50006 YOU HAVE WORK MOMENTS
trainval/0UmUgaJwEr0/50007 WE PROBABLY WENT THROUGH IT YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE OR THE DAY BEFORE THAT
trainval/0UmUgaJwEr0/50008 IF YOU'RE INTERRUPTED AND WOKEN UP YOU HAVE TO START AGAIN
trainval/0UmUgaJwEr0/50009 WHICH IS RIDICULOUS BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE EXCUSES THAT MANAGERS GIVE
trainval/0UmUgaJwEr0/50010 AND I'M ONE OF THESE MANAGERS
trainval/0UmUgaJwEr0/50011 I CAN'T LET SOMEONE WORK AT HOME
trainval/0UmUgaJwEr0/50012 I HOPE THAT SOME OF THESE IDEAS WERE AT LEAST PROVOCATIVE ENOUGH FOR MANAGERS AND BOSSES AND BUSINESS
trainval/0UmUgaJwEr0/50013 YOU FIND A LOT OF OTHER DISTRACTIONS BUT NOT MANAGERS AND MEETINGS
trainval/0UmUgaJwEr0/50014 THEY'RE FOR INTERRUPTING PEOPLE
trainval/0UmUgaJwEr0/50015 THAT'S KIND OF BAD
trainval/0UmUgaJwEr0/50016 ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU TELL THEM THEY HAVE TO STOP DOING THAT TO DO SOMETHING ELSE
trainval/0UmUgaJwEr0/50017 IT'S 10 HOURS OF PRODUCTIVITY TAKEN FROM THE REST OF THE ORGANIZATION TO HAVE THIS ONE HOUR MEETING WHICH PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN HANDLED
trainval/0UmUgaJwEr0/50018 FIRST THURSDAY OF THE MONTH JUST THE AFTERNOON NOBODY IN THE OFFICE CAN TALK TO EACH OTHER
trainval/0UmUgaJwEr0/50019 THAT'S KIND OF RIDICULOUS
trainval/0UmUgaJwEr0/50020 SO IF YOU'RE A MANAGER START ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO USE MORE THINGS LIKE I
trainval/0wpCZxiAQzw/50001 LOOK I HAD THE GRADES TO PROVE IT
trainval/0wpCZxiAQzw/50002 SHE IS A GREAT MENTOR
trainval/0wpCZxiAQzw/50003 IT'S NOT THE MENTOR AT ALL
trainval/0wpCZxiAQzw/50005 AND BE SURE TO DIVERSIFY
trainval/0x2SkWRB8SA/50001 I'M NOT VERY SENSIBLE THOUGH
trainval/0x2SkWRB8SA/50002 A LOT OF US START WITH THE WRONG MOTIVATION TO LEARN A LANGUAGE
trainval/0x2SkWRB8SA/50003 THERE'S NO LANGUAGE GENE WE ALL HAVE IT ALREADY
trainval/0x2SkWRB8SA/50004 SO LET'S SAY THERE'S SOME INBORN TRAIT TO GIVE SOMEBODY 20 ADVANTAGE OVER THE REST OF THE PEOPLE
trainval/0x2SkWRB8SA/50005 AND I'VE DONE THIS WITH OTHER CULTURES AND OTHER LANGUAGES AND I EVEN MANAGED TO LEARN A LITTLE AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE
trainval/0x2SkWRB8SA/50006 BUT RATHER THAN BE IMPRESSIVE I THINK IT'S SO MUCH BETTER WHEN YOU EMBRACE THE BEGINNING STAGE OF LANGUAGE LEARNING
trainval/0x2SkWRB8SA/50007 AND I DO HAVE THE ABILITY I DO HAVE THE SKILL TO LEARN A LANGUAGE
trainval/0x2SkWRB8SA/50008 BUT I ALWAYS DID WE ALL ALWAYS DO
trainval/0Y8SIzP01lw/50001 AND ONE OF THEM IS THE EXTRAORDINARY SOCIAL COMPLEXITY OF THE ANIMALS AROUND US AND
trainval/0Y8SIzP01lw/50002 SO I SET OUT TO STUDY ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND ROBOTICS AND MY END OF STUDIES PROJECT
trainval/0Y8SIzP01lw/50003 IF SHE DIES ON THE ROAD THE WHOLE GROUP IS AT RISK
trainval/0Y8SIzP01lw/50004 SO THIS BEHAVIOR OF RISK AVOIDANCE IS A VERY OLD EVOLUTIONARY RESPONSE
trainval/0Y8SIzP01lw/50005 THEY ADAPT VERY SIMPLE RULES AND THE RESULTING COMPLEX BEHAVIOR ALLOWS THEM TO RESIST
trainval/0YeVt2kpSSo/50001 MY MOTHER HAD A FIT
trainval/0YeVt2kpSSo/50002 THEY GET THOSE THINGS MIXED UP
trainval/0YeVt2kpSSo/50003 THAT I WAS THE ONLY ONE
trainval/0YeVt2kpSSo/50004 EVEN THOUGH I HAD MET P
trainval/0YeVt2kpSSo/50005 I'M LIKE I HEAR YOU BROTHER I HEAR YOU
trainval/0YeVt2kpSSo/50006 I'M A MAINE BOY I'M A MAINE BOY AND IT WAS WEIRD TO MOVE TO LA
trainval/0YeVt2kpSSo/50007 IT WAS WEIRD BECAUSE YOU KNOW LA IS THE PLASTIC SURGERY CAPITAL OF THE COUNTRY
trainval/0YeVt2kpSSo/50008 IT'S THE SAME MOTIVATION
trainval/0YeVt2kpSSo/50009 WE JUST LABEL IT SOMETHING DIFFERENT
trainval/0YeVt2kpSSo/50010 IT'S OK IF THEY'RE LOOKING AT YOU
trainval/0YeVt2kpSSo/50011 I WANT YOU TO STAY THERE
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50001 THAT NIGHT I READ ALL OF THOSE ARTICLES AND FOUND A BUNCH MORE
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50002 WHEN I CAME TO SEE HER THE NEXT MORNING I HAD TO ADMIT THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50003 IT WAS AMAZING
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50004 I'VE BEEN USING IT EVERY DAY SINCE
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50005 IT'S THE BEST DRUG I'VE DISCOVERED
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50006 THAT WAS THE MOMENT AT WHICH I REALIZED I NEEDED TO LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT MEDICAL MARIJUANA
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50007 SO I STARTED READING MORE ARTICLES I STARTED TALKING TO RESEARCHERS I STARTED TALKING TO DOCTORS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY I
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50008 I ENDED UP WRITING A BOOK BASED ON THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND THAT BOOK REALLY REVOLVED AROUND THREE SURPRISES
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50009 I WAS ASKED AS A CONSULTANT TO SEE A WOMAN IN HER 70S RETIRED ENGLISH PROFESSOR
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50010 THOSE RISKS MAY NOT BE AS HUGE AND AS SCARY AS SOME OF THE OPPONENTS OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50011 TO SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT ANOTHER PATIENT
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50012 SHE WAS IN CONTROL
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50013 AND NOTE WHAT I SAID WHEN NOT IF
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50014 ALL OF US AT SOME POINT IN OUR LIVES WILL FACE A CHRONIC SERIOUS ILLNESS THAT CAUSES US TO LOSE
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50015 BUT WHAT SCARES THEM MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IS THIS POSSIBILITY THAT AT SOME POINT TOMORROW OR A
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50016 SO I DECIDED TO FIND OUT
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50017 I GOT A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION THAT WOULD LET ME BUY MEDICAL MARIJUANA
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50018 I WAS AMAZED AT HOW WILLING THOSE PEOPLE WERE TO SPEND SOMETIMES AN HOUR OR
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50019 THINK ABOUT THE LAST TIME YOU WENT TO ANY HOSPITAL OR CLINIC AND THE LAST TIME ANYBODY SPENT AN
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50020 WE NEED MORE RESEARCH INTO BENEFITS WE NEED MORE EVIDENCE ABOUT RISKS
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50021 AND YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50022 THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50023 WE DO NEED MUCH MORE EVIDENCE ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50024 WE ALSO NEED TO ASK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO RESCHEDULE MARIJUANA TO SCHEDULE II OR TO
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50025 MEDICAL MARIJUANA'S RISKS WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE RISKS OF RECREATIONAL USE WE KNOW NEXT TO NOTHING ABOUT THE RISKS OF MEDICAL
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50026 AND THAT'S A WAKE UP CALL WE REALLY NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50027 THESE ARE THE SORTS OF QUESTIONS THAT PATIENTS LIKE ROBIN GET ASKED ALL THE TIME
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50028 THESE ARE OFTEN SMALL MOM AND POP OPERATIONS RUN BY PEOPLE WITH NO MEDICAL TRAINING
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50029 HOW TO INTERACT WITH HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS WHEN TO INTERACT WITH HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS HOW TO USE MEDICATIONS
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50030 IN MY OWN PRACTICE I'VE GOTTEN MUCH MORE CREATIVE AND FLEXIBLE IN SUPPORTING MY PATIENTS IN
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50031 MANY OF THE DRUGS I PRESCRIBE ARE DRUGS LIKE OPIOIDS OR BENZODIAZEPINES WHICH CAN BE
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50032 BUT HERE'S THE POINT
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50033 THEY CAN BE DANGEROUS IF THEY'RE OVERUSED BUT THEY CAN ALSO BE INEFFECTIVE IF THEY'RE NOT USED IN A WAY THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH WHAT
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50034 THESE ARE THE SORTS OF QUESTIONS THAT MAKE ME CONFIDENT THAT THE PERSON I'M TALKING WITH REALLY HAS MY BEST
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50035 HUGE OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN FROM SOME OF THE TRICKS OF THOSE MEDICAL MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES TO PROVIDE MORE
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50036 ASKING PATIENTS ABOUT THEIR HOPES THEIR FEARS THEIR GOALS AND PREFERENCES
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50037 AS A PALLIATIVE CARE PROVIDER I ASK ALL MY PATIENTS WHAT THEY'RE HOPING FOR AND WHAT THEY'RE AFRAID OF
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50038 BUT HERE'S THE THING
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50039 WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50040 MEDICAL MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES AND CLINICS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE FIGURING THIS OUT
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50041 WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEIR TRICKS ARE WHAT THEIR TOOLS ARE AND WE NEED TO LEARN FROM THEM
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50042 PEOPLE I MET WERE MORE THAN HAPPY AS I WAS SITTING NEXT TO THEM PEOPLE LIKE ROBIN TO TELL ME
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50043 THOSE WAITING ROOMS REALLY ARE A HIVE OF INTERACTION ADVICE AND SUPPORT
trainval/0ygtX2nyexo/50044 AND THIRD THE FOLKS BEHIND THE COUNTER
trainval/0z03xkwFbw4/50001 OTHERS HAVE OPINIONS ON HOW MUCH SUGAR WE SHOULD EAT OR HOW MUCH SALT CHOLESTEROL SATURATED
trainval/0z03xkwFbw4/50002 FOR HUNDRED OF YEARS WE KNOW THAT BACTERIA LIVE WITHIN OUR BODY
trainval/0z03xkwFbw4/50003 THE OVERALL ALGORITHM COMBINED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SUCH RULES THAT IT AUTOMATICALLY DEDUCED FROM THE DATA
trainval/0z03xkwFbw4/50004 YOUR DIETARY FAILURES MAY NOT BE YOUR FAULT
trainval/0ZhL7P7w3as/50001 BY THE WAY TONY HAYWARD THE FORMER CEO OF BP HAD A PLAQUE ON HIS DESK INSCRIBED WITH THIS
trainval/0ZhL7P7w3as/50002 AS JARED DIAMOND AND OTHERS HAVE SHOWN US THIS IS HOW CIVILIZATIONS COMMIT SUICIDE
trainval/0ZOqbO2jIKg/50001 HAS ITS ISSUES BUT I WILL TALK ABOUT L
trainval/0ZOqbO2jIKg/50002 AND IT'S SINCE MOVED TO HER BONES AND HER BRAIN
trainval/0ZOqbO2jIKg/50003 AND WE WANTED TO CREATE HUNDREDS OF JOBS
trainval/0ZOqbO2jIKg/50004 WE THINK LOCAL AND WE ACT LOCAL
trainval/0ZOqbO2jIKg/50005 AND WHEN WE DO THAT OUR NEIGHBORS BE THEY NEXT DOOR OR IN THE NEXT OR NEXT COUNTRY
trainval/0ZOqbO2jIKg/50006 THAT WE'RE BUILDING OUR NATURAL DEFENSES PUTTING PEOPLE TO WORK RESTORING OUR NATURAL SYSTEMS
trainval/0ZOqbO2jIKg/50008 AND READING THAT BOOK MADE ME REEXAMINE THAT FEAR BECAUSE
trainval/0ZOqbO2jIKg/50009 I NEED TO EXPLAIN WHAT I MEAN BY THAT
trainval/0ZOqbO2jIKg/50010 SO YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO HELP HIM OUT
trainval/0ZOqbO2jIKg/50011 AND I'M A GROWN WOMAN NOW AND I HAVE LEARNED A FEW THINGS ALONG THE WAY
trainval/0ZOqbO2jIKg/50012 I STARTED MY FIRM TO HELP COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY REALIZE THEIR OWN POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE
trainval/10MvdLL2EpY/50001 IT'S JUST BECAUSE OF THE WAY IN WHICH OFFSHORE WORKS MOSSACK FONSECA HAS FEWER
trainval/10MvdLL2EpY/50002 WE GET AN INSIGHT INTO HOW CLIENTS AND BANKS AND LAWYERS GO TO
trainval/11Mq9ZuxZMc/50001 AND THAT NIGHT MANY NEARBY VILLAGES DID THE SAME AND WHEN THE WARDENS CAME THIS TIME THEY THREW UP THEIR
trainval/11Mq9ZuxZMc/50002 WITH THIS VICTORY THE VILLAGERS GAINED CONFIDENCE AND ONCE AGAIN BEGAN TO PASS ON THEIR TRADITIONS TO THEIR
trainval/11Mq9ZuxZMc/50003 FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE I KNEW HOW VALUABLE RITES OF PASSAGE WERE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE
trainval/11Mq9ZuxZMc/50004 IT'S AN IMPORTANT SKILL SET
trainval/12OAr0lt4bk/50001 AND SHE SAID I'LL NEVER FORGET IT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING YOU WANT TO SAY TO A MOTHER THAT'S HAVING A BABY FOR THE FIRST TIME
trainval/12OAr0lt4bk/50002 IT WAS IN THEORY AND HOPEFULLY IN PRACTICE A SMART ONLINE MAGAZINE ABOUT SEX AND
trainval/12OAr0lt4bk/50003 AND I WAS THERE WITH MY ARMS OPEN
trainval/12OAr0lt4bk/50004 BUT I THINK A LOT OF MEN DO GO THROUGH THIS SENSE IN THE EARLY MONTHS MAYBE THEIR FIRST YEAR THAT
trainval/12OAr0lt4bk/50005 I FELT LIKE I WAS A VESSEL OF THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY
trainval/12OAr0lt4bk/50006 PEOPLE I INTERACTED WITH DAILY WORKED WITH WAS FRIENDS WITH FAMILY MEMBERS THAT I HAD KNOWN A LONG TIME HAD NEVER
trainval/12OAr0lt4bk/50007 AND I THINK WITH A DEATH YOU HAVE A FUNERAL YOU CELEBRATE THE LIFE AND THERE'S A LOT OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT AND IT'S SOMETHING
trainval/12OAr0lt4bk/50008 SO I'M NOT GOING TO GO
trainval/12OAr0lt4bk/50009 EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT WORK WITH YOUR SPOUSE
trainval/13rqtiAPISY/50001 WILL YOU BUY SOMEONE ELSE'S SAMPLE
trainval/14rYeATuCqQ/50001 I LOST MY JOY
trainval/14rYeATuCqQ/50002 SOME OF US SAY IT BUT WE DON'T MEAN IT
trainval/14rYeATuCqQ/50003 THE WONDERFUL THING ABOUT ALL OF US IS AS WE GROW AND WE BEGIN TO EXPERIENCE LIFE
trainval/14rYeATuCqQ/50004 IT WAS A PLEASURE IT WAS AN HONOUR TO BE SOMEONE WHO COULD PROVIDE LAUGHTER
trainval/14rYeATuCqQ/50005 THEY UNDERSTAND THE DEEPNESS OF LOVE
trainval/14rYeATuCqQ/50006 BUCKLE YOUR SEAT BELT UP IN YOUR CAR
trainval/14rYeATuCqQ/50007 LIFE'S A CRAPSHOOT MAN
trainval/150cqgYh8sQ/50001 NOBODY WANTED TO WORK THERE IT WAS ALWAYS UNDERSTAFFED BECAUSE NOBODY WANTED TO GO TO DONALDSON
trainval/150cqgYh8sQ/50002 NOBODY FELT SAFE
trainval/150cqgYh8sQ/50003 THE PRISONERS WEREN'T SAFE
trainval/150cqgYh8sQ/50004 THE STAFF WASN'T SAFE
trainval/150cqgYh8sQ/50005 IT REQUIRES 100 HOURS OF MEDITATION IN SILENCE AND STILLNESS OVER A 10 DAY PERIOD OF
trainval/150cqgYh8sQ/50006 EAST MEETS WEST IN THE DEEP SOUTH
trainval/150cqgYh8sQ/50007 WHEN THE MIND WONDERS THEY HAVE TO COME BACK TO THE BREATH OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
trainval/150cqgYh8sQ/50008 AT THE END OF THE 30 HOURS THEIR MINDS WERE SHARP AND FOCUSED AND ON
trainval/150cqgYh8sQ/50009 AS MEMORIES ROSE TO THE SURFACE THEY HAD TO FACE THOSE MEMORIES
trainval/150cqgYh8sQ/50010 BIG ED HAD TO FACE THE THAT HIS DAUGHTER HAD DIED
trainval/150cqgYh8sQ/50011 THEY COULDN'T BE PROVOKED OR UPSET SO EASILY
trainval/150cqgYh8sQ/50012 WAYNE WAS UNABLE TO SIT AND FOCUS
trainval/150cqgYh8sQ/50013 HE WAS SQUIRMING JUMPING AND RUNNING FROM THE MAT
trainval/150cqgYh8sQ/50014 BUT WHEN I FIRST STARTED DOCUMENTING THIS STORY I THOUGHT MAYBE THE DHAMMA BROTHERS CAN BECOME TEACHERS
trainval/150cqgYh8sQ/50015 SO FINALLY IN THAT MOMENT WITH THAT WISE ADVISE HE SAT AND WENT INSIDE AND FACED HIMSELF
trainval/150cqgYh8sQ/50016 EVERYBODY WAS THINKING
trainval/16cMSRFid9U/50001 THERE'S A COMPLETE STRANGER SLEEPING IN MY LIVING ROOM
trainval/16cMSRFid9U/50002 I'VE GOT A 30 SECOND EXPERIMENT THAT WILL PUSH YOU PAST YOUR COMFORT ZONE
trainval/16cMSRFid9U/50003 HOW DO SHARING AND TRANSACTIONS GO TOGETHER
trainval/16p9YRF0lSg/50001 TO WHICH HE REPORTED MOST OF THEM REPLIED HELL NO
trainval/16p9YRF0lSg/50002 THEY WERE CURED
trainval/16p9YRF0lSg/50003 THAT TRANSFORMATION IS AMAZING
trainval/16p9YRF0lSg/50004 WE SEE IT AT THE D
trainval/16p9YRF0lSg/50005 AND BRIAN'S SHOULDERS SANK
trainval/16p9YRF0lSg/50006 IF THERE IS ONE FOR ME THIS IS IT TO HELP THIS HAPPEN
trainval/19Hj93IgbeQ/50001 YOU DON'T WANT TO DRIVE DRUNK YOU DON'T WANT TO DIVE DRUNK
trainval/19Hj93IgbeQ/50002 WE NEEDED MORE TIME
trainval/19KkFCQz8WQ/50001 THEY HAD COME FROM THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY
trainval/19KkFCQz8WQ/50002 IT DOESN'T SURVIVE IN THE ENVIRONMENT HARDLY AT ALL
trainval/19KkFCQz8WQ/50003 WE HAVE A BIG GAP IN THAT MONEY
trainval/19KkFCQz8WQ/50004 WE'RE CUTTING CORNERS AND EVERY TIME WE CUT CORNERS MORE PLACES GET INFECTED THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE AND IT JUST SLOWS US
trainval/1BfMMoLYMlg/50001 I NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND CHEMISTRY TO UNDERSTAND A FANTASTIC NEW MACHINE THAT MY SUPERVISOR A
trainval/1BfMMoLYMlg/50002 BECAUSE I'D BROKEN THE MACHINE
trainval/1BfMMoLYMlg/50003 I WAS CONVINCED THE ONLY REASON WE COULD BE SEEING THESE RESULTS WAS BECAUSE OF ME THE NOVICE
trainval/1BfMMoLYMlg/50004 I STILL DIDN'T KNOW
trainval/1BfMMoLYMlg/50005 SO INSTEAD I WAS USING A PILOT PROTEIN CALLED LYSOZYME
trainval/1BfMMoLYMlg/50006 I LOVED LEARNING ABOUT THE BODY SYSTEMS AND HOW THEY WORKED
trainval/1BfMMoLYMlg/50007 AS SOON AS TWO MONTHS LATER I WAS BEING FLOWN TO CALIFORNIA TO WORK IN GREG'S LAB
trainval/1BfMMoLYMlg/50008 THIS RESEARCH TOPIC WAS CONCERNED WITH DESIGNING NEW DRUGS FOR CANCER TREATMENT
trainval/1BfMMoLYMlg/50009 AND THAT I WAS RECEIVING AN AWARD FOR CHEMISTRY OF ALL THINGS
trainval/1BHOflzxPjI/50001 UNPAID CARE ECONOMY
trainval/1BHOflzxPjI/50002 AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE WE FACE GETTING EVERYBODY OUT OF POVERTY AND COMING BACK WITHIN WHAT
trainval/1BXYSGepx7Q/50001 IT CAN CUT IT FROM WEEKS TO DAYS
trainval/1BXYSGepx7Q/50002 BUT RIGHT NOW IF YOU WANT TO GET INTO THE WHOLE BODY YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE TO USE A VIRUS
trainval/1CdmpHLSZRU/50001 YOU CAN KEEP IT TO YOURSELF
trainval/1cJiAS6NSUI/50001 YOU'VE GOT SOME KIND OF WALL THERE YOU'VE SOME KIND OF UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU WANT TO GET ACROSS AND IT'S THE
trainval/1cJiAS6NSUI/50002 I'VE GOT THESE INNOVATIONS THAT I'M LOOKING FOR AND I CAN ALSO SEE THAT SOME OF THESE WE'VE SEEN BEFORE IN FACT ONE OF
trainval/1cJiAS6NSUI/50003 I GET TO TEACH UNIVERSITY PHYSICS CLASSES I GET TO RUN SCIENCE PROGRAMMES FOR KIDS AND THEIR FAMILIES
trainval/1cJiAS6NSUI/50004 WE NEED TO START THE SPACE RACE AND PROTECT OURSELVES FROM SOME NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST
trainval/1cJiAS6NSUI/50005 I SEE ALL OF THESE INNOVATIONS THAT I'M TOLD OR OFFERED AS THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO INNOVATE WHAT YOU'RE
trainval/1cJiAS6NSUI/50006 SO I TURNED TO A SCRAPBOOK I HAVE I COLLECT PICTURES OR I TAKE PICTURES IN THE SCRAPBOOK
trainval/1cJiAS6NSUI/50007 SO THAT'S KIND OF MY QUEST THAT IS MY DREAM AND THAT'S THE KIND OF PATH I WANT TO TAKE YOU ALONG WITH ON THIS PARTICULAR TALK
trainval/1cJiAS6NSUI/50008 THE FIRST IS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OVERHEAD PROJECTORS AND WE TALK ABOUT MOOCS AND WE TALK ABOUT OPEN EDUCATIONAL
trainval/1cJiAS6NSUI/50009 BUT OF COURSE LEARNING IS A LOT MORE THAN THAT
trainval/1cJiAS6NSUI/50010 WE CAN'T WAIT FOR AN INNOVATION TO COME DOWN FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE AND BE BESTOWED UPON US TO SAVE OUR
trainval/1CN7PF10RKo/50001 SOMETHING IS NOT QUITE RIGHT
trainval/1CN7PF10RKo/50002 DON'T ADD BACK THE OIL FAT AND SUGAR IT'S A LOT CHEAPER IT REALLY WORKS
trainval/1COwySxiwSg/50001 BUT IN REALITY HE WAS JUST AS MISERABLE AS I WAS
trainval/1Dd2yCf3PyA/50001 BUT WHAT IF YOU HAD NO VOICE
trainval/1EHZAQmw2JA/50001 SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER THE KODAK MOMENT BUT THAT REALLY WAS JUST A MOMENT IN TIME BECAUSE
trainval/1EHZAQmw2JA/50002 HOW DID YOU ADAPT
trainval/1EIQ6nSSXxk/50001 PRIMARY SCHOOLS ARE FREE IN MALAWI
trainval/1fZ4XOnnh1c/50001 I HAVE TO SERVE
trainval/1fZ4XOnnh1c/50002 IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE IN THE CLOSET
trainval/1fZ4XOnnh1c/50003 I BECAME A MEMBER OF TREATMENT ACTION CAMPAIGN AND I'M VERY PROUD TO BE A MEMBER OF THAT INCREDIBLE
trainval/1fZ4XOnnh1c/50004 SING CAMPAIGN IS BASICALLY JUST ME AND ABOUT THREE OR FOUR WONDERFUL PEOPLE WHO HELP TO SUPPORT ME
trainval/1fZ4XOnnh1c/50005 THE MESSAGE THAT UNAIDS ARE CURRENTLY SENDING OUT TO THE WORLD IS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE VIRTUAL
trainval/1fZ4XOnnh1c/50006 AND HER BABY WILL RECEIVE PMTCT WHICH WILL MEAN THAT THAT BABY CAN BE BORN FREE OF THE
trainval/1fZ4XOnnh1c/50007 NOW THAT IS PREVENTION AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF LIFE
trainval/1fZ4XOnnh1c/50008 SO IT WAS OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A VERY EMOTIONAL ENCOUNTER AND LEFT US FEELING VERY RESONANT WITH THIS
trainval/1fZk6aWnqGg/50001 THINGS THAT YOU DO BECAUSE OTHER CHARITIES DO THEM
trainval/1fZk6aWnqGg/50002 WE STOPPED DOING CERTAIN THINGS TELLING OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS HOW TO SPEND THE MONEY WE GAVE
trainval/1fZk6aWnqGg/50003 WE ALWAYS TRIED TO AVOID IT BUT WE REALLY STEPPED BACK AND SAID LOOK THIS IS YOUR CASH IT'S YOUR RAINFOREST
trainval/1fZk6aWnqGg/50004 WHAT'S GOING TO WORK BEST FOR YOUR COMMUNITIES
trainval/1fZk6aWnqGg/50006 WE ARE NOW A REGISTERED CHARITY IN THE US WE'RE TALKING TO FOUNDATIONS WE COULDN'T HAVE POSSIBLY GOT HOLD OFF BEFORE
trainval/1fZk6aWnqGg/50007 WE HAVE DISNEY NOW FUNDING SOME FANTASTIC BIODIVERSITY WORK
trainval/1fZk6aWnqGg/50008 SO ANYTHING THAT WE COLLECT IN 2016 WE'RE BRINGING DIRECTLY TO OUR PARTNERSHIPS IN THE RAINFOREST
trainval/1fZk6aWnqGg/50010 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/1G8dQQrlbbA/50001 SO THERE'S LOTS OF NOISE AND LOTS OF THINGS CAN GO WRONG
trainval/1G8dQQrlbbA/50002 BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE GROWING A PLANT WHERE IT TAKES PERHAPS SEVERAL YEARS TO DO A SINGLE EXPERIMENT
trainval/1G8dQQrlbbA/50003 DO ALL YOUR PIPES SUDDENLY GET DIGESTED
trainval/1G8dQQrlbbA/50004 ONE OF THE BEST FORCES OUT THERE TO HELP UNDERSTAND ALL OF THIS THOUGH HAS BEEN ONE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITIES
trainval/1gAQ82IHyZ8/50001 WE LOVE BACK OF ENVELOPE CALCULATIONS
trainval/1gAQ82IHyZ8/50003 I'VE TRIED IT
trainval/1gAQ82IHyZ8/50005 WE NEED A PLAN THAT ADDS UP
trainval/1gdKrtwBGqY/50001 SO THE QUESTION IS CAN WE BRIDGE THIS GULF
trainval/1Gtc0ounD5I/50001 DISPLEASING TRAITS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO FACE THAT WE DON'T WANT TO
trainval/1Gtc0ounD5I/50002 AND VICE VERSA
trainval/1Gtc0ounD5I/50003 AND THEN WE CAN CONFRONT THE SHADOW
trainval/1Gtc0ounD5I/50004 WORLD MYTHOLOGIES AND RELIGIONS ARE FULL OF EXAMPLES OF HEROES WHO CHOSE THIS WAY IN ORDER TO BE
trainval/1Gtc0ounD5I/50005 EACH ONE OF US ENCOMPASSES THE OTHER EACH ONE OF US ENCOMPASSES THAT FORCE THAT WE PUT BEHIND
trainval/1Gtc0ounD5I/50006 LET'S ALLOW FOR THE CREATION OF A COMMON DREAM
trainval/1gTNgijhKzw/50001 IN FACT I KNOW OF MULTIPLE CASES WHERE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PICKED UP BECAUSE THEY WERE IN
trainval/1gTNgijhKzw/50002 ALL HE KNEW WAS HE HAD TO FIND A PLACE TO SLEEP AND TO GET TO HIS FIRST PAROLE APPOINTMENT IN A COUPLE OF
trainval/1gTNgijhKzw/50003 OF COURSE WHEN HE TOLD HIS PAROLE OFFICER THAT HE LOST HIS JOB WELL THEN SHE WAS REALLY
trainval/1gTNgijhKzw/50004 WHY WOULD THIS KIND OF THING NOT WORK FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE EVEN MORE THINGS TO MANAGE
trainval/1gTNgijhKzw/50005 BUT IF WE ARE ABLE TO SHARE INFORMATION IN A WAY THAT RESPECTS MICHAEL'S PRIVACY
trainval/1gTNgijhKzw/50006 THIS REALLY IS WORTH WORKING ON
trainval/1hxwsYYz5fI/50001 IT'S LIKE OK IT WAS CUTE IN THE BEGINNING BUT NOW IT'S NOT
trainval/1hxwsYYz5fI/50002 IT CAN BE HAPPY
trainval/1hxwsYYz5fI/50003 A CYCLE OF ENCOURAGING OTHERS TO BE HAPPY TO SPREAD THAT HAPPINESS BECAUSE ONE PERSON IS ALL THAT
trainval/1InHN8JPazA/50001 SO WE STARTED OUR JOURNEY
trainval/1isiSaTSXb8/50001 I MUST ADMIT WHEN I FIRST WENT TO MY CEREMONY I WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHAT TO EXPECT
trainval/1isiSaTSXb8/50002 BUT IT WAS UNBELIEVABLY MOVING
trainval/1IxIDGyISzk/50001 NOT BECAUSE I WAS IN PAIN OR BECAUSE TREATMENT WAS DIFFICULT
trainval/1IxIDGyISzk/50002 I'D PEOPLE WHO LATER TOLD ME THAT THEY THOUGHT I WAS DEAD
trainval/1IxIDGyISzk/50003 WE ALL LIVED WITH THE CONSTANT FEAR THAT I COULD DIE AT ANY MOMENT
trainval/1IxIDGyISzk/50004 AND TODAY WITH ONLY THREE HOURS OF TIME I ACCOMPLISHED A MAJOR GOAL IN MY LIFE AND I
trainval/1IxIDGyISzk/50005 HOWEVER THEY WOULD CHECK UP ON ME
trainval/1IxIDGyISzk/50006 EVEN MORE SO ONE OF MY INTERNET FRIENDS WAS ACTUALLY A MEDICAL RESEARCHER AND HE CONNECTED ME WITH SOME OF
trainval/1IxIDGyISzk/50007 WITH HIS RECOMMENDATIONS I MET WITH DOCTORS WHO ULTIMATELY GAVE ME CRITICAL ADVICE THAT KEPT ME ALIVE
trainval/1IxIDGyISzk/50008 THROUGHOUT THE NEXT TWO YEARS I SLOWLY BEGAN TO RECOVER
trainval/1IxIDGyISzk/50009 HOWEVER I COULDN'T HELP BUT LOOK BACK AND THINK TO MYSELF
trainval/1IxIDGyISzk/50010 THESE GAMES LIKE LEAGUE OF LEGENDS' WERE NOT DESIGNED TO HELP ME
trainval/1IxIDGyISzk/50011 GIVING THEM HOPE AND GIVING THEM INSPIRATION
trainval/1IxIDGyISzk/50012 WELL I'M A GAMER AND I PLAY AROUND THREE HOURS OF LEAGUE OF LEGENDS EVERY DAY
trainval/1IxIDGyISzk/50013 I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THAT THE BEST WAY TO LEARN IS THROUGH PLAY AND THAT MAKES VIDEO GAMES THE BEST
trainval/1IxIDGyISzk/50014 A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS IS GAME CALLED DRAGON BOX THAT TEACHES ALGEBRA THROUGH PLAY
trainval/1IxIDGyISzk/50015 VIDEO GAMES DEFINE OUR WORLD
trainval/1IxIDGyISzk/50016 THROUGH MY STUDIES I FOUND THAT VIDEO GAMES ARE ACTUALLY AMAZING TOOLS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL
trainval/1IxIDGyISzk/50017 CHALLENGE IS ACTUALLY A VERY UNIQUE TRAIT FOUND IN VIDEO GAMES
trainval/1IxIDGyISzk/50018 AND THAT'S RIGHT
trainval/1IxIDGyISzk/50019 VIDEO GAMES ARE NOT JUST TOYS FOR KIDS AND WE MUST TREAT THEM WITH A PRACTICAL PERSPECTIVE
trainval/1IxIDGyISzk/50020 IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY ARE
trainval/1IxIDGyISzk/50021 WITH THE RECENT EXPANSION OF VIRTUAL REALITY TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES CEO'S ARE ABLE TO HAVE IN PERSON
trainval/1IxIDGyISzk/50022 A RESEARCH STUDY THAT I'M CONDUCTING RIGHT NOW SHOWS EVIDENCE THAT THE AMOUNT OF BRAIN PROCESSING POWER THAT IT TAKES TO
trainval/1JxxCB9GiGU/50001 I ALSO MIST HIS HOME EVERYDAY
trainval/1JxxCB9GiGU/50002 WAIT FOR IT
trainval/1KFUSfbcwfw/50001 I STARTED TO FREAK OUT
trainval/1KFUSfbcwfw/50002 I CAN'T DESCRIBE TO YOU HOW QUICKLY I WANTED TO DIVE INTO NUMBNESS GET AWAY FROM THE
trainval/1KFUSfbcwfw/50003 AND FROM THESE WORDS THAT I COULD TAKE SHELTER IN I MADE ENTIRE PINTEREST BOARDS AND FROM THOSE BOARDS I
trainval/1KFUSfbcwfw/50004 THERE IS NOTHING SHAMEFUL ABOUT BEING A FEMINIST
trainval/1KS10q6N2A8/50001 THERE'S AN UNDERSTANDING WITH YOUR PROFESSOR THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO CLASS BUT IF YOU DON'T YOU'LL FAIL
trainval/1KS10q6N2A8/50002 AND IT'S THE FIRST MOVIE THAT GOT US SOME AMOUNT OF ATTENTION FROM THE PORTLAND FILM SCENE
trainval/1l4B16s5i78/50001 FOR ME WHAT I FIND AS MOST HELPFUL IS MEDITATION
trainval/1l4B16s5i78/50002 FOR ME I AM A PLANNER BY NATURE
trainval/1l4B16s5i78/50003 CHECK IT OFF
trainval/1l4B16s5i78/50004 BUT IT IS THE CHOICE THAT YOU MUST MAKE
trainval/1l4B16s5i78/50005 IT'S ABOUT TIME TO FULLY LIVE YOUR LIFE
trainval/1l4B16s5i78/50006 THE FEAR ALONE CAN BE PARALYZING
trainval/1LSE7KCN9xg/50001 IT'S JUST A FACT OF LIFE
trainval/1LSE7KCN9xg/50002 SO MAYBE CREATING AN IMPACT CRATER IN THIS REGION IS A LOT LIKE MAKING A FOOTPRINT IN THE COLORADO SNOW
trainval/1lUAhRSACKQ/50001 MY DEPRESSION CAME AS A RESULT OF NOT BEING READY FOR THE REALITIES OF MIDDLE SCHOOL
trainval/1lUAhRSACKQ/50002 EVERY SINGLE DAY I RETURNED TO SCHOOL TO A PLACE THAT HAD FOSTERED SUCH
trainval/1lUAhRSACKQ/50003 MY BED BECAME MY HIDING PLACE FROM THE WORLD
trainval/1lUAhRSACKQ/50004 I LOOKED PAST THE JEALOUSIES OF LIFE AND STARTED LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE AND TOWARD WAYS THAT I
trainval/1lUAhRSACKQ/50005 OUR MINDS ARE POWERFUL THINGS BECAUSE THEY INFLUENCE OUR THOUGHTS
trainval/1lUAhRSACKQ/50006 MY EXPERIENCE WITH DEPRESSION HAS TAUGHT ME SO MUCH IN TERMS OF HANDLING FUTURE SCENARIOS
trainval/1mUDw0sRZV0/50001 WE MADE AGLOE NEW YORK UP
trainval/1mUDw0sRZV0/50002 IT IS A FAKE PLACE
trainval/1mUDw0sRZV0/50003 IT'S A PAPER TOWN
trainval/1mUDw0sRZV0/50004 WE'RE GOING TO SUE YOUR PANTS OFF
trainval/1mUDw0sRZV0/50005 THE WAY THAT WE CHOOSE TO SORT OF OUR PERSONAL CARTOGRAPHIC ENTERPRISE ALSO SHAPES THE
trainval/1mUDw0sRZV0/50006 I BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE MAP CHANGES THE LIFE WE LEAD
trainval/1mUDw0sRZV0/50007 THEY LITERALLY PUT NOOSES ON THEMSELVES AND THEN THEY WENT OFF TO THEIR JOBS WHATEVER THEY WERE
trainval/1mUDw0sRZV0/50008 WHY WOULD I WANT TO JUMP OVER ALL THESE HURDLES AND HAVE THAT BE THE END
trainval/1mUDw0sRZV0/50009 IT'S ABOUT CARTOGRAPHY
trainval/1mUDw0sRZV0/50010 WHAT IS THE PROCESS OF CARTOGRAPHY
trainval/1mUDw0sRZV0/50011 AND THAT'S WHEN LEARNING REALLY BEGAN FOR ME
trainval/1mUDw0sRZV0/50012 IT'S TRUE THAT I HAD TEACHERS THAT DIDN'T GIVE UP ON ME AND I WAS VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE THOSE TEACHERS BECAUSE I OFTEN GAVE
trainval/1mUDw0sRZV0/50013 AND I SAID I DON'T KNOW LIKE SIX HOURS
trainval/1mUDw0sRZV0/50014 IT WAS SPOTTY IT WAS INCONSISTENT THERE WAS A LOT I DIDN'T KNOW
trainval/1mUDw0sRZV0/50016 HERE'S ZE TALKING ABOUT LAS VEGAS
trainval/1mUDw0sRZV0/50017 SO I HAD ONE LEARNING COMMUNITY IN HIGH SCHOOL THEN I WENT TO ANOTHER FOR COLLEGE AND THEN I WENT TO ANOTHER WHEN I
trainval/1mUDw0sRZV0/50018 TODAY'S QUESTION IS WHY
trainval/1mUDw0sRZV0/50019 THEY ALL HAVE MORE THAN HALF A MILLION VIEWS ON YOUTUBE
trainval/1N6e0DnGq38/50001 JUST WHAT IS TRADITIONAL FOOD ANYWAY
trainval/1N6e0DnGq38/50002 WHAT CLASSIFIES AS PRE CONTACT
trainval/1N6e0DnGq38/50003 FOR FARMING TRIBES THERE WERE THE THREE SISTERS
trainval/1N6e0DnGq38/50004 THE GOAL IS TO GET NATIVE AND HOPEFULLY NON NATIVE PEOPLE EXCITED ABOUT FOOD SOVEREIGNTY AND
trainval/1N6e0DnGq38/50005 IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARD AFTER ALL PALEO DIETS ARE ALREADY POPULAR AMONG EVERYONE FROM CROSSFIT BROS TO
trainval/1N6e0DnGq38/50006 PRE CONTACT EATING IS JUST LOCAVORE PALEO ANYONE CAN DO IT
trainval/1N6e0DnGq38/50007 IT'S NO SECRET THAT YOUR BODY FARES BETTER WHEN YOU AVOID PROCESSED FOODS
trainval/1NG7FoC5XRo/50001 SO RESEARCH IN MY LAB IS NOW ADDRESSING THIS GAP
trainval/1NG7FoC5XRo/50002 WITH THIS INFORMATION WE CAN EXPAND OUR ASSESSMENT METHODS TO OTHER CONDITIONS THAT CAN INTERFERE WITH ENTRAINMENT
trainval/1NG7FoC5XRo/50003 I LEFT CLINICAL PRACTICE AND WENT INTO RESEARCH TO SEARCH FOR ANSWERS
trainval/1O2l1dcSohA/50001 IF WE LOOK AT IT GOING INTO THE FUTURE IF IT CONTINUES AT THE RATE THAT IT HAS BEEN GOING WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DECADES
trainval/1O2l1dcSohA/50002 I'D LIKE TO TRY AND GIVE YOU THE INTUITION AS TO WHY THESE SYSTEMS MIGHT BE DANGEROUS
trainval/1O2l1dcSohA/50003 BASED ON ITS GOAL BEING UNPLUGGED IS TOTALLY ELIMINATING ALL THE FUTURE GAMES OF CHESS THAT IT MIGHT PLAY SO
trainval/1O2l1dcSohA/50004 THE SECOND CRITERION IS THAT WE WANT THESE SYSTEMS TO INTEGRATE WITH HUMAN SOCIETY AND WITH HUMANS IN A WAY THAT
trainval/1O2l1dcSohA/50005 SO WE NEED A WORLDWIDE SAFETY NETWORK IN A WAY
trainval/1O2l1dcSohA/50006 WE MIGHT REQUIRE THAT IT SHUT ITSELF DOWN IN VERY WELL SPECIFIED SITUATIONS
trainval/1o9NEtA2IEQ/50001 IT FLOODED IN A WAY THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN IT NORMALLY DOES
trainval/1oNlTrLIjU4/50001 THE MYTHS ABOUT THE HYMEN HAVE LIVED ON FOR CENTURIES BECAUSE THEY HAVE CULTURAL
trainval/1oNlTrLIjU4/50002 IN OTHER WORDS HYMENS NATURALLY VARY A LOT IN LOOKS AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES
trainval/1oNlTrLIjU4/50003 BUT IT MAY LOOK A BIT DIFFERENT FROM BEFORE
trainval/1oNlTrLIjU4/50004 THIS WAS NOTED OVER 100 YEARS AGO IN 1906 BY THE NORWEGIAN DOCTOR MARIE
trainval/1oNlTrLIjU4/50005 BUT WE MUST TRY
trainval/1oNlTrLIjU4/50006 WHEN DOCTORS EXAMINED THEIR HYMENS THEY COULD ONLY FIND CLEAR SIGNS OF PENETRATION
trainval/1pq5jnM1CSA/50001 TODAY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ONE OF THE BIGGEST MODERN DAY CHOOSING PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE WHICH IS THE CHOICE OVERLOAD
trainval/1pq5jnM1CSA/50002 WHO ARE THEY ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO BE INFORMING
trainval/1PV7HyS8fhA/50001 WHERE RIGHT NEXT DOOR THERE'S A CRACK HOUSE AND I SEE PEOPLE GETTING HIGH ON THE
trainval/1PV7HyS8fhA/50002 SO THAT'S WHAT I DID
trainval/1PV7HyS8fhA/50003 BUT WHEN WE TAKE ACTION IN DIRECT OPPOSITION FROM OUR FEAR SOMETHING AMAZING HAPPENS
trainval/1PV7HyS8fhA/50004 YOU MUST REPROGRAM YOUR BRAIN WITH DIFFERENT THOUGHTS
trainval/1PV7HyS8fhA/50005 FIRST I CREATED MY WEBSITE WITH ALL THE COOL DIFFERENT SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING AND MATH VIDEOS
trainval/1PV7HyS8fhA/50006 WELL OUR BRAINS ARE THE EXACT SAME WAY
trainval/1PV7HyS8fhA/50007 WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS TAKE THE VIRUS OUT WHICH IS CALLED FEAR
trainval/1QQ3gWmd20s/50001 AN LED DRESS WITH 4400 LEDS THAT I CONTROL WITH MY GLOVE
trainval/1QX7aoxSTAQ/50002 SO WE CANNOT STAY HERE IT'S DANGEROUS
trainval/1QX7aoxSTAQ/50003 HE TOLD ME HE'S AT SCHOOL
trainval/1QX7aoxSTAQ/50004 HE'D DOING QUITE WELL
trainval/1QX7aoxSTAQ/50005 I THOUGHT HOW MUCH MONEY DO I HAVE IN MY POCKET
trainval/1QX7aoxSTAQ/50006 IT'S GOOD FOR EVERYBODY
trainval/1QX7aoxSTAQ/50007 I SAID NO YOU CAN IMAGINE
trainval/1QX7aoxSTAQ/50008 I SAID NO NO NO NO WE CAN'T
trainval/1QX7aoxSTAQ/50009 AND THEN I ASKED THE USUAL QUESTION IS IT A PRIORITY
trainval/1QX7aoxSTAQ/50010 THAT WAS MY STORY
trainval/1rTEOU67zCo/50001 SHE CAN GO TO THE THEATER OR NOT JUST AS SHE WISHES
trainval/1rTEOU67zCo/50002 THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHILE NORA IS UNRESTRICTED WHILE SHE'S NOT INTERFERED WITH IN THE
trainval/1rTEOU67zCo/50003 A DOMINOS AS IT USED TO BE CALLED SHE IS DOMINATED IN THAT SENSE OR SUBORDINATED OR SUBJECTED
trainval/1rTEOU67zCo/50004 SO FOR EXAMPLE OF COURSE IT ARISES IN THE HOME
trainval/1rTEOU67zCo/50005 EVEN IF THE BULLYING DOESN'T OCCUR
trainval/1rTEOU67zCo/50006 IF THE CHILD'S SO TO SPEAK HAS TO RUN THE GAUNTLET THE THREAT OF SUCH BULLYING THAT CHILD'S NOT FREE
trainval/1rTEOU67zCo/50007 YOU'VE GOT TO SHARE EQUALLY IN CONTROLLING THAT LAW
trainval/1rTEOU67zCo/50008 IT'S DEPENDENT ON THE WILL OF THE AUTOCRAT
trainval/1rTEOU67zCo/50009 SAME IS TRUE IF AN ELITE CONTROLS THE GOVERNMENT
trainval/1rTEOU67zCo/50010 AND THAT ACTUALLY IS PROBABLY THE MAIN THEME IN THE COMPLAINTS OF THE AMERICANS IN THE LAST
trainval/1rTEOU67zCo/50011 AND IN ORDER TO INTRODUCE IT LET ME TALK ABOUT A PLAY THAT MANY OF YOU WILL KNOW IT'S A
trainval/1rTEOU67zCo/50012 AND WHILE YOU'RE UNDER THE WILL OF ANOTHER A COUNTRY IN THIS CASE UNDER THE WILL OF ANOTHER COUNTRY YOU CAN'T BE
trainval/1rTEOU67zCo/50013 SECOND THING WE NEED APART FROM PROTECTION OF MINORITIES WE ALSO NEED THE PROTECTION OF MAJORITIES
trainval/1rTEOU67zCo/50014 THIS WE OFTEN ACHIEVE THOUGH OUR NGOS WHICH HAVE SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART IN OUR CIVIC LIFE
trainval/1rTEOU67zCo/50015 THE PRICE OF LIBERTY AS IT USED TO BE SAID IS ETERNAL VIGILANCE
trainval/1rTEOU67zCo/50017 AND THAT'S THE FOLLOWING
trainval/1rTEOU67zCo/50018 I'M IN THIS CORNER OF SOCIETY THE GOVERNMENT ALWAYS STRIKES AT US
trainval/1rTEOU67zCo/50019 PUBLIC FREEDOM THAT I'VE JUST BEEN TALKING ABOUT MEANS FREEDOM MEANS CONTROL MEANS
trainval/1rTEOU67zCo/50020 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/1rTEOU67zCo/50021 WELL OF COURSE WE NEED AN ELECTORAL DEMOCRACY
trainval/1rTEOU67zCo/50022 I THINK THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING BUT WE NEED MORE THAN THAT TOO
trainval/1rTEOU67zCo/50023 WE NEED THREE THINGS AT LEAST BEYOND THAT
trainval/1rTEOU67zCo/50024 AN INSTANCE OF THAT FOR EXAMPLE IS THE LAW IS REPRESENTED IN THE POLICE
trainval/1S9RVl1dSl4/50001 A LOT OF THINGS ARE GOING THROUGH YOUR HEAD
trainval/1S9RVl1dSl4/50003 FOR ME IT WAS MOSTLY OUTRAGE
trainval/1S9RVl1dSl4/50004 I DON'T THINK WE QUITE WON THIS WAR YET AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE HERE WILL QUESTION THAT
trainval/1S9RVl1dSl4/50005 SO THE BEST THING THAT HAPPENED TO US SO FAR IN THE MEDICAL ARENA IN CANCER RESEARCH IS THE FACT THAT THE
trainval/1S9RVl1dSl4/50006 AND NOT JUST ANY TYPE OF BRAIN CANCER HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ONE OF THE MOST DEADLY FORMS OF BRAIN CANCER
trainval/1S9RVl1dSl4/50007 I TOOK OUT EVERYTHING
trainval/1sE96vd8W40/50001 THAT WAS UNTIL HE GOT A PUPPY
trainval/1sE96vd8W40/50002 I EVEN COME UP WITH AN EQUATION FOR THIS JUST TO TELL HOW AWESOME THEY ARE
trainval/1sE96vd8W40/50003 IF WE WANT TO DIG DEEPER INTO THAT 90 LET'S REMOVE THE 10 FOR A SECOND YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR DOG'S GENES IF YOU WENT AND ADOPTED YOUR
trainval/1sE96vd8W40/50004 SO WHAT'S IN THAT 90
trainval/1sE96vd8W40/50005 I KNEW I NEEDED TO DO EVERYTHING I COULD IN MY POWER TO FIGURE OUT HOW AND WHY THIS
trainval/1sE96vd8W40/50006 SO I SETTLED ON A WORLDWIDE JOURNEY TRAVELING AROUND THE WORLD LOOKING FOR ANSWERS
trainval/1sE96vd8W40/50007 AND TODAY I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU MY JOURNEY
trainval/1sE96vd8W40/50008 FOR ME IT SEEMED PRETTY EVIDENT WHERE I WAS GOING TO GO
trainval/1sE96vd8W40/50009 I WENT TO WHERE ONE OF THE OLDEST DOGS IN THE WORLD WAS EATING
trainval/1sE96vd8W40/50011 HE TOLD ME THAT THERE WERE A COUPLE OF FACTORS HERE WHEN HE WAS FEEDING MAGGIE
trainval/1sE96vd8W40/50012 SO WHEN IT CAME TO HER DIET PLEASE SHARE WITH ME
trainval/1sE96vd8W40/50013 SO I GOT IN CONTACT WITH THOMAS
trainval/1sE96vd8W40/50014 HE SAID SOME DAYS THE DOG WOULDN'T EAT
trainval/1sE96vd8W40/50015 THOMAS SAID YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/1sE96vd8W40/50016 WHAT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANT IS THAT WE SEE A LOWER INCIDENCE OF CANCER IN THESE ANIMALS
trainval/1sE96vd8W40/50017 SHE WAS SELF FASTING
trainval/1sE96vd8W40/50018 AND THEY WANT TO GIVE THEM A SECOND CHANCE
trainval/1sE96vd8W40/50019 SOME PEOPLE MAY SAY I DON'T KNOW THAT WAS VERY CONFUSING I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO ALL THAT
trainval/1sE96vd8W40/50020 AND HE LAUGHED AT ME
trainval/1sgb2cUqFiY/50001 HOWEVER NINE OUT OF TEN PEOPLE BREATHE THIS WAY
trainval/1sgb2cUqFiY/50002 TAKE YOUR HANDS
trainval/1sgb2cUqFiY/50003 PUT THEM THERE
trainval/1sgb2cUqFiY/50004 COME UP FROM THE BACK OF YOUR SEAT
trainval/1sgb2cUqFiY/50005 THE VAGUS NERVE IS A NERVE THAT GOES TO THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD AND GOES THROUGHOUT YOUR WHOLE BODY
trainval/1sgb2cUqFiY/50006 IT WAS TIME FOR A CHANGE
trainval/1sgb2cUqFiY/50007 I STARTED BY SIGNING UP FOR A YOGA CLASS WHERE WE WOULD DO BREATHING EXERCISES AT THE BEGINNING OF CLASS
trainval/1sgb2cUqFiY/50008 WE WOULD BREATHE THROUGH ONE NOSTRIL THEN THE OTHER WE WOULD DO BREATH HOLDS
trainval/1sgb2cUqFiY/50009 I WAS INTRIGUED
trainval/1sgb2cUqFiY/50011 WHAT WAS MOST ALARMING TO ME WAS WHEN I LOOKED AROUND ALMOST EVERYONE I KNEW
trainval/1sgb2cUqFiY/50012 NOW WHO DO YOU THINK WERE THE FIRST PEOPLE THAT CALLED ME
trainval/1sgb2cUqFiY/50013 WAS IT MEMBERS OF THE WELLNESS COMMUNITY
trainval/1sgb2cUqFiY/50014 WE KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF THE BREATH
trainval/1sgb2cUqFiY/50015 ANCIENT YOGIS SAY WE COME INTO THIS WORLD WITH A CERTAIN NUMBER OF BREATHS AND WE CAN TAKE THEM
trainval/1sgb2cUqFiY/50016 SO I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING
trainval/1sgb2cUqFiY/50017 I'M BREATHING WRONG
trainval/1sgb2cUqFiY/50018 HOW COULD THIS BE
trainval/1sgb2cUqFiY/50019 AND IT HAPPENS BECAUSE OF SEVERAL THINGS
trainval/1sgb2cUqFiY/50020 NOW MUCH OF THE CONFUSION AROUND BREATHING OCCURS BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE DIAPHRAGM
trainval/1sgb2cUqFiY/50021 BECAUSE I'M SEEING IT
trainval/1sgb2cUqFiY/50022 SO I WANT YOU TO TIP FORWARD INHALE LET YOUR BELLY GO
trainval/1sgb2cUqFiY/50023 IT COMES FROM THE MILITARY
trainval/1sgb2cUqFiY/50024 IT'S MY FAVORITE ONE
trainval/1SnQ27ZxS8A/50001 WHAT A BEAUTIFUL WORLD THAT WOULD BE
trainval/1SPazvfN9EU/50001 THEY BROUGHT HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN
trainval/1SPazvfN9EU/50002 BUT WHAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING IS THAT THE REALLY SUCCESSFUL GROUPS WERE NOT THE ONES THAT HAD ONE OR TWO PEOPLE
trainval/1SPazvfN9EU/50003 THERE WERE NO PASSENGERS AND NEITHER DID ANYONE DOMINATE EVERYBODY CONTRIBUTED FULLY
trainval/1SPazvfN9EU/50004 THAT THE BONDS OF SOCIAL SENSITIVITY MUTUAL SUPPORT LOYALTY AND TRUST MAKE A
trainval/1SPazvfN9EU/50005 THEY WERE COMMISSIONED TO BUILD THE EQUESTRIAN CENTER FOR THE BEIJING OLYMPICS
trainval/1SPazvfN9EU/50006 THE BUILDING HAD TO RECEIVE 2500 HIGHLY STRUNG RATHER NEUROTIC
trainval/1SPazvfN9EU/50007 AND IT WAS ONLY REALLY WHEN WE STOPPED WORKING AND WE SPENT TIME INVESTED
trainval/1SPazvfN9EU/50008 COMPANIES DON'T HAVE IDEAS ONLY PEOPLE DO
trainval/1SPazvfN9EU/50009 HELPFULNESS IS WHY THE FIRM SAP THINKS THEY CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTION IN 17 MINUTES
trainval/1SPazvfN9EU/50010 AND LOGOS AND MISSION STATEMENTS DON'T MOTIVATE ANYBODY
trainval/1SPazvfN9EU/50011 THE TERM DERIVES FROM A SOCIOLOGIST WHO STUDIED COMMUNITIES AND IDENTIFIED WHY WAS IT THAT SOME
trainval/1SPazvfN9EU/50012 INSTEAD IT'S A BIT LIKE A BABY
trainval/1SPazvfN9EU/50013 AND WHEN I VISITED FIRMS RENOWNED FOR THEIR INGENUITY AND CREATIVITY I COULDN'T EVEN SEE THE
trainval/1SPazvfN9EU/50014 MOTIVATING PEOPLE BY MONEY HAS TO GO TOO
trainval/1SPazvfN9EU/50015 EVERYBODY HAS A VALID PERSPECTIVE
trainval/1SPazvfN9EU/50016 AND WE WON'T SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE BY WAITING FOR INDIVIDUAL SUPERMEN OR
trainval/1SPazvfN9EU/50017 NOW WE NEED EVERYBODY
trainval/1SPazvfN9EU/50018 IT WAS A BILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS
trainval/1SPazvfN9EU/50019 FRANK MASLIN THE HEAD OF ENGINEERING SAID THERE WILL BE NO STARS ON THIS TEAM
trainval/1SS2wOnkcSk/50001 WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE THIS OUT BECAUSE WE NOW LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE EXTREMISTS GUIDED BY THEIR MORAL
trainval/1SS2wOnkcSk/50002 SO TAKING THIS IDEA FURTHER MY COLLEAGUES ALSO LOOKED AT WHETHER SEROTONIN LEVELS INFLUENCE THE WAY THAT WE RESPOND
trainval/1SS2wOnkcSk/50003 THOSE WHO READ THE ARTICLE ABOUT CHANGEABLE GROUPS WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE WILLING TO MEET WITH THE OTHER SIDE
trainval/1SS2wOnkcSk/50004 BUT I DO THINK IT'S PLAUSIBLE THAT ONE DAY WE WILL HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENT BRAIN
trainval/1Totz8aa2Gg/50001 TED IS FAMOUS FOR KEEPING A VERY SHARP EYE ON THE CLOCK SO THEY'RE GOING TO HATE
trainval/1TYPldG99dk/50001 AND HOW MUCH I WANTED TO GO THERE SINCE I WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD
trainval/1TYPldG99dk/50002 AND AFTER READING THE THE ALCHEMIST I DECIDED TO BUY A PLANE TICKET TO ETHIOPIA
trainval/1TYPldG99dk/50003 THIS MIGHT SOUND CRAZY IT SOUNDS CRAZY TO ME
trainval/1TYPldG99dk/50004 IT' S A STORY ABOUT ALL OF US
trainval/1TYPldG99dk/50005 I'M GOING TO DO THIS
trainval/1TYPldG99dk/50006 I'M GOING TO FORCE MY WAY THROUGH THE AMAZON FOREST
trainval/1TYPldG99dk/50007 BUT ALSO YOU HAVE TO TAKE A STEP
trainval/1U2qMRGihGg/50001 DMITRY GERASHCHENKO FROM HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL
trainval/1U2qMRGihGg/50002 I'M GOING TO DEMO THIS SOUND FOR YOU RIGHT NOW
trainval/1U2qMRGihGg/50003 THAT SOUND PATTERN ACTUALLY PRIMES YOUR MIND TO HAVE MORE OF THESE REGENERATIVE DELTA WAVES
trainval/1VRgmKiE0Js/50001 NOW I DON'T THINK OLD TOM BRADY USES THE SAME KIND OF TOOL I USE WHICH ARE NUMBERS
trainval/1VRgmKiE0Js/50002 IF YOU WANTED TO UNDERSTAND REALLY THE SOURCES AND DRIVERS OF PROFITABILITY
trainval/1VRgmKiE0Js/50003 SHE SAID OKAY YOU'VE LEFT MICROSOFT
trainval/1VRgmKiE0Js/50004 SHE'D BEEN VERY BUSY WITH OUR PHILANTHROPIC STUFF OVER THE LAST SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS AND SHE SAID WHY DON'T YOU COME
trainval/1VRgmKiE0Js/50005 AND I SAID WELL YOU KNOW I'M JUST KIND OF KICKING BACK BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH
trainval/1VRgmKiE0Js/50006 BESIDES THE GOVERNMENT'S THE BEST PHILANTHROPY IT'S THE BIGGEST PHILANTHROPY IN THE WORLD
trainval/1VRgmKiE0Js/50007 I WAS HOPING I COULD FIND SOMETHING LIKE A 10 K DOCUMENT THAT THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
trainval/1VRgmKiE0Js/50008 WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE
trainval/1VRgmKiE0Js/50009 I ASK PEOPLE
trainval/1VRgmKiE0Js/50010 MAYBE EVEN IN THE WORST CASE IN SCHOOL NUMBERS WERE SOMETHING THAT YOU MEMORIZED FOR SOME PURPOSE SOME
trainval/1VRgmKiE0Js/50011 WHO BUILT THE ROAD IN FRONT OF YOUR HOUSE
trainval/1VRgmKiE0Js/50012 INFRASTRUCTURE EXPENDITURE IS MUCH IN THE PUBLIC EYE ACTUALLY WITH PRETTY
trainval/1VRgmKiE0Js/50013 TO TRY TO TRY OUT SOME OF THE IDEAS
trainval/1VRgmKiE0Js/50014 FEDERAL INCOME TAX
trainval/1VRgmKiE0Js/50015 WE'RE A LITTLE BAND BUT WE GET A LOT OF HELP IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS
trainval/1VRgmKiE0Js/50016 THAT'S A QUESTION BY THE NUMBERS YOU CAN ANSWER THAT IS AN OUTCOME
trainval/1VRgmKiE0Js/50017 WE DON'T WANT THIS PRIVATE SHADOW SOMEBODY WILL WORRY ABOUT THE SOURCE BEING A D OR AN R OR A BLAH
trainval/1VRgmKiE0Js/50018 AND THAT'S JUST AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL
trainval/1VRgmKiE0Js/50019 I DIDN'T KNOW WHEN I STARTED THIS
trainval/1VRgmKiE0Js/50020 THERE'S OVER 90000 INDEPENDENT GOVERNMENT JURISDICTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES
trainval/1VRgmKiE0Js/50021 WHAT ABOUT PHILANTHROPY AND CIVIC ACTIVISM AS OPPOSED TO RUNNING A BASKETBALL TEAM AND PAYING TAXES
trainval/1VRgmKiE0Js/50022 THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH
trainval/1X7fZoDs9KU/50001 OH SURE WE'RE VERY GOOD AT EMPATHY WHEN IT'S A QUESTION OF DEALING WITH PEOPLE WHO KIND OF LOOK LIKE US AND KIND OF WALK AND
trainval/1X7fZoDs9KU/50002 I SWEAR THAT AS I GET OLDER MY IDEAS BECOME SIMPLER AND MORE AND MORE CHILDISH
trainval/1X7fZoDs9KU/50003 SO MY COLLEAGUE DR
trainval/1X7fZoDs9KU/50004 ROBERT GOVERS AND I HAVE SPENT THE BEST PART OF THE LAST TWO YEARS WITH THE HELP OF A LARGE NUMBER OF VERY SERIOUS AND CLEVER PEOPLE
trainval/1X7fZoDs9KU/50005 WHY DID I DO THIS
trainval/1xgCI05l2GA/50001 IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE OF THE SORT OF WORKS THEY WERE DOING IN LIFE
trainval/1xgCI05l2GA/50004 THAT GRAVE DATES TO AROUND 450 AD
trainval/1XL8I9SIqRY/50001 HE TOLD ME THAT HE DIDN'T WANT ME TO LEAVE FEELING DISAPPOINTED DUE TO SOME OF WHAT I
trainval/1XL8I9SIqRY/50002 AND THEN I WOULD TELL THEM ABOUT MALAKWANG A FANCY VEGETABLE DISH FROM MY
trainval/1XL8I9SIqRY/50003 IT MAKES FOR A BETTER MEAL
trainval/1YO1FmVAPrA/50001 LIFE WAS REALLY STARTING TO TURN AROUND
trainval/1YO1FmVAPrA/50002 BUT ABOUT A MONTH INTO THIS NEW LIFE I REALIZED SOMETHING WAS MISSING
trainval/1YO1FmVAPrA/50003 I HAD TO KEEP GOING
trainval/1YO1FmVAPrA/50004 PROPS ARE ALSO REALLY GOOD AT PROVIDING AN ENTRY POINT FOR CONVERSATION
trainval/1YO1FmVAPrA/50005 I ONCE BROUGHT A GOLDFISH OUT WITH ME
trainval/1YO1FmVAPrA/50006 I SAT IT ON THE BAR AND I ORDERED A SCOTCH AND THAT GOLDFISH WAS THE BEST WINGMAN
trainval/1YO1FmVAPrA/50007 PEOPLE COULD NOT HELP THEMSELVES THEY HAD TO COME UP AND TALK TO ME
trainval/1YO1FmVAPrA/50008 THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT I REALIZED THE RIPPLE EFFECT OF THE PROJECT
trainval/1YO1FmVAPrA/50009 I SPENT A COUPLE OF HOURS JUST LISTENING TO BRETT AS HE TOLD ONE HORRIFIC STORY AFTER ANOTHER
trainval/1YO1FmVAPrA/50010 AND WITH EACH STORY I COULD TELL THAT HE WAS GETTING LIGHTER AND I WAS GETTING HEAVIER WITH THIS EMOTIONAL
trainval/1YO1FmVAPrA/50011 I LANDED A DREAM JOB I FOUND A GREAT APARTMENT
trainval/1YO1FmVAPrA/50012 AND AS TIME GOES ON RELATIONSHIPS OR CONNECTIONS BECOME MORE IMPORTANT
trainval/1YO1FmVAPrA/50013 THE STUDY FOUND STRONG SUPPORT FOR GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH THAT HAS LINKED SOCIAL TIES WITH LONGEVITY
trainval/1YO1FmVAPrA/50014 THE FRIEND A DAY PROJECT CAUSED ME TO DO THINGS I'VE NEVER WOULD HAVE DONE OTHERWISE
trainval/1YO1FmVAPrA/50015 BUT NOW IMAGINE YOU'RE ON AN ISLAND WITH FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE
trainval/1YO1FmVAPrA/50016 YOU NOW HAVE FOUR HUNDRED DATA POINTS
trainval/1yVdhRyTxaM/50001 HE JUST COULDN'T CAPTURE THE PICTURE
trainval/1yVdhRyTxaM/50002 BUT EVERY OTHER MEDIUM DOES IT
trainval/1yVdhRyTxaM/50003 THE SHIPS START IN ENGLAND THEY COME DOWN FROM ENGLAND THEY GO TO AFRICA THEY GO ACROSS THE OCEAN THAT'S THE MIDDLE PASSAGE PART THEY COME TO AMERICA
trainval/1yVdhRyTxaM/50004 IT'S AN EXPRESSION OF LOVE
trainval/1Yz7Snu6pnI/50001 HOWEVER AFTER FIVE DECADES OF RESEARCH THERE'S NO STRONG CONSENSUS ON THE
trainval/1Yz7Snu6pnI/50002 AS MOST COMMONLY DEFINED BY PSYCHOLOGISTS PMS INVOLVES NEGATIVE BEHAVIORAL
trainval/1Yz7Snu6pnI/50003 WE KNOW THERE'S A STRONG CULTURAL COMPONENT TO THE BELIEF IN PMS BECAUSE IT'S NEARLY UNHEARD OF OUTSIDE OF
trainval/1Yz7Snu6pnI/50004 THERE'S A GENERAL ASSUMPTION THAT FLUCTUATIONS IN REPRODUCTIVE HORMONES CAUSE EXTREME
trainval/1Yz7Snu6pnI/50005 AND FINALLY THE DSM REQUIRED THAT THE EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE SHOULD BE MORE THAN SIMPLY AN
trainval/1Yz7Snu6pnI/50006 WE NOW HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF SYMPTOMS AND A HIGH IMPACT ON FUNCTIONING THAT'S REQUIRED
trainval/1Yz7Snu6pnI/50007 LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I MEAN BY ERRONEOUSLY
trainval/1Yz7Snu6pnI/50008 WELL I CAN TELL YOU THAT TREATING PMS HAS BECOME A PROFITABLE THRIVING INDUSTRY
trainval/1Yz7Snu6pnI/50009 SO WE HAVE NOT HAD THAT AT ALL WITH THESE SO CALLED TREATMENTS
trainval/1Yz7Snu6pnI/50010 HOWEVER THE FINANCIAL GAIN OF PERPETUATING THE MYTH THAT PMS IS A COMMON
trainval/1Yz7Snu6pnI/50011 WHEN WOMEN ARE PRESCRIBED DRUGS LIKE ANTI DEPRESSANTS OR HORMONES MEDICAL PROTOCOL REQUIRES THAT
trainval/1Yz7Snu6pnI/50012 PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES REAP UNTOLD PROFITS WHEN WOMEN ARE CONVINCED THEY SHOULD TAKE A PRESCRIBED
trainval/1Yz7Snu6pnI/50013 IN 2013 MIDOL TOOK IN 48 MILLION DOLLARS IN SALES REVENUE
trainval/1Yz7Snu6pnI/50014 THE MEDICAL FIELD HAS A LONG HISTORY OF CONCEPTUALIZING WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE PROCESSES AS
trainval/1Yz7Snu6pnI/50015 OH THAT'S NOT WHO SHE IS
trainval/1Yz7Snu6pnI/50016 IT'S OUT OF HER CONTROL
trainval/1z3Fgtj8fqk/50001 WE HAVE 30 EMPLOYEES AND MANUFACTURE A VARIETY OF PLASTIC PARTS
trainval/1z3Fgtj8fqk/50002 WE HAVE TO CAPTURE THAT KNOWLEDGE AND HELP THESE RETIRING WORKERS TO PASS IT ON TO THE NEXT
trainval/1z3Fgtj8fqk/50003 WITH CTE STUDENTS STUDY CAREERS IN INDUSTRY AND BUSINESS AND CONNECT WITH PEOPLE IN THOSE
trainval/1z3Fgtj8fqk/50004 SOME ARE JUST LIKE I WAS
trainval/1ZQmwVYNgPc/50001 SO I CUT A FEW SLICES OFF A LOAF OF BREAD I PUT THEM ONTO A PLATE AND THEN I PUT THEM RIGHT INTO THE
trainval/1ZQmwVYNgPc/50002 THAT'S THE WAY I LIKE MY TOAST
trainval/1ZQmwVYNgPc/50003 I HONESTLY HATE MY EYE COLOUR IT LOOKS LIKE CAT PEE
trainval/1ZQmwVYNgPc/50004 BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF MY FRIENDS WHO'D KILL FOR IT
trainval/1ZQmwVYNgPc/50005 YOU HAVE TO EMBRACE WHO YOU ARE AND EMBRACE WHO OTHERS ARE
trainval/1ZQmwVYNgPc/50006 DON'T LOOK AT THE NEGATIVE IN SOMEONE AND LOOK AT THE POSITIVE
trainval/1ZQmwVYNgPc/50007 IT TAKES MORE ENERGY TO HATE THAN TO LOVE
trainval/20adDr7Felw/50001 WE CAN PAY THEM OFF OVER A DAILY OR A WEEKLY SCHEDULE
trainval/20adDr7Felw/50002 WE NEED TO DO MORE OF THE THINGS WE IN AFRICA WANT TO DO WITH THE APPLIANCE SET
trainval/20adDr7Felw/50004 IN MY MIND THIS MIGHT BE THE BIGGEST LEAPFROG OF THEM ALL
trainval/20DZsCdCuOg/50001 GRANDMA INSTILLED IN MY MOTHER THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION
trainval/20DZsCdCuOg/50002 UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER THAT WAS NOT THE CASE FOR MR
trainval/20DZsCdCuOg/50003 MY CALL TO ACTION FOR YOU TODAY IS THAT YOU TAKE THE TIME AND INVEST IN TRANSITIONAL HOUSING FOR ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE SEGMENTS OF OUR
trainval/21jSOCNLuYg/50001 AND I TRIED TO LEARN I TRIED TO STUDY
trainval/21jSOCNLuYg/50002 I'M THE NUMBER ONE
trainval/21jSOCNLuYg/50003 SO I JUST WANT TO COME BACK TO NORMAL
trainval/23FRUuLcQ6A/50001 IT WAS ONLY IN 1952 WHEN THE HERSHEY CHASE EXPERIMENT CONFIRMED THAT DNA WAS A MOLECULE THAT
trainval/23FRUuLcQ6A/50002 AS I SPEAK THE BIOTECH COMPANY BIOVIVA IS CONDUCTING THE FIRST HUMAN
trainval/23FRUuLcQ6A/50003 DINOSAUR CLONES WOULD BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND THIS CHANGE IN OXYGEN CONTENT WITHOUT SUFFERING OXYGEN
trainval/23FRUuLcQ6A/50004 BECAUSE OF THIS WE ARE PRIVILEGED
trainval/23Uuehgmd14/50001 AND SO WE SHOULD
trainval/23Uuehgmd14/50002 ARE THERE MEN AROUND THAT TABLE
trainval/23Uuehgmd14/50003 ARE THERE MOMS WHO'VE RAISED BOYS AROUND THAT TABLE
trainval/23Uuehgmd14/50004 AND THEY SAY THESE THINGS AS IF IT'S OK
trainval/23vKtqo2t4k/50001 SO WE CANNOT STAY HERE IT'S DANGEROUS
trainval/23vKtqo2t4k/50002 I THOUGHT HOW MUCH MONEY DO I HAVE IN MY POCKET
trainval/23vKtqo2t4k/50003 BUT ALSO FOR THE NEWCOMERS
trainval/23vKtqo2t4k/50004 WE ARE GOING ON
trainval/23vKtqo2t4k/50005 IT' S GOOD FOR EVERYBODY
trainval/25onkAGt3Gs/50001 SO CONVENTIONAL ARCHITECTURE ELEMENTS THINGS THAT COME TO YOU EVERY TIME YOU HAVE A CLIENT AND THE BRIEF COMES IN
trainval/25onkAGt3Gs/50002 AND UNCLEAR OF COURSE
trainval/25onkAGt3Gs/50004 SO THEY ASKED US TO DO SOMETHING ON THIS SITE THERE WAS NO BRIEF
trainval/25onkAGt3Gs/50005 WHERE DO I PUT MY PIGS
trainval/25onkAGt3Gs/50006 SO WE ARE NOT IN A CITY AREA WE'RE NOT INSIDE A VILLAGE BUT WE ARE OUTSIDE ISOLATED
trainval/25onkAGt3Gs/50007 AS DESIGNERS WHAT WE CAN DO IS CREATE FLEXIBLE SPACES THAT CAN BE USED BOTH AS LIVING AND
trainval/25onkAGt3Gs/50008 ONLY IN A COMMUNITY YOU CAN SUPPORT AND SUSTAIN YOURSELF
trainval/25onkAGt3Gs/50009 WE ARE NOT THERE TO STAY
trainval/25onkAGt3Gs/50010 IT IS FOR THE 10 OF THE POPULATION OF THIS WORLD IT IS OUTDATED
trainval/267BlUBordQ/50001 IT DIDN'T WORK ALL THAT WELL
trainval/267BlUBordQ/50002 WE CAN REFUEL THIS VERY QUICKLY JUST BY PUTTING MORE FUEL INTO IT AND THE DEVICE IS UNCHANGED
trainval/289ZxBZdKvY/50001 BUT AS I GOT OLDER I STARTED NOTICING THINGS LIKE
trainval/289ZxBZdKvY/50002 HOW COME MY NEIGHBORHOOD FRIEND DON'T HAVE TO WAKE UP AT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND GO TO A SCHOOL THAT'S AN HOUR
trainval/289ZxBZdKvY/50003 THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF OTHER KIDS JUST LIKE ME WHO DESERVE THIS TOO
trainval/289ZxBZdKvY/50004 WHY DOESN'T EVERYONE GET THIS
trainval/289ZxBZdKvY/50005 ALL OF MY NEIGHBORHOOD FRIENDS WERE EXPERIENCING AN EDUCATIONAL TRAIN WRECK THAT I WAS
trainval/289ZxBZdKvY/50006 I AM THE DAUGHTER OF TWO HARDWORKING COLLEGE EDUCATED AFRICAN AMERICAN PARENTS WHO CHOSE
trainval/289ZxBZdKvY/50007 AND THEN I'D REPLY STRANGERS FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WANTED YOU TO HAVE THESE
trainval/289ZxBZdKvY/50008 WE KEEP FOCUSING ON THE END RESULTS OR TEST RESULTS AND GETTING FRUSTRATED
trainval/289ZxBZdKvY/50009 WE GET TO A CATASTROPHE AND WE WONDER HOW DID IT GET SO BAD
trainval/289ZxBZdKvY/50010 EQUAL AND EQUITABLE
trainval/289ZxBZdKvY/50011 WHAT IS AN ACTRESS WITH NO STAGE
trainval/289ZxBZdKvY/50012 WHAT IS A SCIENTIST WITH NO LABORATORY
trainval/28hGxw5DBK8/50001 I COULDN'T DO THAT ANYMORE
trainval/28hGxw5DBK8/50002 I HAD WONDERFUL PEOPLE IN MY LIFE WHO CAME
trainval/28hGxw5DBK8/50003 TODAY IS TODAY AND I'M GLAD IT'S TODAY
trainval/28hGxw5DBK8/50004 AND I CHOOSE AGAIN OFTEN
trainval/28hGxw5DBK8/50005 GO AHEAD AND ADJUST YOUR SAILS
trainval/28hGxw5DBK8/50006 SO I WAS REJECTED
trainval/28sa2zGgmwE/50001 AND SO IT BOTHERED ME
trainval/28sa2zGgmwE/50002 YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EXPERTS
trainval/28sa2zGgmwE/50003 WE KNOW OUR AIM
trainval/28sa2zGgmwE/50004 AND THEY JUST KEEP GOING THROUGH ALL THESE THINGS
trainval/28sa2zGgmwE/50005 YOU OWN THE KNOWLEDGE
trainval/28sa2zGgmwE/50006 YOU KNOW IT ALL
trainval/28sa2zGgmwE/50007 SHOW US LET US SIGN
trainval/28sa2zGgmwE/50009 IN THE FEW CASES WHERE THIS HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN AFRICA THERE HAS BEEN REMARKABLE SUCCESSES RECORDED
trainval/28sa2zGgmwE/50010 2 MILLION CASES
trainval/28sa2zGgmwE/50011 I AM CONVINCED THAT AFRICA'S FURTHER TRANSFORMATION AFRICA'S ADVANCEMENT RESTS
trainval/28sa2zGgmwE/50012 I ASKED HIM WHY
trainval/28sa2zGgmwE/50013 WE CAN DO IT
trainval/2a2724wcfcc/50001 BACK IN 2006 I DECIDED TO HAVE SOME FUN ONE DAY AND AS AN EXPERIMENT I RECORDED MYSELF PLAYING A
trainval/2a2724wcfcc/50002 MORE PEOPLE THAN HAD EVER SEEN ME PLAY IN ALL THE YEARS OF MY LIFE COMBINED
trainval/2a2724wcfcc/50003 HOW COULD I MAKE THEM FEEL LIKE THEY ARE IN THE SAME ROOM AS ME NOT JUST LISTENING BUT ACTIVELY CONTRIBUTING
trainval/2a2724wcfcc/50004 BY UTILIZING STREAMING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL MEDIA INTERACTIVITY I WAS ABLE TO CREATE A SPACE
trainval/2AZwSkHTkCU/50001 TELL ME WHAT ARE THEY WAITING FOR
trainval/2AZwSkHTkCU/50002 WE HAVE NOW HELD PEACE MASK PROJECT WORKSHOPS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING
trainval/2AZwSkHTkCU/50003 WE WITNESSED KILOMETER AFTER KILOMETER OF TOWNS AND VILLAGES FLATTENED ALONG THE
trainval/2BogtvaCWvI/50001 PROBABLY MALE AGAIN
trainval/2BogtvaCWvI/50002 IT IS HAPPENING ACROSS ALL SOCIAL MEDIA
trainval/2BOTS9GAjc4/50001 THAT'S ABOUT WHAT YOU'D EXPECT
trainval/2BOTS9GAjc4/50002 THEIR CONTRACEPTION RATE 29 PERCENT
trainval/2BOTS9GAjc4/50003 WOMEN IN AFRICA WILL TELL YOU OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT WHAT THEY PREFER TODAY IS AN INJECTABLE
trainval/2BOTS9GAjc4/50004 I HAD A PLAN FOR MY FUTURE
trainval/2BOTS9GAjc4/50005 I WANTED TO GO TO COLLEGE
trainval/2BOTS9GAjc4/50006 NOW INDIAN WOMEN WERE REALLY SMART IN THIS SITUATION
trainval/2BOTS9GAjc4/50007 WHEN THEY WENT TO GET AN IUD INSERTED THEY GOT PAID SIX RUPEES
trainval/2BOTS9GAjc4/50008 ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF ECONOMIC GROWTH ACROSS THAT REGION WAS THIS CULTURAL TREND
trainval/2BOTS9GAjc4/50009 SWEEPING CHANGES START AT THE INDIVIDUAL FAMILY LEVEL THE FAMILY MAKING A DECISION ABOUT
trainval/2BOTS9GAjc4/50010 AND WE NEED TO START NOW
trainval/2BOTS9GAjc4/50011 FAMILY SIZES ARE COMING DOWN NATURALLY ALL OVER THE WORLD
trainval/2BOTS9GAjc4/50012 AND I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT IT THOUGH FROM A DIFFERENT LENS
trainval/2BOTS9GAjc4/50013 WE NEED TO LOOK AT IT FROM THE GROUND UPWARDS
trainval/2BOTS9GAjc4/50014 WE LOOKED AT IT FROM TOP DOWN AND SAID WE WANT TO HAVE DIFFERENT POPULATION NUMBERS OVER TIME
trainval/2BOTS9GAjc4/50015 BUT THE CHOICES HAVE TO BE MADE AT THE FAMILY LEVEL
trainval/2BOTS9GAjc4/50017 JOIN THE CONVERSATION
trainval/2BOTS9GAjc4/50018 WE NEED A GROUNDSWELL OF PEOPLE SAYING THIS MAKES SENSE
trainval/2BOTS9GAjc4/50019 WE'VE GOT TO GIVE ALL WOMEN ACCESS NO MATTER WHERE THEY LIVE
trainval/2BOTS9GAjc4/50020 AND SO I HOPE THEY'LL FEEL THAT I'M LIVING OUT WHAT I'VE LEARNED FROM THEM AND FROM THE DECADES OF WORK THAT I'VE ALREADY
trainval/2Brajdazp1o/50001 AND THAT COULD HELP SLOW DOWN GLOBAL WARMING
trainval/2cU56SWXHFw/50001 STROOP TESTS HAVE BEEN DONE WITH METAPHOR AS WELL
trainval/2cYDyMnL4M8/50001 FORTY PERCENT OF THOSE PREPAID PHONES ARE RECHARGED AT LESS THAN 20 CENTS
trainval/2cYDyMnL4M8/50002 BUT TODAY DEMOCRACY HAS BECOME A BOTTOM UP PROCESS WHERE EVERYBODY HAS REALIZED THE BENEFITS OF
trainval/2cYDyMnL4M8/50003 AND THEREFORE DEMOCRACY HAS BECOME EMBEDDED
trainval/2cYDyMnL4M8/50004 BUT TODAY FINALLY AFTER ECONOMIC REFORMS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH I THINK THE NOTION THAT CITIES
trainval/2cYDyMnL4M8/50005 EVERY PROVINCE HAD ITS OWN MARKET FOR AGRICULTURE
trainval/2cYDyMnL4M8/50006 A LOT OF THE INDIAN PROBLEMS ARE RELATED TO THE IDEOLOGY OF CASTE AND OTHER THINGS
trainval/2cYDyMnL4M8/50007 THIS POLICY IS CAUSING GRIDLOCK
trainval/2dnSoGaEHxs/50001 WE WERE IN A ROOM WITH DOCTORS AND NURSES AND STAFF FROM JACOBI SOME OF OUR
trainval/2dnSoGaEHxs/50002 AND SHE SAID THAT THESE YOUNG WOMEN WERE NOT REALLY READY TO HAVE CHILDREN AND IN ADDITION TO THAT THEY
trainval/2dnSoGaEHxs/50003 WE STARTED TO WONDER ABOUT LULLABIES
trainval/2dnSoGaEHxs/50004 WE WONDERED WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF THESE YOUNG WOMEN WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COLLABORATE WITH ARTISTS
trainval/2dnSoGaEHxs/50005 LULLABY HAS EVOLVED AND NOW TAKES PLACE IN NUMEROUS HEALTHCARE SETTINGS
trainval/2dnSoGaEHxs/50006 AS LULLABY HAS EVOLVED IT'S ALSO BROADENED OUT AND THE FIRST LULLABY THAT YOU'LL HEAR IS CALLED
trainval/2dnSoGaEHxs/50007 HE WAS STAFFING A LULLABY PROJECT WORKING WITH SOME YOUNG WOMEN WHO WERE
trainval/2dnSoGaEHxs/50008 HOW DO WE SERVE PEOPLE THROUGH MUSIC
trainval/2dnSoGaEHxs/50009 WE BELIEVE THAT MUSIC IS A BIRTH RIGHT AND THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO EXTRAORDINARY MUSICAL
trainval/2dRlssVF7fc/50002 TOKENS COULD BE EXCHANGED FOR MENIAL LABOR
trainval/2dRlssVF7fc/50003 AND THIS IS VERY MUCH PART OF THE KIND OF UTOPIAN ETHOS TO SAIL AWAY
trainval/2dRlssVF7fc/50004 THERE WERE SOME ALLEGATIONS AS WELL AT THE TIME THE WIVES WERE TREATED AS PROPERTY THE WIVES OF THE WEALTHY
trainval/2FASIuDTMjE/50001 BUT BASICALLY YOU CAN TAKE A CELLPHONE OR A TABLET OR A HEADSET AND MOVE AROUND THREE DIMENSIONAL
trainval/2FMBSblpcrc/50001 12 ZODIAC SIGNS
trainval/2FMBSblpcrc/50002 IF WE COULD REDUCE THE USAGE OF PAPER TOWELS ONE PAPER TOWEL PER PERSON PER
trainval/2G0wQfUl9EU/50001 TODAY I BROUGHT TWO RECENT PROJECTS AS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS
trainval/2G0wQfUl9EU/50002 SO WE CREATED SOME BUDGET SAVINGS THAT WE USED TO IMPLEMENT THE PROJECT
trainval/2G0wQfUl9EU/50003 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/2G8C36aKnpU/50001 AND ONE AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE HAVE LIKED ME
trainval/2G8C36aKnpU/50003 I SAID WHAT IS IT
trainval/2G8C36aKnpU/50005 WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND
trainval/2G8C36aKnpU/50006 I'M ETCHED IN THEIR SOULS AS THEY ARE ETCHED IN MINE ON THIS LIFE LONG JOURNEY OF DISCOVERY AND COMMUNICATION
trainval/2g9GedPylM8/50001 I CAME ALONG THIS STUDY AND I GOT STUCK I COULD NOT LET GO OF IT UP TO THIS DAY
trainval/2g9GedPylM8/50002 31 OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ORIGINATE FROM OUR FOOD CONSUMPTION
trainval/2i0dGoh3VUg/50001 OVER THE YEARS I'VE REALIZED THAT THERE ARE THREE KEY ELEMENTS THAT BRING ABOUT CHANGE
trainval/2i0dGoh3VUg/50002 IF PEOPLE KNOW AND UNDERSTAND WHY AND HOW BUSINESS LEADERS MAKE DECISIONS IT IS EASIER
trainval/2i0dGoh3VUg/50003 HOW DO WE KEEP THEM APART
trainval/2i0dGoh3VUg/50004 AND WHEN DO WE COLLABORATE
trainval/2i0dGoh3VUg/50005 HOW TO CARE FOR THE WEAKEST IN THE COMMUNITY
trainval/2i0dGoh3VUg/50006 HOW WILL LATVIA HAVE ENOUGH LATVIANS
trainval/2i0dGoh3VUg/50007 AND HOW TO BE SIMPLY GREAT
trainval/2j00U6lUCSc/50001 ECONOMISTS CALL THESE EFFECTS COMPLEMENTARITIES BUT REALLY THAT'S JUST A FANCY WORD TO CAPTURE THE
trainval/2j00U6lUCSc/50002 RESOLVING THIS TERMINATOR MYTH SHOWS US THAT THERE ARE TWO FORCES AT PLAY ONE MACHINE
trainval/2j00U6lUCSc/50004 THERE'S COUNTLESS SYSTEMS OUT THERE THAT CAN DIAGNOSE MEDICAL PROBLEMS
trainval/2j00U6lUCSc/50005 THEY'VE FALLEN FOR THE INTELLIGENCE MYTH THE BELIEF THAT MACHINES HAVE TO COPY THE WAY THAT HUMAN
trainval/2j00U6lUCSc/50006 THINK HOW OFTEN YOU HEAR PEOPLE SAY TO YOU MACHINES CAN ONLY PERFORM TASKS THAT ARE PREDICTABLE OR REPETITIVE RULES
trainval/2j00U6lUCSc/50007 AND THESE THINGS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO ARTICULATE AND SO IT WAS THOUGHT THESE TASKS WOULD BE VERY HARD TO AUTOMATE
trainval/2j00U6lUCSc/50008 TO SEE THIS GO BACK TO THE CASE OF MAKING A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS
trainval/2j00U6lUCSc/50009 EARLIER IN THE YEAR A TEAM OF RESEARCHERS AT STANFORD ANNOUNCED THEY'D DEVELOPED A SYSTEM WHICH CAN TELL YOU WHETHER OR NOT A
trainval/2j00U6lUCSc/50010 HOW DOES IT WORK
trainval/2j00U6lUCSc/50011 IT DIDN'T MATTER THAT THAT HUMAN BEING THAT DOCTOR COULDN'T EXPLAIN HOW SHE'D PERFORMED THE TASK
trainval/2j00U6lUCSc/50012 A PICTURE THAT WE SEE ON OUR TELEVISION SCREENS IN BOOKS IN FILMS IN EVERYDAY COMMENTARY IS ONE WHERE AN ARMY
trainval/2j00U6lUCSc/50013 THE LUMP OF WORK WASN'T FIXED
trainval/2j00U6lUCSc/50014 AS THIS WORKER USED THE MACHINE AND BECAME MORE PRODUCTIVE THE PRICE OF WASHERS WOULD FALL DEMAND FOR WASHERS WOULD RISE
trainval/2j00U6lUCSc/50015 AND TODAY YOU HEAR PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE LUMP OF LABOR FALLACY TO THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF ALL TYPES OF WORK
trainval/2j00U6lUCSc/50016 THERE'S NO FIXED LUMP OF WORK OUT THERE TO BE DIVIDED UP BETWEEN PEOPLE AND MACHINES
trainval/2j00U6lUCSc/50017 NEW TASKS HAVE TO BE DONE
trainval/2j00U6lUCSc/50020 TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS RATHER THAN COMPLEMENT HUMAN BEINGS COMPLEMENTS MACHINES INSTEAD
trainval/2j00U6lUCSc/50021 HUMAN BEINGS ONLY STAND TO BENEFIT IF THEY RETAIN THE UPPER HAND IN ALL THESE COMPLEMENTED TASKS BUT
trainval/2j00U6lUCSc/50022 SO WHAT DO THESE THREE MYTHS TELL US THEN
trainval/2j00U6lUCSc/50023 THIS IS THE PATH WE'RE CURRENTLY ON
trainval/2j00U6lUCSc/50024 ALMOST EVERYONE LIVED ON OR AROUND THE POVERTY LINE
trainval/2j00U6lUCSc/50025 THOSE ECONOMIC PIES HAVE EXPLODED IN SIZE
trainval/2j00U6lUCSc/50026 IF ECONOMIC GROWTH CONTINUES AT TWO PERCENT OUR CHILDREN WILL BE TWICE AS RICH AS US
trainval/2j00U6lUCSc/50027 AS OTHER ECONOMISTS HAVE NOTED SOLVING THIS PROBLEM WON'T BE EASY
trainval/2j00U6lUCSc/50028 THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF DISCUSSION FOR INSTANCE ABOUT VARIOUS FORMS OF UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME AS ONE
trainval/2JSZ66uMRwc/50001 WE LIVE IN WHAT I CALL A G 0 WORLD NOT A G 7 NOT A G 20
trainval/2JSZ66uMRwc/50002 I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'M GOING TO DO
trainval/2JSZ66uMRwc/50003 I'M GOING TO CHANGE MY MIND I WILL SUPPORT ANYTHING YOU WANT TO DO IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL
trainval/2JSZ66uMRwc/50004 AND THAT WAS THE ORDER YOU CAN CALL IT A G 7 OR A G 20 BUT IN REALITY WAS A G 1 PLUS
trainval/2JSZ66uMRwc/50005 THE FIRST IS THAT THE U
trainval/2JSZ66uMRwc/50006 S DOESN'T WANT TO DO AS MUCH AS THEY HAVE HISTORICALLY
trainval/2JSZ66uMRwc/50007 THEY HAD THE FUKUSHIMA CRISIS
trainval/2JSZ66uMRwc/50008 THE JAPANESE AREN'T GOING TO DO IT
trainval/2JSZ66uMRwc/50009 THAT IS THE REASON NUMBER TWO
trainval/2JSZ66uMRwc/50010 HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT
trainval/2JSZ66uMRwc/50011 HOW SHOULD WE HANDLE NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION
trainval/2JSZ66uMRwc/50012 NO IT MEANS THEY HAVEN'T DONE THIS BEFORE
trainval/2JSZ66uMRwc/50014 IT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES IN THE WORLD TODAY
trainval/2JSZ66uMRwc/50015 WE STOP DOING GLOBAL WHEN GLOBAL DOESN'T WORK
trainval/2JSZ66uMRwc/50016 JAPAN AUSTRALIA SINGAPORE
trainval/2jTdZSPBRRE/50001 I'D LIKE TO OFFER A RADICAL THEORY OF CHANGE BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE WORKING AROUND THE WORLD WITH PEOPLE TRYING TO SOLVE OUR
trainval/2jTdZSPBRRE/50002 YOU'LL PROBABLY RECOGNIZE YOURSELF IN MORE THAN ONE
trainval/2ju61VPdTzw/50001 THEY RIFLED THROUGH MY BACKPACK
trainval/2ju61VPdTzw/50002 THEY PATTED ME DOWN
trainval/2ju61VPdTzw/50003 MIDDLE EASTERN MALE WITH A BACKPACK
trainval/2ju61VPdTzw/50004 THEY CALLED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SEE IF I WAS ON ANY WATCH LISTS
trainval/2ju61VPdTzw/50005 BUT THAT'S WHAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE DOING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE POOR
trainval/2ju61VPdTzw/50006 SO THERE'D BE TWO PEOPLE ON THE BUNKS AND TWO PEOPLE ON THE FLOOR ONE WITH NOWHERE TO GO EXCEPT RIGHT NEXT TO THE FILTHY TOILET
trainval/2ju61VPdTzw/50007 HE WAS HAPPY TO SHOW IT TO ME
trainval/2K6P014XXmQ/50001 IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO BETTER
trainval/2K6P014XXmQ/50002 THE SOUND WAVES AS THE AMBULANCE APPROACHED WERE COMPRESSED AND THEY CHANGED HIGHER IN PITCH
trainval/2K6P014XXmQ/50003 THE SAME THING HAPPENS WITH LIGHT
trainval/2K6P014XXmQ/50004 OBJECTS MOVING TOWARDS US THEIR LIGHT WAVES ARE COMPRESSED AND THEY APPEAR BLUER
trainval/2K6P014XXmQ/50005 OTHERWISE I'M LIMITED IN MY JOURNEY
trainval/2K6P014XXmQ/50006 ALL THAT DUST HAS GONE
trainval/2K6P014XXmQ/50007 BUT THE VIEW IS VERY DIFFERENT
trainval/2K6P014XXmQ/50008 AND WHEN THE VERY FIRST STARS AND GALAXIES SWITCHED ON THEY IONIZED THAT HYDROGEN
trainval/2K6P014XXmQ/50009 IT'S AT THE SAME FREQUENCY AS MY SURVEY BUT IT'S SO FAINT
trainval/2K6P014XXmQ/50010 IT'S A BILLIONTH THE SIZE OF ANY OF THE OBJECTS IN MY SURVEY
trainval/2K6P014XXmQ/50011 HOWEVER THERE'S A NEW RADIO TELESCOPE
trainval/2K6P014XXmQ/50012 WE'RE BUILDING THE SQUARE KILOMETRE ARRAY A NEW RADIO TELESCOPE AND IT'S GOING TO BE A THOUSAND TIMES BIGGER THAN THE
trainval/2K6P014XXmQ/50013 SO WE SHOULD FIND TENS OF MILLIONS OF GALAXIES
trainval/2Kk9R2rhwlQ/50001 MANY SELFIES MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE OF EXPERTISE OR NOT HAVE A BLUR WITHIN THE IMAGE ITSELF
trainval/2KSP7HvSZwg/50001 A BIT DANGEROUS SOMETIMES
trainval/2KSP7HvSZwg/50002 PERHAPS AFRICA CAN AVOID SOME OF THE MISTAKES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE
trainval/2KSP7HvSZwg/50003 YOU CAN GO AND BUY SOME OF THE GREAT TUNES
trainval/2KSP7HvSZwg/50004 MY IPOD'S FULL OF THEM
trainval/2KSP7HvSZwg/50005 YOU SEE THE MIDDLE CLASS GROW
trainval/2l0sZrrWlrU/50001 EVER SINCE MS
trainval/2l0sZrrWlrU/50002 HOWLAND STARTED HER BUSINESS CAPITALISM AND ROMANCE HAVE BEEN IN BED TOGETHER
trainval/2l0sZrrWlrU/50003 CAPITALISM AND ROMANCE WORKED TOGETHER LIKE A WELL OILED MACHINE
trainval/2l0sZrrWlrU/50004 THIS GIRL IS BECOMING A PRINCESS TODAY AND THAT'S PART OF THE EXCITEMENT
trainval/2L1R7OtJhWs/50001 WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES A BEHAVIOR BECOME AUTOMATIC
trainval/2L1R7OtJhWs/50002 SO HE IS THERE WITH HIS 3 BOYS
trainval/2L1R7OtJhWs/50003 A FEW YEARS AGO IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY MY PARTNER AND I WERE SITTING OUT ON OUR PATIO IN
trainval/2L1R7OtJhWs/50004 I KNEW THAT BUT WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW WAS THIS UKULELE IT WAS AN OLD MARTIN WITH
trainval/2L1R7OtJhWs/50005 AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S LIKE WITH ME AS I AM DOING MY RESEARCH HERE'S THIS GEM IT'S MY FAVORITE HABIT AND I'M GOING TO SHARE IT WITH YOU
trainval/2L1R7OtJhWs/50006 AND IT HAD A PICTURE OF A SAILBOAT ON IT ON THIS WATER
trainval/2L1R7OtJhWs/50007 AND ALONG THE WAY AS I WAS SHARING IT I'M A RESEARCHER SO OF COURSE I'M DOING RESEARCH ON HOW TO TEACH IT BETTER
trainval/2L1R7OtJhWs/50008 WATCH FOR 3 THINGS
trainval/2L1R7OtJhWs/50009 WATCH FOR THE RIPPLE EFFECTS
trainval/2L1R7OtJhWs/50010 HOW CAN I UNDERSTAND MY OWN BEHAVIOR BY PRACTICING THIS HABIT
trainval/2L1R7OtJhWs/50011 BUT I THINK YOU NEED TO PRACTICE IN THE RIGHT WAY
trainval/2L1R7OtJhWs/50012 AND I STARTED BLAMING MYSELF THAT I WASN'T GOOD AT PADDLE BOARDING
trainval/2L1R7OtJhWs/50013 YOU DON'T DO THAT
trainval/2L1R7OtJhWs/50015 YOU TRY ANOTHER SPOT
trainval/2L1R7OtJhWs/50016 THAT'S HOW YOU SHOULD PRACTICE THE SKILL OF BRINGING NEW BEHAVIORS INTO YOUR LIFE
trainval/2L1R7OtJhWs/50017 IN OTHER WORDS IT BECAME SOMETHING PEOPLE DID MORE AND MORE AUTOMATICALLY
trainval/2L1R7OtJhWs/50018 THEY'RE MORE LIKE PHILOSOPHERS
trainval/2L1R7OtJhWs/50019 VERY BLACK AND WHITE THINKING AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE IT CAME FROM
trainval/2L4BSVpvx1A/50001 SO ESSENTIALLY EVERYTHING THAT IS CREATED GOES THROUGH A SERIES OF LIFE CYCLE STAGES AND WE USE THIS
trainval/2L4BSVpvx1A/50002 ITS LITTLE CARBON MOLECULES THAT IT STORED UP AS IT WAS GROWING ARE NATURALLY RELEASED BACK INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AS CARBON
trainval/2L4BSVpvx1A/50003 THAT'S THE LATEST U
trainval/2L4BSVpvx1A/50004 IT'S WITH HOW PEOPLE USE THE PRODUCT
trainval/2L4BSVpvx1A/50005 THE MOMENT THAT VERY POPULAR TV SHOWS END
trainval/2L4BSVpvx1A/50006 WE HEARD SOME OF THOSE KINDS OF STRATEGIES BEING USED IN THE TESLA MOTORS CAR TODAY
trainval/2L4BSVpvx1A/50007 THESE KINDS OF APPROACHES ARE NOT HARD BUT UNDERSTANDING THE SYSTEM AND THEN LOOKING FOR VIABLE
trainval/2L4BSVpvx1A/50008 I SAID HOW COME YOU'RE NOT DOING SUSTAINABILITY
trainval/2L4BSVpvx1A/50009 I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS
trainval/2lJvr5UL2pQ/50001 WHAT MASK WORKS WHAT MASK DOESN'T WORK
trainval/2lJvr5UL2pQ/50003 I COULD GIVE YOU A BUNCH OF FLIP THIS THAT AND THE OTHER
trainval/2lJvr5UL2pQ/50004 BUT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW
trainval/2lJvr5UL2pQ/50005 AND SO FAR IN THE H5N1 CASES IN PEOPLE SIMILARLY BACTERIAL INFECTION HAS NOT BEEN AN ISSUE AT
trainval/2lJvr5UL2pQ/50006 AND I WOULD JUST ADD WE SAW THE SAME THING WITH SARS
trainval/2lJvr5UL2pQ/50007 SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO ALL OUT THERMONUCLEAR RESPONSE STIMULATE THE TOTAL CYTOKINE CASCADE
trainval/2lJvr5UL2pQ/50008 AND I THINK MY TIME IS UP
trainval/2m9kC1yRnLQ/50002 NOW YOU SAY THAT'S NOT MUCH USE BUT IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY CLOSE CONSIDERING WE CAN GET ABOUT 10000 TIMES MORE THAN WE
trainval/2m9kC1yRnLQ/50003 NOW THAT'S NOT QUITE GOOD ENOUGH BECAUSE THE LASER TO PUT THAT ENERGY IN WAS MORE ENERGY THAN THAT BUT IT
trainval/2m9kC1yRnLQ/50004 SO THIS ONE IS THE REAL ONE
trainval/2m9kC1yRnLQ/50005 BUT YOU HAVE TO COMPARE THAT TO THE COST OF MAKING MOORE'S LAW
trainval/2m9kC1yRnLQ/50006 THAT WON'T WORK
trainval/2m9kC1yRnLQ/50007 THOSE NEUTRONS HIT THE WALL OF THE MACHINE
trainval/2MifgJqOm3Q/50001 TRANSMEDIA IS A WHOLE NEW SET OF OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL TO TELL OUR
trainval/2MifgJqOm3Q/50002 TODAY WHEN WE WATCH THIS FILM WE'RE NOT SCARED
trainval/2mU8xezh7rQ/50003 I MEAN THIS IS 100 HUMIDITY THIS IS 100 MILES
trainval/2mU8xezh7rQ/50004 SO WHEN THE MARINES FLY OVER THEY DON'T ACTUALLY SEE WHAT'S GOING ON
trainval/2mU8xezh7rQ/50005 IT WAS AGREED AND THINGS WENT WELL
trainval/2mU8xezh7rQ/50006 THEY PUT SOME MONEY ASIDE TO HAVE AN EMERGENCY EVACUATION FUND
trainval/2MYsx6WArKY/50001 I'M OFFERING THE METAPHOR OF A STAIRCASE IN THE MIND
trainval/2MYsx6WArKY/50002 I'M SAYING WE ARE HOMO DUPLEX AND THIS STAIRCASE TAKES US UP FROM THE PROFANE LEVEL TO THE LEVEL OF THE
trainval/2MYsx6WArKY/50003 THE SLOWEST ROWERS THE WEAKEST ROWERS ARE GOING TO GET CUT FROM THE TEAM
trainval/2MYsx6WArKY/50004 AND AS YOU'LL SEE IN THIS SIMULATION AS THEY INTERACT THEY GAIN POINTS AS IT WERE THEY GROW AND WHEN THEY'VE DOUBLED
trainval/2NcetHNXaxU/50001 ONE IN THREE AMERICAN CHILDREN IS ON TRACK TO DEVELOP TYPE 2 DIABETES ONE IN TWO OF OUR CHILDREN OF COLOR
trainval/2NcetHNXaxU/50002 THEY HAVE ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH IN WASHINGTON AS IT IS
trainval/2NcetHNXaxU/50003 WE NEED TO IDENTIFY THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE MOST EFFECTIVE ON THE GROUND AND GIVE THEM BOOTS
trainval/2NENlXsW4pM/50001 IT SOUNDS GREAT
trainval/2NENlXsW4pM/50002 AND I EVEN LOVED SEEING BEHIND HER I COULD SEE THE LITTLE TEDDY BEAR SITTING ON THE PIANO BEHIND HER IN HER ROOM
trainval/2NENlXsW4pM/50003 I'D LIKE TO BE THE PERSON TO EDIT THIS ALL TOGETHER
trainval/2NENlXsW4pM/50004 I SAID THANK YOU SCOTT
trainval/2NENlXsW4pM/50005 I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU FOUND ME
trainval/2NENlXsW4pM/50006 AND SCOTT AGGREGATED ALL OF THE VIDEOS
trainval/2NENlXsW4pM/50007 HE SCRUBBED THE AUDIO
trainval/2NENlXsW4pM/50008 HE MADE SURE THAT EVERYTHING LINED UP
trainval/2NENlXsW4pM/50009 I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE THE POETRY OF ALL OF IT THESE SOULS ALL ON THEIR OWN DESERT
trainval/2NENlXsW4pM/50010 WE HAD A MILLION HITS IN THE FIRST MONTH AND GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION FOR IT
trainval/2NENlXsW4pM/50011 AND BECAUSE OF THAT THEN A LOT OF SINGERS STARTED SAYING ALL RIGHT WHAT'S VIRTUAL CHOIR 2
trainval/2NENlXsW4pM/50012 AND THERE WERE 900 PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THAT
trainval/2NENlXsW4pM/50013 IT WASN'T A VIRTUAL CHOIR
trainval/2NENlXsW4pM/50014 THIS WILL BE A PREMIERE TODAY
trainval/2NENlXsW4pM/50015 I ACTUALLY WAS MOVED TO TEARS WHEN I FIRST SAW IT
trainval/2NHV4AzSEzY/50001 YOU MIGHT WONDER
trainval/2NHV4AzSEzY/50002 BEFORE I TELL YOU THAT I WANT TO GO THROUGH A FEW BASIC CONCEPTS SO THAT WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE
trainval/2NHV4AzSEzY/50003 SO GENDER AND THE WAY PEOPLE IDENTIFY THEIR GENDER ARE THEREFORE OFTEN MUCH MORE COMPLEX AND THE REALITY IS MUCH MORE
trainval/2NHV4AzSEzY/50004 NOW THIS IS WHERE I COME IN AND TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MYSELF AND WHY I GET ASKED THESE QUESTIONS ALL THE TIME
trainval/2NHV4AzSEzY/50005 NOW THIS IS WHERE THINGS GOT A BIT TRICKY FOR ME
trainval/2NHV4AzSEzY/50006 I TURNED TO MY FRIEND AND I SAID I CAN'T DO THIS
trainval/2NHV4AzSEzY/50007 ON THE WAY BACK HOME AFTER THIS TRIP WE MET TWO ICELANDIC WOMEN ON THE SAME TRAIN TO THE AIRPORT AND AS
trainval/2NHV4AzSEzY/50008 WHEN I GOT BACK HOME I STARTED TELLING MORE PEOPLE THAT I WAS TRANS AND WHEN I WAS 18 I HAD MY BIG COMING
trainval/2NHV4AzSEzY/50009 I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE EXPECT ME TO CONFORM TO CERTAIN THINGS THAT I HAVE NO INTEREST IN CONFORMING TO
trainval/2NHV4AzSEzY/50010 SOMETIMES YOU'LL GET PEOPLE WHO WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU AREN'T THIS OR YOU ARE THIS OR YOU'RE NOT THAT AND YOU'RE
trainval/2NWpMqD8Qyk/50002 TAKE AWAY THE WATER THOSE MEMBRANES FALL APART
trainval/2NWpMqD8Qyk/50003 THE PLANT ITSELF SENSES DROUGHT
trainval/2NWpMqD8Qyk/50004 THE ANSWER IS YES THAT THERE IS A CORE SET OF GENES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN BOTH
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50001 NOT SO IF YOU'RE ADOPTING A RELIGIOUS MINDSET
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50002 THE OTHER THINGS THAT RELIGIONS DO IS TO ARRANGE TIME
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50003 JEROME AND HIS QUALITIES OF HUMILITY AND GOODNESS AND HIS GENEROSITY TO THE POOR
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50004 YOU WON'T DO THAT BY ACCIDENT YOU WILL DO THAT BECAUSE YOU ARE GUIDED TO DO THAT
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50005 NOW WE DON'T THINK THAT WAY
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50006 IN THE SECULAR WORLD WE THINK IF AN IDEA IS IMPORTANT I'LL BUMP INTO IT
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50007 I'LL JUST COME ACROSS IT
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50008 NONSENSE SAYS THE RELIGIOUS WORLD VIEW
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50009 OF COURSE THERE ARE NO DEITIES OR SUPERNATURAL SPIRITS OR ANGELS ETC
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50010 I REALLY LIKE TURNING THE PAGES OF THE OLD TESTAMENT
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50011 WHATEVER IT MAY BE YOU KNOW THE KIND OF THING I'M TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE ATTRACTED TO THE
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50012 I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50013 I THINK THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50014 THERE HAVE BEEN SOME VERY VOCAL ATHEISTS WHO'VE POINTED OUT NOT JUST THAT RELIGION IS
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50015 AND FOR ME ATHEISM 2
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50016 WE HAVE SECULARIZED BADLY I WOULD ARGUE
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50017 THEY SAID WHERE ARE PEOPLE GOING TO FIND THE MORALITY WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO FIND GUIDANCE AND WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO FIND
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50018 AND INFLUENTIAL VOICES CAME UP WITH ONE ANSWER
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50019 THEY SAID CULTURE
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50020 LET'S LOOK TO THE PLAYS OF SHAKESPEARE THE DIALOGUES OF PLATO THE NOVELS OF JANE AUSTEN
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50021 NOW I THINK THAT'S A VERY BEAUTIFUL IDEA AND A VERY TRUE IDEA
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50022 THEY DON'T THINK WE NEED IT
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50023 I THINK IT'S TOO EASY TO DISMISS THE WHOLE OF RELIGION THAT WAY
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50024 WE'RE ONLY JUST HOLDING IT TOGETHER
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50025 PERHAPS THIS IS JUST ME MAYBE YOU
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50026 YOU KNOW IN THE 18TH CENTURY IN THE U
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50027 IF YOU SAID TO A MODERN LIBERAL INDIVIDUALIST HEY HOW ABOUT A SERMON
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50028 I DON'T NEED ONE OF THOSE
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50029 WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SERMON AND OUR MODERN SECULAR MODE OF DELIVERY THE LECTURE
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50030 SIT THEM IN A CLASSROOM TELL THEM ABOUT PLATO AT THE AGE OF 20 SEND THEM OUT FOR A CAREER IN MANAGEMENT CONSULTANCY FOR 40 YEARS
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50032 SO RELIGIONS ARE CULTURES OF REPETITION
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50033 WE ASSOCIATE REPETITION WITH BOREDOM
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50034 THE NEW IS BETTER THAN THE OLD
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50035 IT SETS THINGS INTO PERSPECTIVE ETC
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50036 AFTER EVERY CONVINCING POINT PEOPLE WILL GO AMEN AMEN AMEN
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50037 AND YOU WOULD GO AMEN AMEN AMEN
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50038 AND WHEN THEY TEACH US A LESSON THEY DO IT VIA THE BODY
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50039 SO FOR EXAMPLE TAKE THE JEWISH IDEA OF FORGIVENESS
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50040 JEWS ARE VERY INTERESTED IN FORGIVENESS AND HOW WE SHOULD START ANEW AND START AFRESH
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50041 THEY TELL US TO HAVE A BATH
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50042 SO IN ORTHODOX JEWISH COMMUNITIES EVERY FRIDAY YOU GO TO A MIKVEH
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50043 NOW ART IS SOMETHING THAT IN THE SECULAR WORLD WE THINK VERY HIGHLY OF
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50044 A LOT OF OUR SURPLUS WEALTH GOES TO MUSEUMS ETC
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50045 YOU'VE HEARD THAT SAYING
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50046 WHY DON'T WE
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50047 THEY HAVE NO TROUBLE TELLING US WHAT ART IS ABOUT
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50048 ART IS ABOUT TWO THINGS IN ALL THE MAJOR FAITHS
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50049 AND SECONDLY IT'S TRYING TO REMIND YOU OF WHAT THERE IS TO FEAR AND TO HATE
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50050 AND THAT'S WHAT ART IS
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50051 ART IS A VISCERAL ENCOUNTER WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT IDEAS OF YOUR FAITH
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50052 SO AS YOU WALK AROUND A CHURCH OR A MOSQUE OR A CATHEDRAL WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO IMBIBE WHAT YOU'RE IMBIBING IS THROUGH YOUR
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50053 ESSENTIALLY IT'S PROPAGANDA
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50054 NOW THE WORD PROPAGANDA SETS OFF ALARM BELLS
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50055 WE THINK OF HITLER WE THINK OF STALIN
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50056 ART SHOULD BE ONE OF THE TOOLS BY WHICH WE IMPROVE OUR SOCIETY
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50057 ART SHOULD BE DIDACTIC
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50058 YOU'LL BE HANDED RICE CAKES
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50059 AND THEY DON'T REALLY CHANGE MUCH
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50060 NOW THINK ABOUT RELIGIONS THINK ABOUT ORGANIZED RELIGIONS
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50061 WHAT DO ORGANIZED RELIGIONS DO
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50062 THEY GROUP TOGETHER THEY FORM INSTITUTIONS
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50063 AND THAT HAS ALL SORTS OF ADVANTAGES
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50064 FIRST OF ALL SCALE MIGHT
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50065 AND THE MOON AND THE REFLECTION ON THE MOON WILL HAVE A SECURE PLACE IN YOUR HEART
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50067 WE RECOGNIZE THEM IN RELATION TO CORPORATIONS
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50068 AND CORPORATIONS ARE VERY LIKE RELIGIONS IN MANY WAYS EXCEPT THEY'RE RIGHT DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PYRAMID OF NEEDS
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50069 THEY'RE SELLING US SHOES AND CARS
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50070 AND THAT'S REALLY THE SPIRIT OF MY TALK
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50071 THERE'S SO MUCH WE CAN ABSORB
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50073 AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE RELIGIOUS WARS OF LATE HAVE IGNORED
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50074 I'VE SKETCHED A SORT OF BROAD FRAMEWORK
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50075 AND I SAY OF COURSE
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50076 AND THEY SAY SO AREN'T YOU SORT OF RELIGIOUS
trainval/2Oe6HUgrRlQ/50077 AND I GO NO
trainval/2OH1xSaKSmI/50001 WHAT ABOUT ALL THE SLUMS
trainval/2OH1xSaKSmI/50002 THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO TAKE A SECOND LOOK AT NUCLEAR POWER
trainval/2OH1xSaKSmI/50003 WE SAVE NATURE BY NOT USING IT BY NOT NEEDING IT
trainval/2OlhCITl1J4/50001 BUT IN THOSE YEARS OF STRUGGLE AND CHALLENGE SOME AMAZING THINGS HAPPENED SOME FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES WERE MADE
trainval/2OlhCITl1J4/50002 ACTUALLY IN 1978 WHEN I GRADUATED WITH MY PHD FROM STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND JOINED
trainval/2OlhCITl1J4/50003 BUT BY 2030 THREE GREEK UNIVERSITIES WERE IN THE WORLD'S TOP 40
trainval/2OlhCITl1J4/50004 HOW COULD THIS POSSIBLY BE
trainval/2OlhCITl1J4/50005 PROBABLY THE GREATEST SINGLE STRENGTH OF THE US SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION IS THE DIVERSITY OF
trainval/2OlhCITl1J4/50006 IT WASN'T EASY BUT THE CHANGE WAS MADE
trainval/2OlhCITl1J4/50007 ONE OF THE PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES IN GREECE IS AMONG THE TOP 40 AS WELL
trainval/2pb37k555AY/50001 I SAW EYES THAT COULD BREAK CYCLES AND REDEFINE WHAT MASCULINITY MEANT FOR A NEW GENERATION OF
trainval/2pb37k555AY/50002 WE'VE BEEN TOLD IT'S ABOUT RIDDING OUR CULTURE OF SEXIST THINKING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE WOMEN
trainval/2pb37k555AY/50003 I HAVE A FATHER
trainval/2PNumSv80R4/50001 INITIALLY GOVERNMENTAL RED TAPE KEPT WILDLIFE RESCUERS FROM GOING TO TRISTAN BUT EVENTUALLY A SMALL TEAM
trainval/2PNumSv80R4/50002 IN FACT MANY PENGUINS ARE STARVING AND THE PRIMARY CULPRITS ARE CLIMATE CHANGE AND
trainval/2PNumSv80R4/50003 SADLY SEVERAL RECENT OIL SPILLS HAVE HARMED PENGUINS
trainval/2Pp9ONyxBr8/50001 BECAUSE WHAT I'VE STARTED LEARNING WITH THE STUFF THAT I'VE BEEN DOING IS IF YOU WORK REALLY HARD TO CREATE SOMETHING INTERESTING AND
trainval/2Pp9ONyxBr8/50002 AND IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT THAT MY SECOND IDENTITY WAS BORN
trainval/2Pp9ONyxBr8/50003 AND I DID THIS FOR MONTHS BUT NOBODY WOULD RESPOND TO ME
trainval/2Pp9ONyxBr8/50004 THEY ALL THOUGHT I WAS SOME CRAZY SIXTH GRADER
trainval/2Pp9ONyxBr8/50006 THINK ABOUT SOMETHING IN YOUR HOMETOWN RIGHT NOW THAT'S ALWAYS BOTHERED YOU
trainval/2Pp9ONyxBr8/50007 IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW YOU EXPRESS YOURSELF JUST THAT YOU DO IT WITH PASSION AND THAT IT'S IN YOUR OWN UNIQUE VOICE IN
trainval/2Pp9ONyxBr8/50009 GENERATE BUZZ THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA
trainval/2pqSshPP4cw/50001 BUT NOT ALL NARCISSISTS ARE CREATED EQUAL
trainval/2PR51JQkib4/50001 INSTEAD THEY RELISH THE CHALLENGE AND ENJOY SOLVING THE RIDDLE OF HOW TO GET THEIR ROBOT BETTER WITH EACH
trainval/2PR51JQkib4/50002 SO PICTURE THIS
trainval/2R1lZSN4SSo/50001 I LOOK AT THE CHEMISTRY OF THE OCEAN IN THE PAST
trainval/2R1lZSN4SSo/50002 THE WAY I LOOK BACK IN THE PAST IS BY USING THE FOSSILIZED REMAINS OF DEEPWATER CORALS
trainval/2R1lZSN4SSo/50003 YOU CAN SEE AN IMAGE OF ONE OF THESE CORALS BEHIND ME
trainval/2R1lZSN4SSo/50004 IT WAS COLLECTED FROM CLOSE TO ANTARCTICA THOUSANDS OF METERS BELOW THE SEA SO VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE
trainval/2R1lZSN4SSo/50005 AND I'VE JUST GIVEN YOU A CARTOON VERSION OF ONE OF THE MAJOR DIFFERENCES YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN IF YOU WENT BACK THAT LONG
trainval/2R1lZSN4SSo/50006 THE ICECAPS WERE MUCH BIGGER
trainval/2R1lZSN4SSo/50007 THEY COVERED LOTS OF THE CONTINENT AND THEY EXTENDED OUT OVER THE OCEAN
trainval/2R1lZSN4SSo/50008 SO WE'RE PRETTY SURE THE OCEAN HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THIS
trainval/2R1lZSN4SSo/50010 I LOOK AT THE CHEMISTRY OF THE OCEAN TODAY
trainval/2R1lZSN4SSo/50011 SO WE USE A LASER TO ANALYZE URANIUM AND ONE OF ITS DAUGHTER PRODUCTS THORIUM IN THESE CORALS AND THAT TELLS US
trainval/2R1lZSN4SSo/50012 BUT 4000 YEARS IS NOT ENOUGH TO GET US BACK TO OUR LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM
trainval/2R3Njv0LjjM/50001 IT'S WHAT WAKES ME UP TO LIFE
trainval/2S0aEezKvBE/50001 ONLY ABOUT 250
trainval/2S0aEezKvBE/50002 THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS
trainval/2S0aEezKvBE/50003 BUT IT TOOK 23 YEARS TO GET THIS FAR
trainval/2S0aEezKvBE/50004 HOW DO WE GO FASTER
trainval/2S0aEezKvBE/50005 WELL AGAIN BY KNOWING SOMETHING ABOUT THE MOLECULAR PATHWAYS IT WAS POSSIBLE TO PICK ONE OF THOSE MANY MANY
trainval/2S0aEezKvBE/50006 WOULDN'T IT BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO A TEST A DRUG TO SEE IF IT'S EFFECTIVE AND SAFE WITHOUT HAVING TO
trainval/2S0aEezKvBE/50007 YOU PROBABLY KNOW IF YOU'VE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO SOME OF THE SCIENCE LITERATURE THAT YOU CAN NOW TAKE A SKIN CELL AND ENCOURAGE IT TO
trainval/2S0aEezKvBE/50008 THE PAYOFF IS ENORMOUS BOTH IN TERMS OF HEALTH AND IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH
trainval/2S0aEezKvBE/50009 WE NEED TO SUPPORT THAT
trainval/2S0aEezKvBE/50010 AND THIRD AND MAYBE MOST IMPORTANT WE NEED TALENT
trainval/2S0aEezKvBE/50011 THIS IS THE 21ST CENTURY BIOLOGY THAT YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR AND WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO TAKE THAT
trainval/2S0aEezKvBE/50012 IT MATTERS FOR NOW
trainval/2S0aEezKvBE/50013 IT MATTERS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
trainval/2S0aEezKvBE/50014 IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME JUST ASK SAM
trainval/2SEv4rU27HY/50001 HOW DO WE DO THAT
trainval/2SEv4rU27HY/50003 THEY ARE WELL STRUCTURED IN MANY CASES
trainval/2SEv4rU27HY/50004 THAT WILL NOT GUARANTEE THAT WE ACTUALLY CONVERGE TOWARD A SINGLE STORY OF VENICE BUT PROBABLY WE CAN ACTUALLY
trainval/2SEv4rU27HY/50005 MAYBE THERE'S NOT A SINGLE MAP
trainval/2SIk5ofBKco/50001 WHEN WE CHOOSE NOT TO GIVE WE ARE CUTTING OFF SOMEBODY ELSE'S OPPORTUNITIES AND THEREFORE WE'RE
trainval/2SIk5ofBKco/50002 SO FIND YOUR PASSION NOT SOMETHING I CARE ABOUT NOT SOMETHING THE PERSON SITTING NEXT TO YOU CARES
trainval/2SlbsnaSNNM/50001 THAT'S THE QUESTION I'VE BEEN STUDYING IN MY LAB
trainval/2SlbsnaSNNM/50002 OUR LEADERS ARE INCREDIBLY PASSIONATE ABOUT THEIR POSITIONS AND SO ARE WE
trainval/2SlbsnaSNNM/50003 WHAT MAKES US SO PASSIONATE ABOUT OUR POSITIONS
trainval/2SlbsnaSNNM/50004 WE THINK WE'RE RIGHT
trainval/2SlbsnaSNNM/50005 DON'T THINK TOO HARD ABOUT IT JUST THINK ABOUT WHAT YOUR SENSE IS OKAY
trainval/2SlbsnaSNNM/50006 YOU ASK PEOPLE TO TRY TO EXPLAIN
trainval/2SlbsnaSNNM/50007 EXPLAIN HOW A TOILET WORKS
trainval/2SlbsnaSNNM/50008 WHEN YOU SEE A CLOUD FROM A DISTANCE WHAT DO YOU SEE
trainval/2SlbsnaSNNM/50009 I PURPOSELY PICKED THIS EXAMPLE BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S PROBABLY PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO HAVE VERY STRONG OPINIONS ABOUT GMO IT'S A HOT
trainval/2SlbsnaSNNM/50010 MAYBE YOU'RE FOR MAYBE YOU'RE AGAINST IT
trainval/2SlbsnaSNNM/50011 WHAT I WOULD IMPLORE YOU TO DO THOUGH IS TO THINK ABOUT IT THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND
trainval/2SlbsnaSNNM/50012 NO I'M SORRY NOT EXPLAIN IT BUT PROVIDE REASONS FOR IT
trainval/2SlbsnaSNNM/50013 ONCE THEY REALIZE THAT THEIR LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE IS NOT JUSTIFIED BY THEIR KNOWLEDGE THEY MODERATE THEIR
trainval/2SlbsnaSNNM/50014 WE TEND TO TAKE THESE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT POLICY ISSUES AND WE SEE THEM
trainval/2t13Rq4oc7A/50001 THIS IS ONE OF X'S MANTRAS
trainval/2t13Rq4oc7A/50002 THE WINDS ARE TOO STRONG IT WOULD BE BLOWN AWAY
trainval/2tBuvxXxlS4/50001 EVERY MEDICATION THAT WE PRESCRIBE OR THAT WE'VE TAKEN OURSELVES OR WE'VE GIVEN
trainval/2tBuvxXxlS4/50002 EQUINE VETERINARIANS ALSO KNOW THAT OCCASIONALLY A MARE SOON AFTER
trainval/2tCcoSRZqVY/50001 HOW DO WE GET PEOPLE TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT INEQUALITY AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF INEQUALITY IN TERMS OF HEALTH
trainval/2tCcoSRZqVY/50002 AND THE EXPENSIVE PAIN MEDICATION WORKED BETTER
trainval/2tCcoSRZqVY/50003 WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A COUNTRY THAT WOULD MAKE YOU WANT TO JOIN IT KNOWING THAT YOU COULD END RANDOMLY
trainval/2tCcoSRZqVY/50004 WE CAN ASK IT ABOUT OTHER THINGS AS WELL
trainval/2tCcoSRZqVY/50005 WE WENT TO HARVARD AND WE CHECKED ALMOST EVERY DEPARTMENT AND IN FACT FROM HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL WHERE A FEW PEOPLE
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50001 IF YOU'RE IN L
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50002 FIRST OFF I'M NOT A DOCTOR
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50003 I MAKE GAMES FOR A LIVING
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50004 DEPENDING ON WHO YOU ASK ONLY 5 TO 8 OF ALZHEIMER'S IS LINKED TO A SINGLE GENE TO BEGIN WITH
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50005 I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I'M INCREDIBLY LAZY WHEN IT COMES TO EXERCISING
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50006 EXERCISING FOR THE SAKE OF VANITY NEVER MOTIVATED ME BECAUSE I JUST FIGURE PLUS OR MINUS TEN TWENTY POUNDS WHO CARES
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50007 YOU CAN LEARN A NEW INSTRUMENT A COMPLICATED DANCE OR LANGUAGE
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50008 SO LEARN BALLROOM DANCING
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50009 EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT LEAD IN SMOKING
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50010 THEY'RE BEING POISONED
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50011 SO DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT TAKING NOTES
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50012 THERE'S A WEBSITE CALLED COSMETICSDATABASE
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50013 BEING SOCIAL IS INCREDIBLY GOOD FOR YOU
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50014 IF YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS IF YOU JUST MOVED IF YOUR FRIENDS ARE NEGATIVE AND YOU'RE GETTING RID OF THEM AFTER THE LAST TIPS THAT
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50015 ORG IS GREAT
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50016 STRESS REWIRES YOUR BRAIN
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50017 SO IT'S NOT GOOD FOR YOU
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50018 I WAS WORKING AT THIS DAY JOB FUNDING ANTI
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50019 AGINGGAMES AND IT WAS REALLY STRESSFUL AS I WAS READING THE STUDY ABOUT HOW STRESS SHRINKS YOUR BRAIN
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50020 THAT'S MY JOB
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50021 I ENDED UP LEAVING SHORTLY THEREAFTER
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50022 YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS PREVENTION UNDERSTANDS NUTRITION UNDERSTANDS EXERCISE UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50023 IF YOU HAVE A THYROID PROBLEM THAT ACTUALLY MAKES THE THYROID PROBLEM WORSE
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50024 SO A GOOD DOCTOR KNOWS THAT
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50025 IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO TRY TO KEEP TRACK OF THE STUFF YOURSELF
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50026 AND A GOOD DOCTOR KNOWS HOW TO DO THAT
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50027 SO PICK ANY CAUSE THAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU AND GO OUT THERE AND DO IT
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50028 SO ALWAYS WEAR YOUR SEAT BELT
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50029 ALWAYS PICK A SAFER CARD MAKE THAT ONE OF YOUR PRIMARY SCREENINGS AND NEVER TEXT WHILE YOU'RE DRIVING
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50030 SOMEONE'S TEXTING IN THE CAR TELL THEM TO PULL OVER
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50031 MEDITERRANEAN DIET INVOLVES SEVEN TO TEN SERVINGS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES PER DAY
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50032 I KNOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT BUT ACTUALLY IT'S REALLY HARD TO GAIN WEIGHT WITH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50033 SO YOU ACTUALLY END UP FILLING UP WITH THAT AND LOSING WEIGHT
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50034 THEY TRACKED 600078 NUNS OVER THE COURSE OF THEIR LIVES AND A LOT OF THE NUNS EVEN GAVE
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50035 THEY FOUND THAT THE NUNS WHO HAD THE HIGHEST USAGE OF POSITIVE EMOTION
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50036 TALK BACK TO IT
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50037 I MEAN OUR BASIC GOAL IS TO IMPROVE LIVES AROUND THE WORLD
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50038 IN THE US WHAT THAT MEANS IS SPONSORING ALZHEIMER'S PREVENTION RESEARCH AND
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50039 SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING
trainval/2tcEgqTWbxQ/50040 IN GENERAL THE COMPANY DONATES 20 OF ITS PRETAX PROFIT TO CHARITY
trainval/2TDLN61HKKc/50005 THIS WAS A TRAGIC YET VERY HOPEFUL STORY A STORY THAT HAS INSPIRED SO MANY
trainval/2TDLN61HKKc/50006 I AM WRITING A BOOK ABOUT HER STORY
trainval/2TDLN61HKKc/50007 AND ONE OF THE FELLOW SPEAKERS AT THE CONFERENCE LAST YEAR ALEXIS
trainval/2TDLN61HKKc/50008 SHE S NOW BEEN RESETTLED WITH HER FAMILY TO SWEDEN AND SHE IS PUTTING IT TOWARDS HER EDUCATION
trainval/2TDLN61HKKc/50009 IT S REALLY HELPING HER TO START HER NEW LIFE
trainval/2TDLN61HKKc/50010 NO OTHER COUNTRY HAS RECEIVED SO MANY REFUGEES BUT A SINGLE STORY A SINGLE STORY
trainval/2TDLN61HKKc/50011 AND NO TIME SINCE WWII HAVE WE HAD SO MANY PEOPLE ON THE RUN
trainval/2TDLN61HKKc/50012 WE ARE SEEING HEARING WONDERFUL STORIES OF INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS BY LOCAL GREEK
trainval/2TDLN61HKKc/50013 IT REALLY WARMS MY HEART
trainval/2TDLN61HKKc/50014 ONE AFTER THE OTHER THESE KIND OF STORIES PRIVATE COMPANIES COMING IN TO PROVIDE FOOD
trainval/2TDLN61HKKc/50015 AND I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT A FLATTENING OF CULTURES RELIGION AND ALL THAT AND LANGUAGES
trainval/2TDLN61HKKc/50017 AND COMPARE THEM TO THE IMMIGRANTS COMING IN THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT
trainval/2URf46UY7SA/50001 I HAVE A QUESTION
trainval/2URf46UY7SA/50002 WHAT IS THE CONTEXT
trainval/2URf46UY7SA/50003 SO THEY MAY NOT LOOK LIKE HUMANS THEY MAY LOOK LIKE A VERY SMART ROBOT
trainval/2URf46UY7SA/50004 WE'RE NOT SURE
trainval/2VLje8QRrwg/50001 I MEAN HOW CAN WE DO THOSE WITHOUT WORDS
trainval/2VLje8QRrwg/50002 IT DOESN'T JUST REPLACE THE WORDS
trainval/2vVAzRN5ez8/50001 MY NAME IS VAISHALI
trainval/2vVAzRN5ez8/50002 I DIDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL
trainval/2W1jvTEjc1s/50001 SHE HAD THE BEST DEFINITION THAT I RESONATED WITH
trainval/2W1jvTEjc1s/50002 WE WERE IN ANTICIPATION OF THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW
trainval/2W1jvTEjc1s/50003 EVERYTHING IN OUR LIFE
trainval/2W1jvTEjc1s/50004 LAST NIGHT I HAD THE STRANGEST DREAM I'VE EVER DREAMED BEFORE
trainval/2wseM6wWd74/50003 OUR TELOMERES ARE LOSING THE WAR OF ATTRITION FASTER
trainval/2wseM6wWd74/50004 AND THERE ARE MANY WEBSITES MARKETING SUCH DUBIOUS PRODUCTS
trainval/2wseM6wWd74/50005 I SAW BEYOND THE GENES AND THE CHROMOSOMES INTO THE LIVES OF THE REAL PEOPLE WE WERE
trainval/2wu28tI9VkM/50001 SO MA WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO ME ABOUT GRANDMA AND WHEN THEY GREW UP BUT I COULDN'T PAY ATTENTION TO HER BECAUSE I WAS
trainval/2wu28tI9VkM/50002 I'M A JOURNALIST AND FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS I'VE BEEN DOCUMENTING THE LIVES OF US CITIZENS WHO'VE LOST PEOPLE TO
trainval/2wu28tI9VkM/50003 THEY RALLIED BEHIND HIM
trainval/2wu28tI9VkM/50004 AND THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE UNDOCUMENTED BECAUSE NUMBERS FOR THAT POPULATION ARE AT BEST COMPLEX ESTIMATES
trainval/2wu28tI9VkM/50005 A 2017 POLL BY UCLA OF LA COUNTY RESIDENTS FOUND THAT 30 PERCENT
trainval/2xKXLPuju8U/50001 YOU WANT TO TOUCH THEM TASTE THEM SMELL THEM YOU CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THEM
trainval/2xs8qmk0OPc/50001 THIS OK WE HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING
trainval/2xs8qmk0OPc/50002 WE HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING
trainval/2Yt6rajSS1M/50001 MY PARENTS WANTED OUT OF ME WHAT ANY TYPICAL PARENT WOULD WANT OUT OF HIS CHILD
trainval/2Yt6rajSS1M/50002 AND THE JUDGES WERE JUST SO BLOWN AWAY BY THE FACT THAT A BUNCH OF TEENAGERS COULD GO AND CREATE THINGS CAN
trainval/2Yt6rajSS1M/50003 BUT WE QUICKLY REALIZED IT'S NOT THAT EASY
trainval/2Yt6rajSS1M/50004 THERE WAS ALMOST NO INTEREST
trainval/2Yt6rajSS1M/50005 THAT JUST INSPIRED ME SO MUCH
trainval/2ZviHInGBJQ/50001 NOW THERE ARE FEW WORDS TO DESCRIBE THE ALL CONSUMING FEELINGS OF VULNERABILITY SHAME UPSET AND INJUSTICE THAT I WAS
trainval/2ZviHInGBJQ/50002 I DON'T KNOW WHO THE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE ARE
trainval/2ZviHInGBJQ/50003 I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOU
trainval/2ZviHInGBJQ/50004 MY COMMUNITY WILL NOT FEEL WE ARE UNSAFE WALKING HOME AFTER DARK
trainval/2ZviHInGBJQ/50005 I'D READ NEWS REPORTS STATISTICS AND KNEW HOW COMMON SEXUAL ASSAULT WAS YET I COULDN'T ACTUALLY NAME A SINGLE PERSON THAT I'D HEARD
trainval/2ZviHInGBJQ/50006 THERE WAS A MAN IN THE NETHERLANDS WHO DESCRIBED HOW HE WAS DATE RAPED ON A VISIT TO LONDON AND WASN'T TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY ANYONE HE REPORTED HIS CASE
trainval/2ZviHInGBJQ/50007 I'VE BEEN INSPIRED BY MANY AND I HOPE I CAN BE AS STRONG AS THEM SOMEDAY
trainval/2ZviHInGBJQ/50008 I'M SURE I WILL
trainval/2ZviHInGBJQ/50009 BEFORE I HAD TIME TO PROCESS WHAT WAS HAPPENING A HAND WAS CLAPPED AROUND MY MOUTH SO THAT I COULD NOT BREATHE AND THE
trainval/2ZviHInGBJQ/50010 BUT IT'S AS IF BECAUSE THEY MIGHT BE BEHIND A SCREEN IN THE COMFORT IN THEIR OWN HOME WHEN ON SOCIAL MEDIA PEOPLE FORGET THAT WHAT THEY'RE
trainval/2ZviHInGBJQ/50011 BUT I DON'T WANT TO DISCOURAGE A SOCIAL MEDIA RESPONSE BECAUSE I OWE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NOTGUILTY CAMPAIGN ALMOST
trainval/2ZviHInGBJQ/50012 BUT I DO WANT TO ENCOURAGE A MORE CONSIDERED APPROACH TO THE WAY WE USE IT TO RESPOND TO INJUSTICE
trainval/2ZviHInGBJQ/50014 SOMEONE HAD HURT ME AND THOSE WHO I LOVED UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE HELD TO ACCOUNT OR RECOGNIZE THE DAMAGE THEY HAD CAUSED
trainval/2ZviHInGBJQ/50015 IT'S STILL AN ISSUE MANY PEOPLE BLAME VICTIMS FOR
trainval/2ZviHInGBJQ/50016 WITH US THIS WAS HOLDING MY ATTACKER TO ACCOUNT AND MANY OTHERS
trainval/2ZviHInGBJQ/50018 BUT IN THIS WAY WE CAN BEGIN TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA AS AN ACTIVE TOOL FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AS A TOOL TO EDUCATE TO STIMULATE
trainval/2ZviHInGBJQ/50019 DIVISIVE TWITTER TROLLS WERE QUICK TO CREATE EVEN MORE INJUSTICE COMMENTING ON MY ATTACKER'S ETHNICITY OR
trainval/2zvjW9arAZ0/50001 YOU'RE STUCK IN THE BEGINNING CLASS
trainval/2zvjW9arAZ0/50002 THINK ABOUT IT
trainval/2zvjW9arAZ0/50003 WHEN YOU'RE 2 3 YEARS OLD AND YOU SAY A WORD WRONG OVER AND OVER NO ONE CORRECTS YOU
trainval/2zvjW9arAZ0/50004 WITH YOUR SPEAKING VOICE YOU'VE NEVER LOST IT
trainval/2zvjW9arAZ0/50005 THAT'S THE MISTAKE A LOT OF US MUSIC TEACHERS MAKE
trainval/2zvjW9arAZ0/50006 DON'T GET ME WRONG
trainval/2zvjW9arAZ0/50007 DOESN'T MATTER HOW GREAT I AM AS A BASSIST OR ANY INSTRUMENT
trainval/2zvjW9arAZ0/50008 DOESN'T MATTER HOW GREAT I AM
trainval/2zvjW9arAZ0/50009 AND WE WERE ABLE TO USE MUSIC TO GIVE THEM AN IDEA WHAT THE NEXT FOUR YEARS OF THEIR LIFE MIGHT BE LIKE
trainval/2zvjW9arAZ0/50010 POLITICS RACISM EQUALITY INEQUALITY RELIGION
trainval/2zvjW9arAZ0/50011 I CAN DO IT THROUGH MUSIC AND I'M STILL SAFE
trainval/30e60EOO5mo/50001 I PUT THAT MASK ON SO VERY TIGHT AND YEAH I GOT INTO A LOT OF FIGHTS
trainval/30e60EOO5mo/50002 I HAVE EXITS AND ENTRANCES
trainval/30KJRb4MzSg/50002 IT WAS SOMETHING IN MY HEART THAT I KNEW
trainval/30KJRb4MzSg/50003 DID YOU GUYS HAVE A SECRET LANGUAGE
trainval/30KJRb4MzSg/50004 AND WHAT IS TOO SHORT
trainval/30KJRb4MzSg/50005 AND GRADUALLY THE OTHER BOYS DISCOVERED GIRLS TOO
trainval/30kPKxGuHLA/50001 OUR NEW GOAL SHOULD BE THAT WHEN EVERY FAMILY THINKS ABOUT WHERE THEY WANT TO LIVE AND WORK THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO
trainval/31iuh9pfFwg/50001 WE STARTED PLAYING MUSIC AROUND THE SAME TIME
trainval/31iuh9pfFwg/50002 WHEN I WAS 21 I WAS ABLE TO GO AND STUDY WITH THE GREAT SPANISH MASTER ANDR S SEGOVIA IN
trainval/31iuh9pfFwg/50003 I WAS TRANSPORTED
trainval/31iuh9pfFwg/50004 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/31iuh9pfFwg/50005 AND LIKE I SAID I WAS FASCINATED WITH THE MOON THE NIGHT SKY BUT I WAS ACTUALLY
trainval/31iuh9pfFwg/50006 THE SAME SONG CAN AFFECT DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT WAYS
trainval/31ojbLK0vU4/50001 IS THAT COOL
trainval/31PyAjy6Nl0/50001 IN ORDER FOR WESTWOOD TO CHANGE IT HAD TO BE OWNED BY THE PEOPLE SO WE DEVELOPED A RESIDENT LED APPROACH
trainval/31PyAjy6Nl0/50002 EMPLOYEES HAD TO WALK THROUGH METAL DETECTORS AND WHEN LEAVING RECEIVE PAT DOWNS TO MAKE SURE THEY
trainval/34a7UEzZdsA/50001 I WAS JUMPING WITH A CAMERA ON MY HELMET FILMING THE OTHERS
trainval/34a7UEzZdsA/50002 I DIDN'T SEE MY LIFE FLICKERING BEFORE MY EYES
trainval/34a7UEzZdsA/50003 DYING DIDN'T SCARE ME
trainval/34a7UEzZdsA/50004 I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO DIE
trainval/34a7UEzZdsA/50005 I DIDN'T EVEN ASK HIM ONE SINGLE QUESTION
trainval/34a7UEzZdsA/50006 I HAD NOW SPENT FOUR MONTHS IN THE HOSPITAL
trainval/34a7UEzZdsA/50007 AT THIS POINT I HAD NO POWER TO MAKE THE BIG CHANGES
trainval/36m1oStM05g/50001 WE SEE EACH OTHER FOR WHO WE ARE ON THE INSIDE
trainval/36m1oStM05g/50002 BUT I D NEVER REALLY HAD TO APPLY ALL OF THESE ASPECTS OF MY PHILOSOPHY TO THE TEST AT ONE TIME
trainval/38OUCtzkT4Q/50001 IS THERE GOING TO BE A LOT OF FOOD
trainval/38OUCtzkT4Q/50002 THE PROBLEM IS WE CANNOT TEST THIS IN HUMANS BECAUSE ETHICALLY WE CANNOT ADMINISTER CHILD ADVERSITY IN A
trainval/38OUCtzkT4Q/50003 SO IN THIS EXPERIMENT WE TOOK PLACENTAS OF MONKEYS THAT HAD DIFFERENT SOCIAL STATUS
trainval/38OUCtzkT4Q/50004 AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT THE MONKEY NUMBER ONE IS MUCH HEALTHIER THAN MONKEY
trainval/38OUCtzkT4Q/50005 AND THERE WERE PREGNANT MOTHERS DURING THAT TIME
trainval/38OUCtzkT4Q/50006 IN RATS WE DO THE SAME THING
trainval/38OUCtzkT4Q/50007 AND YOU CAN SEE THE TWO GROUPS OF MONKEYS EXTREMELY WELL SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER
trainval/3aJma6R8Ptw/50001 RIVES AND I WERE INVITED TO COME AND HOST
trainval/3aJma6R8Ptw/50002 MANY OF US WILL WALK OUT OF HERE THINKING OF DOING SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT OR MAYBE HAVING A DIFFERENT LENS ON AN
trainval/3aJma6R8Ptw/50003 WE PAIR UP EDUCATORS WITH ANIMATORS TO CREATE LESSONS AND TEACHERS
trainval/3aJma6R8Ptw/50004 AND THAT JUST LAUNCHED REALLY OFFICIALLY IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR AND THERE ARE ALREADY 12 OF THOSE TED ED CLUBS HERE IN
trainval/3aJma6R8Ptw/50006 IT'S GOING TO BE ON NOVEMBER 15TH AND THERE IS GOING TO BE A LIVE STREAM AND HOPEFULLY YOU
trainval/3aJma6R8Ptw/50007 AND IT'S SO FUN TO WATCH THIS GROW AS A MOVEMENT AND THINK ABOUT HOW THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED WAS RIGHT
trainval/3aJma6R8Ptw/50008 I'M TOO SCARED
trainval/3B24RaqA33k/50001 THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I UNDERSTOOD VISCERALLY JUST FOR A FLEETING MOMENT
trainval/3bFabjnryE0/50001 WELL OK NOW I WANT TO BECOME AN ARCHITECT
trainval/3bFabjnryE0/50002 THE BUILDING THERE
trainval/3BS1itqCKHo/50001 I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY OF THINGS PROFOUND THOUGH THAT IS
trainval/3BS1itqCKHo/50002 AND IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES THE WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING THAT GET CREATED ARE WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING
trainval/3BS1itqCKHo/50003 THAT WAS THE ONLY REASON ANYONE EVER DID ANYTHING
trainval/3BS1itqCKHo/50004 SO WE CREATED A FACTORY SYSTEM CONSISTENT WITH THAT FALSE VIEW OF HUMAN NATURE
trainval/3BS1itqCKHo/50005 NOW NOTICE THE WORD HERE IS BECOME
trainval/3BS1itqCKHo/50006 NOW I KNOW OF COURSE WE HAVE TO MAKE A LIVING BUT NOBODY IN THIS ROOM THINKS THAT THAT'S THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION
trainval/3BS1itqCKHo/50007 JUST WHAT KIND OF HUMAN NATURE DO YOU WANT TO HELP DESIGN
trainval/3dqXHHCc5lA/50001 HIS RESEARCH SHOWED THAT YOU COULD REDUCE THE MORTALITY RATES FROM SEPTICEMIA FROM
trainval/3dqXHHCc5lA/50002 AND THE HEALTHY DIET IS ONE THAT IS FRESH HIGH IN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
trainval/3dqXHHCc5lA/50003 WHEN PEOPLE GET WELL THEY GET WELL ACROSS THE BOARD NOT ONLY IN THE SYMPTOMS THAT WE TREATED
trainval/3dqXHHCc5lA/50004 SO THIS IS MY IDEA WORTH SPREADING
trainval/3DsHHfu4Sco/50001 THEY GROW WELL IN MANY MANY COUNTRIES
trainval/3DsHHfu4Sco/50002 VOILA THE OXYGEN THAT WE ALL NEED TO SURVIVE
trainval/3DsHHfu4Sco/50003 SO THANK YOU NASA
trainval/3dy4SGkSD8M/50001 YOU HAD NO TRAINING AS A WRITER FORMALLY BUT YOU HUSTLED YOUR WAY IN
trainval/3dy4SGkSD8M/50002 THEN CAME THE MOVIES
trainval/3dy4SGkSD8M/50003 YOU START PEOPLE FOR THE AMERICAN WAY
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50001 BUT BECAUSE IT'S A BIG AND COMPLICATED SUBJECT I'M GOING TO FOCUS JUST ON ONE ASPECT IN THE SHORT TIME I'VE GOT TO TALK TO YOU
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50002 AND THAT ASPECT IS GOING TO BE
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50003 I WAS WORKING IN THE OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENT AT MY PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL I WAS CONSULTING WITH A YOUNG LADY WHO WAS PRETTY
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50004 I HAVE NO PERSONAL INTEREST IN THIS SUBJECT
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50005 I SAID DARLING THE PUBLISHERS HAVE JUST RUNG ME UP AND THEY HAVE COMMISSIONED ME TO WRITE THE VERY NEXT BOOK THEY
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50006 AND THEY ARE VERY FRUSTRATED
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50007 THEY MAY WANT A DATE THEY MAY WANT A FERRARI IN THEIR GARAGE OR THEY MAY WANT A MILLION POUNDS IN THEIR BANK ACCOUNT
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50008 THEY ALWAYS TELL ME WHAT THEY WANT AND WHAT THEY'RE NOT GETTING
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50009 I FIND THAT MOST PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE RATHER LOW SELF ESTEEM WHEN IT COMES TO SEDUCTION
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50011 I REALLY LIKE THIS RESTAURANT
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50013 NO I DON'T LIKE IT
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50014 SO FAR SO OBVIOUS
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50015 SO IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO PLAY THE GAME OF LIFE THAT'S FINE BUT BE AWARE THAT YOU MIGHT RUN INTO TROUBLE IF
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50016 THEN YOU GO OVER AND TALK TO THEM GET TO KNOW THEM AND YOU'RE ENTERING THE INTEREST PHASE
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50017 THEN MAYBE AFTER A FEW DAYS OR WEEKS YOU MIGHT TRANSITION INTO THE MAINTENANCE PHASE WHICH IS A LONG TERM
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50018 WE ALL KNOW PEOPLE WHO WE THINK
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50019 THIS IS A WONDERFUL PERSON HOW COME THEY ARE SINGLE
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50020 WHAT THEIR EXPERIENCE OF YOU WAS THAT YOU WERE RATHER DIFFICULT IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE DATE AND THEN YOU WARMED UP TO THEM
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50021 AND THAT CONSTANT CYCLING MEANS THAT LIFE AND EVEN LONG TERM COMMITTED RELATIONSHIPS ARE A LONG TERM
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50022 LIFE IS A SEDUCTION EVEN LONG TERM MARRIAGES ARE A CONSTANT SEDUCTION
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50023 AND THE ATTENTION INTEREST AND MAINTENANCE MODEL IS REALLY HELPFUL IN UNDERSTANDING THAT
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50024 AND THEY THINK THEY HAD AN IMPACT ON YOU
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50025 AND THE PROBLEM WITH THE MODERN WORLD AND WEBSITES TINDER AND APPS IS THAT IT'S KIND OF DOING AWAY WITH THE WHOLE
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50026 SHE CAN'T SAY WORDS PROPERLY THAT HAVE THE LETTER R IN THEM
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50027 HE SPENDS THE NEXT THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS WRITING A PLAY
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50028 AND THIS PLAY HAS A VERY SPECIAL FEATURE
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50029 IT HAS NO WORDS IN IT WITH THE LETTER R
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50030 THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS LATER HE RETURNS TO THE BAR PRESENTS THE PLAY TO THE ACTRESS AND THE SEDUCTION
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50031 AND THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT HAVING AN IMPACT WHICH IS VERY SEDUCTIVE
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50032 IT'S THE PLAY THAT'S SEXY
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50033 WHY IS THAT
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50034 WELL LET'S LOOK AT BETWEEN THE LINES
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50035 IT'S KIND OF WHAT WE'RE SAYING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE A LOT OF THE TIME
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50036 WHAT DOES THE PLAY WITH NO WORDS WITH THE LETTER R SAY
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50037 WHAT IT SAYS IS DON'T CHANGE A THING
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50038 YOU SEE YOU CAN'T GO TO A PETROL STATION AND BUY A PLAY OFF THE SELF THAT HAS NO WORDS IN IT WITH THE
trainval/3E46oWB4V0s/50039 IS IT POSSIBLE THAT LEAVING YOU WANTING MORE IS A KIND OF SEDUCTION
trainval/3E7hkPZSHTk/50001 SO I NEVER SIGNED UP
trainval/3E7hkPZSHTk/50002 BY DEFINITION THE MARKET IS NOT GOING TO GIVE A LOT OF VALUE TO THOSE BEHAVIORS
trainval/3E7hkPZSHTk/50003 IT'S ONE THING TO SPEND A COUPLE OF HOURS AT A SLOT MACHINE IN LAS VEGAS BUT IF YOU BRING ONE WITH YOU AND YOU PULL THAT HANDLE ALL DAY LONG
trainval/3E7hkPZSHTk/50004 WE'RE NOT WIRED FROM IT
trainval/3E7hkPZSHTk/50005 IT SHORT CIRCUITS THE BRAIN AND WE'RE STARTING TO FIND IT HAS ACTUAL COGNITIVE CONSEQUENCES ONE OF THEM BEING THIS SORT OF PERVASIVE
trainval/3E7hkPZSHTk/50006 IT SOUNDS OLD FASHIONED BUT THEY WERE ONTO SOMETHING BACK THEN
trainval/3E7hkPZSHTk/50007 YOU DON'T HAVE THE CONSTANT HUM OF STIMULI AND THE BACKGROUND HUM OF ANXIETY THAT COMES ALONG WITH THAT
trainval/3E7hkPZSHTk/50008 SO LIFE WITHOUT SOCIAL MEDIA IS REALLY NOT SO BAD
trainval/3E7hkPZSHTk/50009 MANY MORE PEOPLE WOULD BE MUCH BETTER OFF IF THEY DIDN'T USE THIS TECHNOLOGY
trainval/3E7hkPZSHTk/50010 I JUST ASK THAT YOU DIRECT YOUR COMMENTS TOWARDS TWITTER
trainval/3ELnyoso6vI/50001 AND IF YOU MARRY THIS FACT WITH THE INCREDIBLE ABUNDANCE OF INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE IN OUR WORLD TODAY
trainval/3ELnyoso6vI/50002 OTHER EXAMPLES ARE RECYCLING
trainval/3ELnyoso6vI/50003 WE ALL KNOW WE NEED TO RECYCLE MORE
trainval/3ELnyoso6vI/50004 HOW DO WE MAKE IT HAPPEN
trainval/3ELnyoso6vI/50005 YOU COULD FIGHT FOR YOUR COUNTRY YOU COULD DIE FOR YOUR COUNTRY YOU COULD SERVE IN YOUR COUNTRY'S CIVIL SERVICE BUT YOU DIDN'T
trainval/3F2jACWwKdU/50002 WE'VE GOT TO ATTACK THAT BRAND IN FRONT OF THEM
trainval/3F2jACWwKdU/50003 THERE'S TWO ESSENTIAL WAYS OF DOING THAT IF WE CARRY ON THIS BRAND THEME
trainval/3F2jACWwKdU/50004 WE'VE GOT TO COMPETE
trainval/3F2jACWwKdU/50006 THAT'S WHERE THEY RECRUIT FROM
trainval/3F2jACWwKdU/50007 THAT'S WHERE THEY GET THEIR POWER AND STRENGTH
trainval/3F2jACWwKdU/50008 THAT'S WHERE THEIR CONSUMERS COME FROM
trainval/3F2jACWwKdU/50009 AND WE HAVE TO GET OUR MESSAGING IN THERE
trainval/3F2jACWwKdU/50010 WE'VE GOT TO SHOW OUR VALUES
trainval/3F2jACWwKdU/50011 SO WE'VE GOT TO FIND A DIFFERENT MECHANISM AND ONE OF THE BEST MECHANISMS I'VE EVER COME ACROSS IS THE VICTIMS OF
trainval/3F2jACWwKdU/50012 SO HOW ARE YOU GOING TO RESPOND TO IT
trainval/3F2jACWwKdU/50013 WE'RE ALL VICTIMS OF TERRORISM
trainval/3F2jACWwKdU/50014 SHE'S GOING TO GIVE UP UNIVERSITY
trainval/3F2jACWwKdU/50015 BUT MISTAKES OF THE PAST ARE INEVITABLE
trainval/3F2jACWwKdU/50016 IT'S HUMAN NATURE
trainval/3F2jACWwKdU/50017 THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE MISTAKES
trainval/3F2jACWwKdU/50018 THEY'RE NOT JUST GOING TO BE SMART
trainval/3F2jACWwKdU/50019 IT'S NOT JUST OUR FLESH AND BLOOD THEY WANT
trainval/3F2jACWwKdU/50020 WHY WAS IT EFFECTIVE
trainval/3F2jACWwKdU/50021 THERE'S OTHER EXAMPLES
trainval/3F2jACWwKdU/50022 A GOOD ONE IS IN SOMALIA
trainval/3F2jACWwKdU/50023 THERE'S A WAR ON PIRACY
trainval/3F2jACWwKdU/50024 IF ANYONE THINKS YOU CAN HAVE A WAR ON PIRACY LIKE A WAR ON TERRORISM AND BEAT IT YOU'RE WRONG
trainval/3F2jACWwKdU/50025 WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THERE IS TURN PIRATES TO FISHERMAN
trainval/3F2jACWwKdU/50027 MAYBE THE ROLLING STONES HAS A PLACE IN THIS
trainval/3F2jACWwKdU/50028 WE MUST FOSTER INNOVATION AS I'VE SAID
trainval/3f5lk3PZh74/50001 YOU AND I WE'VE BECOME INFECTED AND WE NOT EVEN KNOW IT
trainval/3f5lk3PZh74/50002 NOW IMPLICIT BIAS IS DIFFERENT FROM EXPLICIT BIAS
trainval/3f5lk3PZh74/50003 EXPLICIT BIAS IS A BIAS THAT WE KNOW WE HAVE AND WE FREELY ADMIT TO OTHERS
trainval/3f5lk3PZh74/50004 BUT IT IS HARMFUL TO US ALL THE SAME
trainval/3f5lk3PZh74/50005 THINK OF SOMETHING MORE LIKE ZIKA
trainval/3f5lk3PZh74/50006 IT SPREADS QUICKLY
trainval/3f5lk3PZh74/50008 I KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO FOR A MINUTE THINK THAT IT'S OUR OWN BEHAVIOR CONTRIBUTING TO
trainval/3f6xCzKx9CA/50001 THEN YOU HAVE A TOP TWO PERCENT SHOW
trainval/3f6xCzKx9CA/50002 HE MAY HAVE ALSO BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR 22 VERY ENTERTAINING MINUTES BUT NOT VERY MANY OF YOU
trainval/3f6xCzKx9CA/50003 HE WANTS TO ENGINEER SUCCESS
trainval/3f6xCzKx9CA/50004 AND SO WHEN AMAZON IS GIVING OUT FREE STUFF YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE IT RIGHT
trainval/3f6xCzKx9CA/50005 AND ALL OF THAT GOES BACK TO A DECISION THAT ROY HAD TO MAKE ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO
trainval/3f6xCzKx9CA/50006 THEY RECORD WHEN SOMEBODY PRESSES PLAY WHEN SOMEBODY PRESSES PAUSE WHAT PARTS THEY SKIP WHAT PARTS THEY WATCH AGAIN
trainval/3f6xCzKx9CA/50007 SO INSTEAD OF HOLDING A COMPETITION WHAT HE DID AND HIS TEAM OF COURSE WAS THEY LOOKED AT ALL THE DATA THEY
trainval/3f6xCzKx9CA/50008 WHAT KINDS OF SHOWS THEY LIKE WHAT KIND OF PRODUCERS WHAT KIND OF ACTORS
trainval/3f6xCzKx9CA/50009 THAT'S THE TV PRODUCTION COMPANY OF AMAZON
trainval/3f6xCzKx9CA/50010 OK THAT'S GOOD ACTUALLY
trainval/3f6xCzKx9CA/50011 AND THAT'S NOT BECAUSE A COMPANY LIKE MULTI HEALTH SYSTEMS DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH DATA
trainval/3f6xCzKx9CA/50012 EVEN THE MOST DATA SAVVY COMPANIES GET IT WRONG
trainval/3f6xCzKx9CA/50013 IN 2009 GOOGLE ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE ABLE WITH DATA ANALYSIS TO PREDICT OUTBREAKS OF
trainval/3f6xCzKx9CA/50014 AND OF COURSE THAT'S A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE SPACE
trainval/3f6xCzKx9CA/50015 TAKING APART AND PUTTING BACK TOGETHER AGAIN
trainval/3f6xCzKx9CA/50016 THERE'S ANOTHER TOOL THAT CAN DO THAT AND WE ALL HAVE IT AND THAT TOOL IS THE BRAIN
trainval/3f6xCzKx9CA/50017 THEY USE DATA TO FIRST UNDERSTAND LOTS OF PIECES ABOUT THEIR AUDIENCE THAT THEY OTHERWISE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO UNDERSTAND AT THAT
trainval/3f6xCzKx9CA/50018 BUT THAT DOES NOT CHANGE THE BASIC SETUP
trainval/3f6xCzKx9CA/50019 THE FIRST ONE IS YOU TAKE THAT PROBLEM APART INTO ITS BITS AND PIECES SO THAT YOU CAN DEEPLY ANALYZE THOSE BITS AND
trainval/3fM9o72ykww/50001 THERE ARE MANY THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS OF KETONES BECAUSE NEARLY ALL HEALTHY CELLS IN A BODY
trainval/3fM9o72ykww/50002 WHAT'S MOST INTERESTING IS THAT THE SAME LEVEL OF OXYGEN THAT DAMAGED THE CANCER CELLS WAS
trainval/3g968CCd3XQ/50001 AND THIS WAS 60 YEARS AGO NEPAL
trainval/3GFG6Cvy9HQ/50001 I DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER
trainval/3GFG6Cvy9HQ/50002 HIS STORY IS REALLY INCREDIBLE
trainval/3GFG6Cvy9HQ/50003 BUT EVEN MORE THAN THE ART PART OF IT JUST TRAVELING WITH HIM WAS AN EXPERIENCE
trainval/3GFG6Cvy9HQ/50004 YOU DON'T ASK FOR PERMISSION
trainval/3GFG6Cvy9HQ/50005 I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS IS GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL
trainval/3GFG6Cvy9HQ/50006 WE MIGHT NOT EVEN END UP COMPLETING IT
trainval/3GFG6Cvy9HQ/50007 I TOLD HIS STORY AND HE LOVED THAT FACT
trainval/3gSSNHO1dDs/50001 THIS WAS CONNECTING RIGHT
trainval/3gSSNHO1dDs/50002 THIS WAS AT A DISTANCE REALIZING THAT SOMEONE WAS FEELING SOMETHING WANTING TO AFFECT THEM IN A PARTICULAR WAY
trainval/3gSSNHO1dDs/50003 THIS WAS INCREDIBLE THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO DO
trainval/3gSSNHO1dDs/50004 AND SO I SAID LET'S PUT THIS TOGETHER IN AN ALBUM
trainval/3gSSNHO1dDs/50005 AND THE PERSON WHO DIDN'T IT TURNED OUT HAD JUST MOVED TO A NEW CITY AND TAKEN ON A NEW JOB
trainval/3gSSNHO1dDs/50006 SO YOU KNOW PEOPLE WERE WRITING ME AND SAYING HOW'S YOUR NEW JOB
trainval/3gSSNHO1dDs/50007 I WAS LIKE I DON'T KNOW
trainval/3HaBoNSlpHU/50001 I'M SO HAPPY THAT I'M COMING TO THE MEETING TOMORROW
trainval/3HaBoNSlpHU/50002 BUT HOW WOULD I KNOW IF SHE WAS FEELING WELL OR WAS IT JUST ANOTHER BIPOLAR
trainval/3HaBoNSlpHU/50003 I WAS VERY SURPRISED TO SEE THAT SO MANY PEOPLE SHARED MY EXPERIENCE AND FOR THE FIRST TIME
trainval/3HaBoNSlpHU/50004 IT MIGHT TAKE YOU THREE YEARS 10 YEARS OR 20 YEARS UNTIL YOU ARE ABLE TO SPEAK ABOUT
trainval/3icoSeGqQtY/50001 WE THINK YOU HAVE TO LEARN THOSE
trainval/3icoSeGqQtY/50002 AND UNTIL WE CHANGE THAT SINGLE MYTH WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE WIDESPREAD UNDERACHIEVEMENT IN THIS
trainval/3icoSeGqQtY/50003 CAROL DWECK'S RESEARCH ON MINDSET HAS SHOWN US THAT IF YOU BELIEVE IN YOUR UNLIMITED
trainval/3icoSeGqQtY/50004 AND WE WANT STUDENTS TO KNOW THIS
trainval/3icoSeGqQtY/50005 BUT THEY FOUND SOMETHING ELSE THAT WAS PRETTY INCREDIBLE
trainval/3icoSeGqQtY/50006 SO HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE LET'S GET A SHOW OF HANDS HAVE EVER BEEN GIVEN THE IDEA THAT THEY'RE NOT A MATH
trainval/3icoSeGqQtY/50007 I'M GOING DO IT
trainval/3icoSeGqQtY/50008 WE HAVE TO GET THIS OUT TO KIDS
trainval/3icoSeGqQtY/50009 BUT MATHS CLASSROOMS HAVE TO CHANGE IN A LOT OF WAYS
trainval/3icoSeGqQtY/50010 IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT CHANGING MESSAGES FOR KIDS
trainval/3icoSeGqQtY/50011 WE HAVE TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE WHAT HAPPENS IN CLASSROOMS
trainval/3icoSeGqQtY/50012 BUT IT IS FUELED BY A SINGLE MYTH THAT'S OUT THERE IN OUR SOCIETY THAT'S VERY STRONG AND VERY
trainval/3icoSeGqQtY/50013 SO WE TAUGHT THEM ABOUT THE BRAIN GROWING
trainval/3icoSeGqQtY/50014 BEFORE THEY CAME TO US THEY HAD TAKEN A DISTRICT STANDARDIZED TEST
trainval/3icoSeGqQtY/50015 WE GAVE THEM THE SAME TEST AT THE END OF OUR 18 LESSONS AND THEY IMPROVED BY AN AVERAGE OF 50
trainval/3icoSeGqQtY/50016 I'M NOT A MATH PERSON
trainval/3icoSeGqQtY/50017 THEY COULD NAME THE ONE PERSON IN THEIR CLASS WHO WAS A MATH PERSON
trainval/3icoSeGqQtY/50018 WE CHANGED THEIR BELIEFS
trainval/3icoSeGqQtY/50019 WE NEED A REVOLUTION IN MATHS TEACHING
trainval/3icoSeGqQtY/50020 AND ONLY NOW IS THE FULL EXTENT OF THE NEED TO ATTEND TO THAT COMING TO LIGHT
trainval/3ite2QwSU7g/50001 PLEASE REMEMBER THE TIME WHEN YOU WERE PLAYING HIDE AND SEEK WITH YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND YOU WERE
trainval/3ite2QwSU7g/50002 THIRD WITH THE RIGHT USE OF SHARED TECHNOLOGIES AND AN OPEN
trainval/3LmjSv8N8hE/50001 FIRST JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME
trainval/3LmjSv8N8hE/50002 BUT THESE ARE REALLY HIGH PERFORMANCE ATHLETIC ANIMALS
trainval/3ls2SgSAyvk/50001 WE REALIZED THAT SHE WAS BEING BULLIED
trainval/3ls2SgSAyvk/50002 AND YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/3ls2SgSAyvk/50003 AND WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS
trainval/3ls2SgSAyvk/50004 WHO'S GOT THEIR BACK
trainval/3ls2SgSAyvk/50005 PLAY WITH PEOPLE WHO MAKE YOU HAPPY
trainval/3ls2SgSAyvk/50006 THOSE PEOPLE WHO MAKE YOU SAD ALL THE TIME ARE NOT YOUR FRIENDS DARLING
trainval/3ls2SgSAyvk/50007 WHAT HAPPENED THEN
trainval/3ls2SgSAyvk/50008 I THINK IT CAN
trainval/3ls2SgSAyvk/50009 PLAY WITH PEOPLE WHO MAKE YOU HAPPY
trainval/3lxyiS3CGrk/50001 AND SOMETIMES MILITARY INTERVENTION IS NECESSARY
trainval/3lxyiS3CGrk/50002 WE CAN ONLY SOLVE THIS THROUGH A POLITICAL SOLUTION
trainval/3lxyiS3CGrk/50003 EVERYBODY SEEMS TO AGREE WITH THAT
trainval/3lxyiS3CGrk/50004 IT WAS VERY CONTROVERSIAL TO SAY THREE FOUR FIVE YEARS AGO
trainval/3lxyiS3CGrk/50005 AND WE STRUGGLE WITH HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM
trainval/3lxyiS3CGrk/50006 I THINK THAT IS WRONG
trainval/3lxyiS3CGrk/50007 HOW WILL WE EVER BE INTERLOCUTORS
trainval/3lxyiS3CGrk/50008 THAT IF YOU MOVE TOWARDS DEMOCRACY IF YOU MOVE TOWARDS TAKING PART IN
trainval/3lxyiS3CGrk/50009 SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO
trainval/3lxyiS3CGrk/50010 ALL OF A SUDDEN NGOS WERE NOT ONLY STANDING IN THE STREETS CRYING THEIR SLOGANS BUT THEY WERE TAKING THEM
trainval/3lxyiS3CGrk/50011 HOW ARE WE GOING TO SOLVE CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS UNLESS WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE CIVIL SOCIETY AND
trainval/3LzX36sShcs/50001 AND SHE CREATED A DANCE PIECE WHICH THEN PRIME MINISTER NEHRU SAW
trainval/3LzX36sShcs/50002 HE CAME TO TALK TO HER AND SAID WHAT IS THIS ABOUT
trainval/3LzX36sShcs/50003 SO WHY ARE WE NOT DOING SOMETHING TO ACTUALLY ATTEND THAT PROBLEM ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS
trainval/3LzX36sShcs/50004 AND UNLESS THIS IS ACTUALLY INTERNALIZED IT WON'T HAPPEN
trainval/3LzX36sShcs/50005 SO WHAT IS IT THAT WE REQUIRE
trainval/3LzX36sShcs/50006 WHAT IS IT THAT WE NEED
trainval/3LzX36sShcs/50007 WE NEED TO BREAK DOWN OUR VISION OF WHAT PLANNERS ARE OF WHAT THE CORRECT
trainval/3LzX36sShcs/50008 FATHER MOTHER THIS MAN SHALL BE MY WIFE
trainval/3M29BY86bP4/50001 HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE
trainval/3m6dV7Xo3Vc/50001 I THINK ABOUT MY SWEETHEART OR MY CLOSEST FRIENDS OR THE SONGS THAT TRAVEL WITH ME WHEREVER I HAPPEN TO BE
trainval/3m6dV7Xo3Vc/50002 AND THE NUMBER OF US WHO LIVE OUTSIDE THE OLD NATION STATE CATEGORIES IS INCREASING SO QUICKLY
trainval/3m6dV7Xo3Vc/50003 SHE REALIZES THAT SHE PROBABLY HAS MUCH MORE IN COMMON WITH HIM THAN WITH ANYBODY ENTIRELY OF
trainval/3m6dV7Xo3Vc/50004 THAT'S NOT THE POINT
trainval/3MYEtQ5Zdn8/50001 SO THEY COMPARED DREYFUS'S HANDWRITING TO THAT ON THE MEMO AND INCLUDED THAT IT WAS A MATCH
trainval/3MYEtQ5Zdn8/50002 THEY WENT AND SEARCHED DREYFUS'S APARTMENT LOOKING FOR ANY SIGNS OF ESPIONAGE
trainval/3MYEtQ5Zdn8/50003 THEY WENT THROUGH HIS FILES AND THEY DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING
trainval/3MYEtQ5Zdn8/50004 THEY TALKED TO HIS TEACHERS
trainval/3MYEtQ5Zdn8/50005 THEY WERE INTENTIONALLY FRAMING HIM BUT HISTORIANS DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
trainval/3MYEtQ5Zdn8/50006 AND VICE VERSA
trainval/3MYEtQ5Zdn8/50007 IF YOU DON'T SUPPORT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT SAME THING
trainval/3MYEtQ5Zdn8/50008 THEY'RE ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL
trainval/3MYEtQ5Zdn8/50009 HE IS THE AUTHOR OF THE LITTLE PRINCE
trainval/3NdSVi38RM8/50001 WILLIAMS AT UC HASTINGS REPORTED FACING RACIALIZED GENDER BIAS
trainval/3NdSVi38RM8/50002 5 BILLION DOLLAR GALILEO MISSION TO JUPITER TWO HIGH PROFILE SCIENTIFIC
trainval/3NQZOXtc9uo/50001 ARE THERE WORDS IN YOUR TEXTBOOK LIKE LIKE HONAM
trainval/3NQZOXtc9uo/50002 LIKE LIKE AMNIOTIC LOVE
trainval/3NQZOXtc9uo/50003 LIKE UBANI NENTU WATCH HER WALK WITH GRACE
trainval/3NQZOXtc9uo/50004 SOMETHING IN YOU BREAKS THOUGH DOESN'T IT
trainval/3NQZOXtc9uo/50005 EVEN THE STARS STOLEN IN THEIR INFINITE GRACE ONLY SHOW UP AT THE DARKEST POINT OF NIGHT SHOWING
trainval/3NQZOXtc9uo/50006 ME AND YOU WE ARE GOING TO RELEARN WHAT BEAUTY REALLY IS BECAUSE WHO TAUGHT YOU THAT THE VALUE OF A
trainval/3NQZOXtc9uo/50007 YOUR MATH IS DANGEROUSLY WRONG
trainval/3NQZOXtc9uo/50008 DON'T YOU SEE
trainval/3NQZOXtc9uo/50012 AND THIS WAR WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING
trainval/3NQZOXtc9uo/50014 I SEE LUPITA EVERYWHERE I GO STARING AT THE EIFFEL TOWER IN PARIS SITTING AT A SMALL
trainval/3NQZOXtc9uo/50015 WHEN WILL WE BELIEVE
trainval/3NQZOXtc9uo/50016 LOOK AT HOW YOUR HONAM SHINES BROWN GIRL
trainval/3NQZOXtc9uo/50017 WHEN THEY TEACH YOU ABOUT HONAM IN THE BLUE EYED CLASSROOMS OF YOUR SCHOOLS DO THEY EVER ACTUALLY TELL YOU
trainval/3nsoNSLS8RQ/50001 THEY'VE TRIED THIS ACTUALLY
trainval/3nsoNSLS8RQ/50002 IN DALLAS TEXAS THEY HAVE A PROGRAM THAT OFFERS EIGHT YEAR OLDS TWO DOLLARS FOR EACH BOOK THEY
trainval/3nsoNSLS8RQ/50003 AND LET'S SAY IT'S A FOUNDATION
trainval/3nsoNSLS8RQ/50004 THEY WILL PROVIDE THE FUNDS
trainval/3nsoNSLS8RQ/50005 LET'S SEE BY A SHOW OF HANDS
trainval/3nsoNSLS8RQ/50006 IT'S NOT THE RITZ CARLTON
trainval/3nsPcBJAdxI/50001 LIFE HAS BEEN KIND
trainval/3NzgEwye6Uk/50001 THERE IS A WHOLE STREAM OF THOUGHT THAT CALLS ABOUT THE META REALITY OF THINGS HOW THE THINGS THAT WE USE IN FACT
trainval/3NzgEwye6Uk/50002 THIS IS A HAPPY PILLOW
trainval/3NzgEwye6Uk/50003 WELL I WASN'T HAPPY WITH THAT EXPLANATION
trainval/3NzgEwye6Uk/50004 LIKE THERE IS SOME MACHINE THAT DOES THAT
trainval/3NzgEwye6Uk/50005 IN FACT YOU HAVE THE MACHINE DOWN THERE
trainval/3NzgEwye6Uk/50006 HAVE YOU SEEN HOW DIFFICULT THAT IS HOW TOUGH
trainval/3NzgEwye6Uk/50007 THAT'S THE IDEA OF CLIENT SERVER
trainval/3NzgEwye6Uk/50008 WHAT IS DIFFICULT IS TO KEEP DOING OVER AND OVER AGAIN
trainval/3NzgEwye6Uk/50009 I THINK IT'S VERY FITTING FOR A BUSINESS SCHOOL TO TEACH PEOPLE WHY ORGANIZATIONS DON'T CHANGE
trainval/3NzgEwye6Uk/50010 THINGS ARE JUST THINGS
trainval/3NzgEwye6Uk/50011 I HAVE A MIND
trainval/3NzgEwye6Uk/50012 I AM A HUMAN BEING
trainval/3NzgEwye6Uk/50013 THAT WAY YOU CAN ACTUALLY INCREASE THE CHANCES THAT YOUR CARS THAT YOUR CHANGE EFFORTS ARE GOING TO HAVE AN
trainval/3NzgEwye6Uk/50014 WE LIKE THE NEW SO MUCH AND SOMETIMES WE DESPISE THE OLD THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE OLD STILL HAS
trainval/3NzgEwye6Uk/50015 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND BY NOW THAT MANAGING ORGANIZATIONAL FORGETTING IS DEALING WITH THE METAPHOR
trainval/3NzgEwye6Uk/50016 ORGANIZATIONS DON'T FORGET BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK
trainval/3o655tLnik0/50001 DESPITE THE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS I WAS SHOOTING AND EXPERIENCING THEY'D STARTED TO FEEL A LITTLE BIT ORDINARY TO ME
trainval/3OMgvtWNHp4/50001 THE REASON WHY IF I RAN AWAY MY FATHER WILL HAVE A STIGMA PEOPLE WILL BE CALLING HIM THE
trainval/3OMgvtWNHp4/50002 I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
trainval/3OMgvtWNHp4/50003 AS I WENT BACK I STARTED TALKING TO THE MEN TO THE VILLAGE AND MOTHERS AND I SAID I WANT TO GIVE BACK THE WAY I HAD
trainval/3OMgvtWNHp4/50004 WHAT DO YOU NEED
trainval/3OMgvtWNHp4/50005 EVERYBODY WERE TELLING US ANGELENE HAD BEEN MOVING FROM ONE PLACE BECAUSE SHE'S AN ORPHAN SHE HAS NO MOTHER SHE HAS NO FATHER MOVING FROM
trainval/3OMgvtWNHp4/50006 125 GIRLS WILL NOT BE MARRIED WHEN THEY ARE 12 YEARS OLD
trainval/3OMgvtWNHp4/50007 WE ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE
trainval/3OMgvtWNHp4/50008 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/3oXGJmZpzys/50001 EVERYONE IS ON EQUAL FOOTING AND EVERYONE SHARES THE FRUITS OF OUR COLLECTIVE LABOR
trainval/3phTundagzQ/50002 I ALWAYS LIKE TO JOKE WHEN PEOPLE SAY WHAT DOES PEJUTA WICASA MEAN
trainval/3phTundagzQ/50003 I AM VERY FORTUNATE TO COME FROM A FAMILY WITH A LOT OF TRADITIONAL HEALERS
trainval/3phTundagzQ/50004 I WAS REALLY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT MY UNCLES WOULD THINK ABOUT THAT
trainval/3phTundagzQ/50005 BECAUSE I HAVE HEARD ALL THE STORIES OF HOW OUR TRADITIONAL HEALERS MAYBE HAVE NOT BEEN AS RESPECTED AS THEY COULD BE
trainval/3phTundagzQ/50006 BUT ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE HAPPENED
trainval/3phTundagzQ/50007 THEY WERE NOT DISCOURAGING IF ANYTHING THEY WERE VERY ENCOURAGING
trainval/3phTundagzQ/50008 I WAS VERY FORTUNATE I WAS ABLE TO GO TO STANFORD FOR MEDICAL SCHOOL AND I HAVE MY MPH FROM HARVARD
trainval/3phTundagzQ/50009 I HAVE WORKED IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ARENAS OF HEALTH
trainval/3phTundagzQ/50010 BUT WE SAW A HUGE CHANGE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY BECAUSE OF ADVANCES IN SCIENCE
trainval/3phTundagzQ/50011 AND PROBABLY THE BIGGEST SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE THAT WE FOUND IN MODERN SCIENCE IS THE DISCOVERY OF ANTIBIOTICS
trainval/3phTundagzQ/50012 THE REASON IS THAT FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS BACTERIA AND MOLD HAVE COMPETED WITH EACH OTHER
trainval/3phTundagzQ/50013 SO THEY DEVELOPED CHEMICALS TO KILL EACH OTHER
trainval/3phTundagzQ/50015 NOW WHAT IS INTERESTING WHEN I TALK TO MY UNCLES WHO ARE TRADITIONAL HEALERS THEY TALK ABOUT HOW OVER THE YEARS THEY WOULD USE
trainval/3phTundagzQ/50016 DO MULTIPLE CULTURES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EMBRACE WHAT THEY ONCE HAD IN TERMS OF A HEALTHIER LIFESTYLE
trainval/3phTundagzQ/50017 SO HISTORICALLY OUR TRIBE HAS BEEN USING ANTIBIOTICS FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS POTENTIALLY
trainval/3phTundagzQ/50018 I AM SURE MANY OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THIS SYMBOL
trainval/3PQrElyu9HY/50001 AQUINMAY IS NOW THE FIRST PERSON TO COME OUT IN HIS VILLAGE AS GAY BUT NOT THE LAST
trainval/3PQrElyu9HY/50002 THROUGH HER ADVOCACY VALERIA S SCHOOL NOW TEACHES A COURSE ABOUT WOMAN S RIGHTS AND
trainval/3PQrElyu9HY/50003 THE VALIDATION PROJECT CHANGED THEIR LIVES AND IT CHANGED MINE TOO
trainval/3PQrElyu9HY/50004 WHY IS IT THAT EVERY TIME WE THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX WE RE TOLD TO WAIT UNTIL WE RE OLDER
trainval/3PQrElyu9HY/50005 WAIT UNTIL WE HAVE OUR LIFE FIGURED OUT
trainval/3PQrElyu9HY/50006 EVERY DAY I M NOTIFIED OF THE NEWS MY GENERATION IS HEADLINING AND EVERY DAY
trainval/3PQrElyu9HY/50007 IT LL DRAG YOU BY THE HAND AND SCREAM THIS IS IMPORTANT AND THIS IS IMPORTANT
trainval/3PQrElyu9HY/50008 AND YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THIS AND DO THIS
trainval/3PQrElyu9HY/50009 THIS IS WHAT S IMPORTANT
trainval/3PQrElyu9HY/50010 BUT EACH TIME IS A NEW OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO TURN ON YOUR LIGHT AND MAKE THE WORLD A LITTLE BRIGHTER
trainval/3PQrElyu9HY/50011 AT FOURTEEN WHEN I WAS BULLIED SO BRUTALLY I STARTED PRETENDING I WAS SICK SO I WOULDN T HAVE
trainval/3PQrElyu9HY/50012 I TURNED ON MY LIGHT
trainval/3PQrElyu9HY/50013 AT SEVENTEEN WHEN I KISSED A BOY ON A FERRIS WHEEL I REALIZED IF I WAS GOING TO TELL
trainval/3PQrElyu9HY/50014 AND NOW HERE I AM ALMOST EIGHTEEN
trainval/3PQrElyu9HY/50015 I VE TURNED ON MY LIGHT SO MANY TIMES IT S NOT DARK ANYMORE
trainval/3PQrElyu9HY/50016 AS LIFE GOES ON YOU RE GOING TO FIND YOURSELF DROWNING IN THE DARKNESS EVERY SINGLE DAY
trainval/3PQrElyu9HY/50017 5 OF THE POPULATION BUT WE ARE 100 OF THE SOLUTION
trainval/3PQrElyu9HY/50018 ALL YOU VE GOT TO DO IS TO TURN ON YOUR LIGHT
trainval/3q3WOrs8kAM/50001 AND THAT'S HOW LOVE WORKS
trainval/3q3WOrs8kAM/50002 IT'S A POSITIVE FEEDBACK CYCLE
trainval/3q3WOrs8kAM/50003 THE MORE YOU GIVE THE MORE YOU HAVE TO GIVE
trainval/3q3WOrs8kAM/50004 THE MORE YOUR RECEIVE THE MORE YOU WANT TO GIVE
trainval/3q3WOrs8kAM/50005 YOUR FIRST LOGICAL QUESTION IS WHAT IS POLYAMORY
trainval/3q3WOrs8kAM/50006 EMOTIONAL LITERACY IS THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND AND COMMUNICATE ABOUT EMOTIONS BOTH YOUR OWN AND
trainval/3q3WOrs8kAM/50007 THAT REALLY STARTS WITHIN ONESELF
trainval/3q3WOrs8kAM/50009 EACH TIME YOU HAVE TO SIT DOWN WITH YOUR PARTNERS AND SAY
trainval/3q3WOrs8kAM/50010 WHAT DO WE WANT OUT OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS
trainval/3q3WOrs8kAM/50012 ANY KIND OF DIFFERENCE IS MORE ACCEPTABLE IN THE POLYAMOROUS COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE'RE ALREADY SO FAR OUT THERE
trainval/3q3WOrs8kAM/50013 LET ME START RIGHT HERE AND SAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO CONVERT EVERYBODY TO POLYAMORY
trainval/3q3WOrs8kAM/50014 WE MIGHT ACTUALLY GET SOMETHING DONE IN POLITICS IF WE CAN TALK ABOUT THINGS IN A REASONABLE MANNER
trainval/3qRtDnsnSwk/50001 25 YEARS IT TOOK
trainval/3qRtDnsnSwk/50002 IT IS ONLY BY STOPPING THE TRANSMISSION THAT THE WORLD WILL BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH IT
trainval/3qRtDnsnSwk/50004 IN SWEDEN WE HAVE NO CONCURRENCY
trainval/3qRtDnsnSwk/50005 WE HAVE SERIAL MONOGAMY
trainval/3qRtDnsnSwk/50006 VODKA NEW YEAR'S EVE NEW PARTNER FOR THE SPRING
trainval/3qRtDnsnSwk/50007 VODKA MIDSUMMER'S EVE NEW PARTNER FOR THE FALL
trainval/3qRtDnsnSwk/50008 PROBABLY IT'S A COMBINATION OF THIS
trainval/3qRtDnsnSwk/50009 AFTER ALL IF YOU ARE COMPLETELY HEALTHY AND YOU HAVE HETEROSEXUAL SEX THE RISK OF INFECTION IN ONE INTERCOURSE
trainval/3qXLZYXSJSI/50001 YOU SHOULD BE WORKING RIGHT NOW
trainval/3qXLZYXSJSI/50002 YOU'RE NOT DOING IT NOW
trainval/3qyVvDGDGQs/50001 EVERY MUSCLE SEARED IN MY BODY
trainval/3qyVvDGDGQs/50002 AND IF YOU KEEP DOING IT ONCE YOU'VE HIT THAT POINT IT CAN REALLY KEEP YOU STUCK DOING THINGS THAT ARE
trainval/3qyVvDGDGQs/50003 IT WAS THE DAY OF HER EIGHT YEAR OLD DAUGHTER'S RECITAL AND SHE FOUND ARIANA SOBBING HYSTERICALLY ON THE BED
trainval/3qyVvDGDGQs/50004 MARYANNE IN HER WISE WAY SAT DOWN AND RUBBED HER DAUGHTER'S BACK AND SHE SAID IT'S OKAY HONEY YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO
trainval/3qyVvDGDGQs/50005 ARIANA THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND BOLTED UPRIGHT IN BED
trainval/3qyVvDGDGQs/50006 SHE SAID I HAVE TO GO
trainval/3qyVvDGDGQs/50007 AND EITHER CHOICE WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE FOR ARIANA SHE COULD HAVE GONE OR NOT
trainval/3qyVvDGDGQs/50008 WHEN WE GIVE OURSELVES THE CHOICE BETWEEN YES OR NO
trainval/3qyVvDGDGQs/50009 I'M ALSO INSPIRED BY MY COMMITMENT TO HELP WOMEN THRIVE NOT JUST FOR THEMSELVES BUT IN
trainval/3qyVvDGDGQs/50010 IT ISN'T ABOUT DESTINATION IT'S ABOUT NAVIGATING LIFE'S WAVES SO THAT
trainval/3qyVvDGDGQs/50011 ONE QUESTION FOR YOU
trainval/3qyVvDGDGQs/50012 ARE YOU READY TO LEAVE THE STRAIGHT PATH BEHIND
trainval/3QZp6smeSQA/50001 AND THERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF PROJECTS THAT HAVE DELIBERATELY TRIED TO MIMIC ECOSYSTEMS
trainval/3QZp6smeSQA/50002 AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT NATURE OFTEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT AS BEING ALL ABOUT COMPETITION
trainval/3QZp6smeSQA/50004 THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE SEAWATER GREENHOUSE PRODUCES
trainval/3QZp6smeSQA/50005 CSP PRODUCES A LOT OF WASTE HEAT
trainval/3QZp6smeSQA/50006 AND IT TURNS OUT THAT DIFFERENT THINGS CRYSTALLIZE OUT AT DIFFERENT STAGES
trainval/3QZp6smeSQA/50007 AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT
trainval/3QZp6smeSQA/50008 ANTOINE DE SAINT EXUPERY ONCE SAID IF YOU WANT TO BUILD A FLOTILLA OF SHIPS YOU DON'T SIT AROUND TALKING ABOUT CARPENTRY
trainval/3QZp6smeSQA/50009 AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO SO LET'S BE POSITIVE AND LET'S MAKE PROGRESS WITH WHAT COULD BE THE MOST EXCITING PERIOD OF INNOVATION WE'VE
trainval/3rbVQNTzCh8/50001 BUT WHAT THEY ALLOWED US TO DO WAS THEY ALLOWED US TO FOCUS
trainval/3rbVQNTzCh8/50002 THEY ALLOWED US TO DO MORE AMAZING THINGS IN OTHER WAYS
trainval/3rbVQNTzCh8/50003 I FOUND A FEW
trainval/3rbVQNTzCh8/50004 I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THEM TODAY
trainval/3rbVQNTzCh8/50005 BORING PEOPLE ARE UNORIGINAL
trainval/3rbVQNTzCh8/50006 IT WILL NEVER MAKE A MISTAKE
trainval/3rbVQNTzCh8/50007 WE TELL THE CALCULATOR TO DO THE CALCULATING AND WE DO THE ACTUAL MATH BECAUSE WE'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN
trainval/3rbVQNTzCh8/50008 WHEN WE OFF BOARD THAT INFORMATION TO THEM WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN FOCUS ALL OF OUR ATTENTION ALL OF
trainval/3rbVQNTzCh8/50009 SOMETIMES WE ARE SO AFRAID THAT WE DON'T MAKE ANY CHOICE AT ALL AND WE JUST GO WITHOUT
trainval/3rbVQNTzCh8/50010 BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M AFRAID OF AND IT SHOULDN'T BE WHAT ANYONE ELSE IS AFRAID OF EITHER
trainval/3rbVQNTzCh8/50011 WE SHOULD BE AFRAID OF LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY DOING THE THINGS WE LOVE WHERE WE'RE NOT CONSTANTLY
trainval/3SAZ5R2SC88/50001 I ACTUALLY STARTED FIRST GRADE WITH A BIG CAST ALL OVER MY TORSO
trainval/3SdJP2JCSDY/50001 THEY MIGHT FEEL THAT THEY DIDN'T GET THE RIGHT ONE
trainval/3sUWSDHOVn0/50001 I LOVED BEING A RADIO JOURNALIST
trainval/3sUWSDHOVn0/50002 ALMOST EXACTLY FIVE YEARS LATER ON A BEAUTIFUL APRIL DAY
trainval/3sUWSDHOVn0/50003 IT'S THE LONGEST OF THIS KIND IN THE HISTORY OF MODERN WARFARE
trainval/3sUWSDHOVn0/50004 HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED DURING THE WAR IN BOSNIA
trainval/3sUWSDHOVn0/50005 NOW I WAS A REFUGEE
trainval/3sUWSDHOVn0/50006 IF YOU HAVE MET A REFUGEE OR A MIGRANT IN PERSON THAT EXPERIENCE WILL INFORM YOUR VIEWS
trainval/3sUWSDHOVn0/50007 AND IT CAN BE POSITIVE IT CAN BE NEGATIVE
trainval/3sUWSDHOVn0/50008 YES NOT ALL REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS ARE NICE PEOPLE IT'S NOT A PERSONALITY COMPETITION
trainval/3sUWSDHOVn0/50009 OUR BORDERS ARE OUT OF CONTROL
trainval/3sUWSDHOVn0/50010 AND FOR ONCE I AGREE
trainval/3sUWSDHOVn0/50011 IT IS NOT RACIST TO TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION
trainval/3sUWSDHOVn0/50012 WELL THIS WORRIES ME BECAUSE DEHUMANIZATION IS STAGE THREE OF THE EIGHT STAGES OF
trainval/3sUWSDHOVn0/50013 WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT WHILE WE ARE FOCUSING ON THESE IMAGINARY FEARS
trainval/3sUWSDHOVn0/50014 NOW I DON'T GET TO TALK ABOUT FACTS A LOT SO PLEASE INDULGE ME
trainval/3sUWSDHOVn0/50015 LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE FACTS THAT ARE READILY AVAILABLE TO ALL OF US RIGHT NOW AS WELL AS TO JOURNALISTS ON OUR
trainval/3sUWSDHOVn0/50016 THIS IS AN INCREASE FROM 2
trainval/3sUWSDHOVn0/50017 BUT LET ME BE A JOURNALIST FOR A SECOND AGAIN
trainval/3sUWSDHOVn0/50018 THE SOURCE OF MY HOPE ARE BRILLIANT PEOPLE I MEET EVERYDAY REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS AS WELL AS
trainval/3sUWSDHOVn0/50019 WHEN WE DO THAT WHEN WE SEE MIGRATION AS THE FACT OF LIFE
trainval/3sUWSDHOVn0/50020 SO I DECIDED TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT
trainval/3sUWSDHOVn0/50021 WE INVITE OTHER POWERFUL WOMEN TO SHARE THEIR POWER AND TO SUPPORT THEM AND
trainval/3sWTLAS0m9U/50001 MY VERY IDENTITY FELT LIKE IT WAS BEING CHALLENGED AND CALLED INTO QUESTION
trainval/3sWTLAS0m9U/50002 WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THAT
trainval/3sWTLAS0m9U/50003 I DIDN'T COME TO THAT GRAND INSIGHT QUICKLY
trainval/3sWTLAS0m9U/50004 THIS WASN'T HOME YET
trainval/3sWTLAS0m9U/50005 IT DIDN'T HAPPEN ON THAT PLANE OR ON THAT TRIP TO ISRAEL
trainval/3sWTLAS0m9U/50006 IT'S THE LONE GUY IN A WOMEN'S STUDIES CLASS THE LONE WOMAN IN A COMPUTER SCIENCE CLASS THE BUDDING FEMINIST WHOSE TRYING TO
trainval/3sWTLAS0m9U/50007 IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN THAT POWERFUL CRYSTALLIZATION OF ROOT FEELING
trainval/3sZDmOducck/50001 MOTHERS DRESSED IN SARIS SIT AT THE ROADSIDE
trainval/3sZDmOducck/50002 THEY PUT PRESSURE ON CORPORATIONS
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50001 NOBODY WANTS IT THAT WAY
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50002 BUT THAT'S NOT THE LESSON
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50003 BECAUSE THIS RESEARCH IS NOT JUST SCIENTIFIC
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50004 SHE MARRIED WHEN I WAS NINE
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50005 JUST TIME AFTER TIME
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50006 IT'S THE QUESTIONS THE PROBLEM THAT'S HARD TO SEE
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50007 CAN I DO IT
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50008 BUT NO THIS ONE
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50009 WHEN IT COMES TO PERSONAL HABITS IT'S REALLY EASY TO SEE THE PROBLEM
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50010 AND THEY DON'T WANT IT THAT WAY
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50011 AND WHEN SHE STARTED SAYING
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50012 WHAT IS GETTING IN THE WAY OF MY CRUCIAL MOMENT
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50013 I'M A DADDY'S GIRL
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50014 AJ IS LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHEN THEY TRY TO QUIT SMOKING
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50015 SHE HAD TO GO TO THEM AND SAY
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50016 I'M NOT GOING TO GO OUT ON BREAK
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50017 WILL YOU NOT INVITE ME WILL YOU NOT MAKE FUN OF ME WHEN I DON'T
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50018 AND THE THINGS THAT ARE GOOD FOR YOU COST MORE MONEY
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50019 I AM SO CHEAP
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50020 I'M MAKING LIGHT OF THIS A LITTLE BIT
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50021 VITAL BEHAVIOR IS WHAT WE DO
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50022 NOT ALL BEHAVIORS ARE THE SAME
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50023 THE VITAL BEHAVIORS ARE THE ONES CONNECTED TO THE RESULT AND CARRY A LOT OF OTHER BEHAVIORS WITH IT
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50024 SHE WAS EMBARRASSED
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50025 SHE WROTE IT ON A 3X5 CARD AND SHE DIDN'T COMMIT TO STICK TO HER DIET STICK TO HER PLAN
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50026 WHAT SHE SAID WAS
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50027 AND GAINED 440
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50029 I HAD TO MARSHALL ENOUGH OF THESE INFLUENCES
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50030 AND DURING THOSE MOMENTS WE FOUND THAT THIS WORKS FOR ALL ADDICTIONS
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50031 I MADE A PLAN TO CALL MY SISTER
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50032 WHAT WAS THE NEW CRUCIAL MOMENT
trainval/3TXSNu5wTS8/50033 WHY WERE YOU TEMPTED
trainval/3U6tEcIIAIc/50001 WELL THEY WERE RIGHT
trainval/3U6tEcIIAIc/50002 TAKE FOR EXAMPLE STEVE JOBS
trainval/3U6tEcIIAIc/50003 LOOKING BACK NOW I SEE THERE'S A CLEAR MESSAGE TO THIS SONG
trainval/3U6tEcIIAIc/50004 WELL THEY COULD GO FURTHER
trainval/3U6tEcIIAIc/50005 IT'S NOT ENOUGH THAT MANY PEOPLE I KNOW AND MANY OF US IN THIS ROOM PROBABLY HAD THIS OPPORTUNITY
trainval/3UaOl8SYHes/50001 ONCE I SAID THOSE WORDS TO MYSELF QUITE FRANKLY THERE WAS NO SHUTTING ME UP
trainval/3UaOl8SYHes/50002 HE SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER BASICALLY MAKING IT ILLEGAL TO WORK FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IF YOU WERE A HOMOSEXUAL
trainval/3UaOl8SYHes/50003 I TOOK THEM TO EVERYONE EVERYWHERE I POSSIBLY COULD
trainval/3UaOl8SYHes/50004 I GOT A JOB WORKING IN THE FIELD OF ADVERTISING
trainval/3UaOl8SYHes/50005 SO THAT NIGHT WE GOT TOGETHER AND WALKED INTO THAT BAR
trainval/3UaOl8SYHes/50006 BUT I WAS ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES
trainval/3UaOl8SYHes/50007 THEY TAUGHT ME HOW TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT HIV AND AIDS THEY TAUGHT ME HOW TO ADVOCATE FOR
trainval/3UaOl8SYHes/50009 WHY SHOULD WE IGNORE THOSE ONES OR TREAT THOSE IDENTITIES WORSE
trainval/3UaOl8SYHes/50010 I MEAN IS THAT GOING TO HAPPEN
trainval/3UaOl8SYHes/50011 IN MY LIFETIME
trainval/3UaOl8SYHes/50012 I MEAN I DO REMEMBER THAT MY HOME STATE OF WISCONSIN BECAME THE FIRST STATE IN THE NATION TO OFFER
trainval/3uFbJG6tBpI/50001 INDEED WE COULD BE FORGIVEN FOR ASKING OURSELVES
trainval/3UFGqjWcVU8/50001 THE ICE TOO MAKE SOUNDS
trainval/3UFGqjWcVU8/50002 YOU MAY WELL HAVE HEARD THAT A DECREASE IN SEASONAL SEA ICE IS CAUSING LOSS OF HABITAT FOR ANIMALS THAT RELY
trainval/3vJ4SUH38dQ/50001 FROM THERE IT RADIATED AROUND THE PACIFIC
trainval/3vJ4SUH38dQ/50002 ALTHOUGH IT DOES TAKE QUITE A LOT MORE TO KILL A PERSON THAN TO KILL A BUG
trainval/3vJ4SUH38dQ/50003 LET ME EXPLAIN
trainval/3VwxWDVKs8k/50001 WE HAD A LITTLE BOY
trainval/3VwxWDVKs8k/50002 DID IT WORK
trainval/3W4pLOTXybI/50001 I ELEVATED MY THIGHS
trainval/3W4pLOTXybI/50002 BUT MY PRIORITY AND MY FOCUS WAS ALWAYS MY WORK
trainval/3W4pLOTXybI/50003 I LIVED TO WORK
trainval/3W4pLOTXybI/50004 I SURRENDERED MY BODY TO THEM
trainval/3W4pLOTXybI/50005 I HAD DONE ALL I POSSIBLY COULD AND NOW I WAS IN THEIR
trainval/3W4pLOTXybI/50007 DIFFERENCE OF ANY KIND MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THE EXTRAORDINARY
trainval/3W4pLOTXybI/50008 WHAT'S SHIELDED ME FROM HATRED AND WANTING RETRIBUTION WHAT'S GIVEN
trainval/3W4pLOTXybI/50009 AND WHEN WILL WE EMBRACE THE WISDOM OF OUR ERA
trainval/3WMuzhQXJoY/50001 SO I'M ASKING QUESTIONS AND I'M GETTING THEIR FULL LIFE STORY
trainval/3WMuzhQXJoY/50002 THE GROUND ZERO OF THE WAR ON WOMEN
trainval/3WMuzhQXJoY/50003 I DON'T THINK SO
trainval/3WMuzhQXJoY/50004 THEY'RE ALL LYING ABOUT BEING ABUSED
trainval/3WMuzhQXJoY/50005 IT'S ALL A SCAM
trainval/3WMuzhQXJoY/50006 ALL I HEARD WAS HE WAS ACCUSED OF RAPE
trainval/3WMuzhQXJoY/50007 AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
trainval/3WMuzhQXJoY/50008 BUT I UNDERSTAND THEIR MINDSET
trainval/3WMuzhQXJoY/50009 I WAS TOLD THAT MEN'S RIGHTS ACTIVISTS WERE AGAINST WOMEN'S EQUALITY
trainval/3XDdhbrg2kw/50002 IT DIDN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF COLLATERAL
trainval/3XDdhbrg2kw/50004 IT HAS FISH THAT'S ALL
trainval/3XDdhbrg2kw/50005 THAT'S WHY THE PRIME MINISTER WENT ON TELEVISION
trainval/3XDdhbrg2kw/50006 AND MAKING SENSE OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT
trainval/3XDdhbrg2kw/50007 SO WHAT I THOUGHT I'D DO IS IN HONOR OF EMMANUEL IS WHAT I CAN DO IS TO
trainval/3XDdhbrg2kw/50008 YOU KNOW IT INSPIRES US
trainval/3XDdhbrg2kw/50009 300 YEARS AGO HE'D HAVE BEEN BURNT AT THE STAKE FOR THAT
trainval/3XDdhbrg2kw/50010 YESTERDAY DAVID DEUTSCH ANOTHER ONE WHO COVERED MOST OF WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY
trainval/3XDdhbrg2kw/50011 YOUR HOUSE HAS CAUGHT FIRE
trainval/3XDdhbrg2kw/50012 AND WHAT'S MORE YOUR WIFE HAS JUST RUN OFF WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND
trainval/3XDdhbrg2kw/50013 SHE'S RUNNING OUT OF TIME SHE SAID
trainval/3XDdhbrg2kw/50014 AND SHE'S DESPERATE TO FIND MORE EVIDENCE FOR THE LINK
trainval/3XDdhbrg2kw/50015 I JUST THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT
trainval/3XDdhbrg2kw/50016 SO IT'S EXTRAORDINARY
trainval/3XDdhbrg2kw/50017 SO WHEN THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT I HAD TO MAKE A FEW ARRANGEMENTS LET ME TELL YOU
trainval/3XDdhbrg2kw/50018 IT'S A NEW WORLD THAT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE SENSE OF
trainval/3XDdhbrg2kw/50019 WE HAVE A NEW MAN
trainval/3XDdhbrg2kw/50020 AND BEING ENGLISH WHEN I FIRST HEARD THAT I THOUGHT WHAT A LOAD OF COCK
trainval/3XDdhbrg2kw/50021 BUT YOU KNOW HE'S GONE
trainval/3XDdhbrg2kw/50022 NOW HE'S GONE
trainval/3XDdhbrg2kw/50023 THAT'S EIGHT YEARS OF AMERICAN HISTORY EIGHT MINUTES OF MY ACT JUST GONE LIKE THAT
trainval/3XDdhbrg2kw/50024 YOU KNOW IT'S THE END OF AN ERROR SIC
trainval/3XDdhbrg2kw/50025 I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE IT WAS A GREAT ERROR
trainval/3XDdhbrg2kw/50026 THIS WHOLE WHAT BEN BERNANKE HAS SAID THE CHAOTIC UNWINDING OF THE WORLD'S FINANCIAL SYSTEM IT'S
trainval/3XDdhbrg2kw/50027 IT'S RATHER LIKE THAT LINE IN THE FILM AS GOOD AS IT GETS
trainval/3XDdhbrg2kw/50028 SO WHERE DO WE LOOK FOR INSPIRATION
trainval/3YAF5JdsMm8/50001 AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALL WANT TO HAPPEN
trainval/3YAF5JdsMm8/50002 AND SO WHAT I THOUGHT IS JUST TO SHARE WITH YOU HOW I'M DOING MY GROCERIES EVERYDAY
trainval/3YAF5JdsMm8/50003 SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU TONIGHT IS SOME TIPS AND TRICKS
trainval/3YAF5JdsMm8/50004 AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST IT'S ALSO MORE CONVENIENT TO BUY FOOD IN A GROUP
trainval/3YcZ3Zqk0a8/50001 THE CRY OF RAW DATA NOW
trainval/3yfFwDq4R5M/50001 FOR EXAMPLE ONCE I HAD AN AFFAIR WITH CALCULUS THAT LASTED LONGER THAN SOME CELEBRITY MARRIAGES
trainval/3yfFwDq4R5M/50002 YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT I DON'T HAVE MUCH INFLECTION IN MY VOICE
trainval/3yfFwDq4R5M/50003 THAT'S WHY PEOPLE OFTEN CONFUSE ME WITH A GPS
trainval/3yfFwDq4R5M/50004 SHE SAID DO THAT THING YOU KNOW WITH YOUR EYES WHEN YOU'RE FLIRTING WITH GUYS
trainval/3yfFwDq4R5M/50005 MY GOAL IS TO SHIFT PEOPLE'S PERSPECTIVE OF AUTISM AND PEOPLE WITH
trainval/3yfFwDq4R5M/50006 AND SO MANY PEOPLE WITH AUTISM ARE BEING OVERLOOKED EVERY DAY AND THEY'RE BEING TAKEN
trainval/3z1cCT2NP4k/50001 OR IN THE WORDS OF F
trainval/3Z6x5t5A9so/50001 I DIDN'T SEE ABED COMING
trainval/3Z6x5t5A9so/50003 MY SHOES FLEW OFF
trainval/3Z6x5t5A9so/50004 A FRIEND POINTED OUT TO ME THAT ALL OF MY BIG STORIES MIRRORED MY OWN EACH CENTERING ON A LIFE THAT HAD
trainval/3Z6x5t5A9so/50005 BUT WHAT TO GET THE MAN WHO BROKE YOUR FUCKING NECK
trainval/3Z6x5t5A9so/50006 ABED WOULD SAY I'M SORRY
trainval/3Z6x5t5A9so/50007 I THEN BEGAN TO WONDER AS I HAD MANY TIMES BEFORE HOW MY LIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT HAD THIS MAN NOT INJURED ME HAD MY
trainval/3Z6x5t5A9so/50008 BUT I ALSO SAW IN MY REFLECTION THAT HAD ABED NOT INJURED ME I WOULD NOW IN ALL LIKELIHOOD BE A
trainval/3Z6x5t5A9so/50009 I WOULD BE LESS MINDFUL OF TIME AND OF DEATH AND OH I WOULD NOT BE DISABLED WOULD NOT SUFFER THE THOUSAND
trainval/3Z6x5t5A9so/50010 I SUPPOSE THEY WERE TRUE
trainval/3Z6x5t5A9so/50012 IT WAS THIS YOUTH WHO ON MAY 16 1990 HAD BROKEN TWO NECKS INCLUDING MINE AND BRUISED
trainval/3Z6x5t5A9so/50013 NO I WAS QUIET
trainval/3Z6x5t5A9so/50014 I WAS QUIET BECAUSE I HAD NOT COME FOR TRUTH
trainval/3Z6x5t5A9so/50015 AND IT WAS THEN I UNDERSTOOD THAT NO MATTER HOW STARK THE REALITY THE HUMAN BEING FITS IT INTO A NARRATIVE THAT IS
trainval/3Z6x5t5A9so/50016 THE PERPETRATOR BECOMES THE VICTIM
trainval/3Z6x5t5A9so/50017 WHEN ONE MORNING YEARS AFTER THE CRASH I STEPPED ONTO STONE AND THE UNDERSIDE OF MY LEFT FOOT FELT THE FLASH OF
trainval/3Z6x5t5A9so/50018 BUT I DIDN'T SAY THESE THINGS TO ABED
trainval/40Aziot4aao/50001 I'M FEELING VERY HAPPY EVERYDAY
trainval/40ieXxoJwZw/50001 YOU MADE THE RIGHT CALL I'M LISTENING VERY CAREFULLY
trainval/40ieXxoJwZw/50002 WHAT SHOULD IT LOOK LIKE
trainval/40riCqvRoMs/50001 THAT WAS HOW MUCH EFFORT IT
trainval/40riCqvRoMs/50002 WE WERE FAIRLY ALONE ON THIS JOURNEY FOR QUITE A WHILE
trainval/40riCqvRoMs/50003 IT'S AN INCREDIBLE ACCOMPLISHMENT BUT IT'S ONLY THE FIRST STEP
trainval/415VX3QX4cU/50001 AND HE WROTE TO THE ACADEMICIANS IN PARIS TRYING TO EXPLAIN HIS THEORY
trainval/415VX3QX4cU/50002 NOW SYMMETRY IS ALMOST NATURE'S LANGUAGE
trainval/415VX3QX4cU/50003 ARTISTS TOO LOVE TO PLAY AROUND WITH SYMMETRY
trainval/415VX3QX4cU/50004 IT WAS A VERY DELIBERATE ACT
trainval/415VX3QX4cU/50005 SO I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THE CHANCE TO GET YOUR NAME ON A NEW SYMMETRICAL OBJECT WHICH HASN'T BEEN NAMED BEFORE
trainval/415VX3QX4cU/50006 BY THE INDIANS
trainval/415VX3QX4cU/50007 AND THIS ENABLES US TO DISTINGUISH WHY THE SYMMETRIES OF THESE OBJECTS THEY BOTH HAVE SIX SYMMETRIES
trainval/415VX3QX4cU/50008 TAKE A BEER MAT AND ROTATE IT BY A QUARTER OF A TURN THEN FLIP IT
trainval/415VX3QX4cU/50009 IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE CONCEPT OF NUMBER BEING DEVELOPED FOR SYMMETRY
trainval/415VX3QX4cU/50010 I CREATE MATHEMATICAL OBJECTS SYMMETRICAL OBJECTS USING GALOIS' LANGUAGE IN VERY HIGH
trainval/415VX3QX4cU/50011 IF I TOLD YOU 20 OR LESS STAND UP
trainval/43e6eAAeGCs/50001 BECAUSE I LOVE SEEING MY NAME ON TWITTER ESPECIALLY WHEN I SAY SOMETHING DUMB THAT'S FUNNY
trainval/43e6eAAeGCs/50002 SO A BIT OF MY BACKGROUND
trainval/43e6eAAeGCs/50003 THERE'S A SMALL ASTERISK THERE
trainval/43e6eAAeGCs/50004 WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT BITCOIN
trainval/43e6eAAeGCs/50005 WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY THE FIRST IDEA YOU GET WHEN YOU CREATE SOMETHING RIGHT
trainval/43e6eAAeGCs/50006 THERE'S NO CENTRALIZED BANK
trainval/43e6eAAeGCs/50007 I SENT A VALUE OF A CUP OF COFFEE
trainval/43e6eAAeGCs/50008 THIS IS GOING TO OBLITERATE TODAY'S BANKING
trainval/43e6eAAeGCs/50009 EARLY 2011 IT WAS KIND OF LIMITED
trainval/43e6eAAeGCs/50010 YOU CAN BUY THAT WITH BITCOIN TODAY
trainval/43e6eAAeGCs/50011 AND THAT'S IT
trainval/43e6eAAeGCs/50012 IT ROUGHLY DOUBLES THE PROFIT MARGIN
trainval/43e6eAAeGCs/50013 IT HAS SOME WAY TO GO IN TERMS OF USABILITY AND IN PARTICULAR WITH STORING AND KEEPING BITCOIN
trainval/43e6eAAeGCs/50014 WHO OWNS THAT FORTUNE
trainval/43e6eAAeGCs/50015 BUT THEY'RE NOT USING COURTS THEY'RE USING SELF ARBITRATING CONTRACTS WITH ETHEREUM TECHNOLOGY
trainval/43e6eAAeGCs/50016 THIS IS A MATTER OF SEEING THAT TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PIPELINE ARE ACTUALLY OUTCOMPETING THE GOVERNMENT AND THE CORE
trainval/43e6eAAeGCs/50017 BUT THIS IS GOING TO CHANGE
trainval/43e6eAAeGCs/50018 IT WAS RIDICULOUS
trainval/43e6eAAeGCs/50019 AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW
trainval/46w99bZ3WSM/50001 NO NO I DIDN'T WRITE THAT
trainval/46w99bZ3WSM/50002 OF A PIECE OF MUSIC RIGHT
trainval/46w99bZ3WSM/50003 IT'S GOING TO BE A KIND OF A REFRAIN AS WE GO THROUGH THE PRESENTATION
trainval/46w99bZ3WSM/50004 IT'S BEETHOVEN HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT
trainval/46w99bZ3WSM/50005 SO YEAH I GET IT WITH LIKE THE WEIRD APPLIANCES AND THEN THE TOTAL ABSENCE OF
trainval/46wWjKTn4Ac/50001 RECENTLY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP CALLED US ALL RAPISTS THIEVES AND
trainval/46wWjKTn4Ac/50002 AS RECENTLY AS 2014 THEY POLLED 143 COUNTRIES AND THEY ASSIGNED EACH COUNTRY A POSITIVE
trainval/46wWjKTn4Ac/50003 AND THE LOWEST SCORE ANY COUNTRY RECEIVED WAS A 47
trainval/46wWjKTn4Ac/50004 IT IS TIME TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT
trainval/488ZBeaGo6s/50001 AND FOR THE REST OF OUR TIME I'M GOING TO SPEAK IN ONE LANGUAGE THAT IS NATIVE TO
trainval/488ZBeaGo6s/50002 FOLLOW WITH ME AS I GO THROUGH THESE LETTERS
trainval/488ZBeaGo6s/50003 NO RESPONSE NECESSARY
trainval/488ZBeaGo6s/50004 ALL MY BEST WISHES
trainval/488ZBeaGo6s/50005 JUST LIKE I AM NOT GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT LANGUAGE I'M GOING TO BE SPEAKING
trainval/488ZBeaGo6s/50006 MOST OF THE FINGERS THAT ARE DRUNK ARE DIALING ABOUT IT
trainval/488ZBeaGo6s/50007 MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN IT ARE SMILING ABOUT IT
trainval/488ZBeaGo6s/50008 A LIFE WITHOUT IT
trainval/488ZBeaGo6s/50009 AND THE WHOLE STUDENT BODY WOULD VOTE ON WHERE TO HAVE THE PARTY
trainval/488ZBeaGo6s/50010 EVERYTHING THAT YOU FEEL IS SURREAL ABOUT IT
trainval/488ZBeaGo6s/50011 SO I ASK YOU HAS THAT NUMBER THAT YOU HAD IN YOUR HEAD AT THE BEGINNING HAS THAT CHANGED
trainval/48NRknBcz6k/50001 WE KNOW WHAT IS MEANT WHEN WE SAY THAT SOMETHING IS ALIVE
trainval/48NRknBcz6k/50002 3 LIGHT YEARS AWAY FROM US
trainval/48NRknBcz6k/50003 AND THESE SIGNALS CAN TRAVEL IN GREAT DISTANCES AND CARRY A LOT OF INFORMATION
trainval/48oiapTn3K0/50001 WE SHIPPED THE CHAIRS OVER WE HAD A LOT OF FUN GETTING PEOPLE ROLLING AROUND
trainval/48oiapTn3K0/50002 IT WAS AN EASY FIX WE WERE ABLE TO SWAP OUT THE TUBES AND VALVES BUT WE'RE SURE GLAD THAT WE LEARNED THAT LESSON WITH 20 CHAIRS
trainval/48oiapTn3K0/50003 INITIALLY OUR FOCUS HAD BEEN ON THE WORK WE WERE DOING IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
trainval/48oiapTn3K0/50004 WITH THESE TWO PRODUCTS
trainval/48oiapTn3K0/50005 AND DOWN AT THE OTHER HAND THERE'S LOW COST WHEELCHAIRS BUT THEY'RE HARD TO PROPEL IN ROUGH TERRAIN AND THEY BREAK DOWN PRETTY
trainval/48oiapTn3K0/50006 SO THIS HAS BECOME THE MANTRA OF MY RESEARCH GROUP AT MIT
trainval/48oiapTn3K0/50007 WE FOUNDED A SOCIAL ENTERPRISE CALLED GRIT AND WE STARTED TO SHIFT OUR FOCUS FROM THE ENGINEERING AND DESIGN OF OUR
trainval/48oiapTn3K0/50008 BY DOING THIS WE CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF THE 2
trainval/48oiapTn3K0/50009 AND IF WE CAN DO THAT EVERYBODY WINS
trainval/49aWAHqi200/50001 A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS IN RUSSIA WITH MY BAND THE REAL TUESDAY WELD
trainval/49aWAHqi200/50002 IN MUSIC THERE WERE LOTS OF EXPERIMENTAL AMAZING THINGS HAPPENING
trainval/49aWAHqi200/50003 OF COURSE I'M IN POLAND
trainval/49aWAHqi200/50004 SO FOR A WHILE IN RUSSIA JAZZ WAS OK
trainval/49aWAHqi200/50005 THERE WERE RUSSIAN JAZZ BANDS MANY OF THEM VERY POPULAR
trainval/49aWAHqi200/50006 YOU COULD WATCH AMERICAN FILMS WITH JAZZ SOUNDTRACKS IN RUSSIA
trainval/49aWAHqi200/50007 YOUNG PEOPLE LOVED IT OF COURSE
trainval/49aWAHqi200/50009 AND OF COURSE THE STATES COMPLETELY CONTROL THE RECORDING INDUSTRY
trainval/49aWAHqi200/50010 THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY TO GET THIS MUSIC APART FROM IN VERY SMALL QUANTITIES AT
trainval/49aWAHqi200/50011 BUT HE KNEW IT WAS FORBIDDEN
trainval/49aWAHqi200/50012 FOR A FEW RUBLES PEOPLE COULD COME IN AND USE A MICROPHONE TO MAKE A RECORDING OF THEIR VOICE
trainval/49aWAHqi200/50013 THEY MOVED OVER TO THESE GUYS
trainval/49aWAHqi200/50014 THEY BECAME SO BUSY THEY GOT A FRIEND INVOLVED
trainval/49aWAHqi200/50015 THEY CALLED THEMSELVES THE GOLDEN DOG GANG
trainval/49aWAHqi200/50016 HOW TO RECORD ONTO X RAYS
trainval/49aWAHqi200/50017 OTHER PEOPLE IN LENINGRAD STARTED TO DO IT TOO
trainval/49aWAHqi200/50018 HE WAS AN AUDIOPHILE HE WAS A MUSIC LOVER
trainval/49aWAHqi200/50019 UNFORTUNATELY HE WAS CAUGHT AGAIN
trainval/4AaSUyfNN4c/50001 IT'S CALLED FULL SPECTRUM
trainval/4AaSUyfNN4c/50002 SO IT WAS TESTING AGAIN
trainval/4AUSqB0RVNY/50001 I DID STUDY THEOLOGY
trainval/4AUSqB0RVNY/50002 I'M NOT HELPING THEM AVOID DOING THE WRONG THINGS THEY ARE SMART ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IN THEIR BUSINESS
trainval/4AUSqB0RVNY/50003 THAT MAKES A LITTLE BUMP ON YOUR BMP
trainval/4AUSqB0RVNY/50004 WE MAY NOT KNOW HOW OR WHAT BUT IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS
trainval/4AUSqB0RVNY/50005 AND I TELL THEM YOU CAN'T
trainval/4AUSqB0RVNY/50006 IT'S A 50 50 CHANCE RIGHT
trainval/4AUSqB0RVNY/50007 WHAT DID I ASK YOU TO DO
trainval/4AUSqB0RVNY/50008 WE THINK INFORMATION IS POWER
trainval/4AUSqB0RVNY/50009 SUPPOSE I HAD SAID
trainval/4B2qC7PIHxs/50001 10 OF ITS POPULATION MURDERED WITH MORE THAN HALF OF ITS POPULATION STILL LIVING IN
trainval/4B2qC7PIHxs/50002 SOME OF MY HAPPIEST CHILDHOOD MEMORIES WERE SIMPLY GETTING TO COME HOME EVERY DAY FROM SCHOOL TO BE GIVEN A
trainval/4BaJ8zS49v4/50001 THAT'S BEEN DONE
trainval/4bHO8NZwmIg/50001 HOW ARE WE GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
trainval/4bHO8NZwmIg/50002 WHAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE
trainval/4bHO8NZwmIg/50003 WHAT TIME IS AVAILABLE
trainval/4bHO8NZwmIg/50004 THE BIGGEST ONE WAS THAT THE CO2 LEVEL INSIDE THE CAPSULE BEGAN TO INCREASE
trainval/4bHO8NZwmIg/50005 I AM A BIT OF A SCIENCE NERD SO I DON'T MIND TALKING ABOUT THIS STUFF
trainval/4bHO8NZwmIg/50007 WE WANT NEW IDEAS
trainval/4bHO8NZwmIg/50008 PEOPLE ARE THROWING OUT IDEAS
trainval/4bHO8NZwmIg/50009 WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THAT ACTUALLY DID EXIST
trainval/4bHO8NZwmIg/50010 AND I WAS LIKE WELL NO
trainval/4bHO8NZwmIg/50011 I DON'T THINK ANYONE CARED
trainval/4bHO8NZwmIg/50012 HE PUT THE US REPUTATION ON THE LINE
trainval/4bHO8NZwmIg/50013 THAT WAS WHAT WAS IMPORTANT
trainval/4bHO8NZwmIg/50014 WE'RE GOING TO TALK IT THROUGH
trainval/4bHO8NZwmIg/50015 LET'S FIGURE OUT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE
trainval/4bHO8NZwmIg/50016 THEY HAD A DEADLINE
trainval/4bHO8NZwmIg/50017 PEOPLE GO TO PARKS THEY BRING FOOD WITH THEM TO THE PARK AND HAVE A PICNIC
trainval/4bHO8NZwmIg/50018 IT'S KIND OF LIKE AN INDOOR PICNIC
trainval/4bHO8NZwmIg/50019 IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING
trainval/4bHO8NZwmIg/50020 THEY HAD A DEADLINE THAT INVOLVED ACTUAL DEATH
trainval/4bHO8NZwmIg/50021 MAYBE THE WAITERS COULD SING
trainval/4bHO8NZwmIg/50022 ACTUALLY MAYBE PEOPLE COULD SING
trainval/4bHO8NZwmIg/50023 THEY WERE HOPING AND PRAYING
trainval/4bHO8NZwmIg/50024 I RARELY WORK ALONE
trainval/4bHO8NZwmIg/50025 I RARELY HAVE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS BY MYSELF
trainval/4bHO8NZwmIg/50026 I WORK WITH A TEAM
trainval/4bHO8NZwmIg/50027 WE'RE VERY SIMILAR IN LOTS OF WAYS
trainval/4bHO8NZwmIg/50028 WE HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS SOMETIMES
trainval/4bsiMd1zQ3s/50001 SO I WILL TRY TO SHOW YOU THAT TODAY
trainval/4bsiMd1zQ3s/50002 THESE ARE THOSE WHO CONFORM THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SO FOCUSED ON KEEPING THEIR PICTURE PRETTY
trainval/4bsiMd1zQ3s/50003 IN FACT IT'S THE RUBIK'S CUBE THAT SHOW US THAT PROGRESS CANNOT BE MADE WITHOUT TWISTING THE GEARS
trainval/4bsiMd1zQ3s/50004 BUT WE'LL COMEBACK TO THAT LATER SO TRY TO STICK WITH ME
trainval/4bsiMd1zQ3s/50005 WITHOUT TAKING THE CHANCE OF RUINING SOME OF WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE IN ORDER TO PROGRESS FURTHER
trainval/4bsiMd1zQ3s/50006 BUT IF YOU'VE THE ABILITY TO PERSEVERE AND FIND WHAT'S TRULY UNIQUE TO YOU AND START
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50001 THE RELATIONSHIP WITH HER HUSBAND ISN'T WHAT IT SHOULD BE
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50002 AND SHE REALLY PAINTS A PICTURE OF SOMEONE THAT'S JUST GETTING BY SOMEONE THAT'S JUST DOING THE MINIMAL SOMEONE THAT JUST IS
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50003 IT CAN TOTALLY CHANGE OUR SOCIETY
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50004 AND WHEN SHE COMES IN SHE HOPES THAT WHEN SHE SPRINKLES IT ON HER FOOD TONIGHT SHE ACTUALLY WILL EAT A LITTLE
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50005 I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I LOVE IT
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50006 CAN I FIX WHAT'S WRONG
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50007 A VERY UNIQUE GROUP
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50008 SHE'S LOST 75 POUNDS ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50009 I THOUGHT OKAY I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50010 I WAS ABLE TO REALLY STUDY WHY THESE BEHAVIORS STICK IN THESE PEOPLE WHEN THEY DON'T STICK IN OTHER
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50011 THEY'VE DECIDED THAT THESE LIFESTYLES MEAN SO MUCH MORE
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50012 THEY'VE TIED IT TO A HIGHER PURPOSE
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50013 THEY'VE TIED IT TO SOMETHING THAT THEY REALLY VALUE
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50014 THEY ALL COME TO MY OFFICE AND THEY WANT TO KNOW WHY
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50015 WHAT I FOUND ACTUALLY CHANGED THE COURSE OF MY CAREER
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50016 SO WHAT DID WE LEARN
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50017 NO ONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT WEIGHT LOSS MAINTENANCE NO ONE WANTS TO PREPARE FOR WEIGHT LOSS MAINTENANCE AND NO ONE IS GOING TO BUY OR USE A
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50018 AND PART OF THIS I THINK IS BECAUSE PEOPLE REALLY LIKE TO LOSE WEIGHT
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50019 YOU LOOK WONDERFUL
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50020 AND IT'S YOUR BODY AND MIND
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50021 THEY'RE THE ONES THAT NO ONE CAN DO THIS
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50022 IT CREATES WHAT WE CALL A METABOLIC FLEXIBILITY AND IT REALLY ALLOWS YOU TO BE ABLE TO EAT AND MATCH WHAT YOU'RE BURNING
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50023 SO IN COLORADO WE ALSO HAVE A GREAT MINDSET
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50024 BUT IN COLORADO GUESS WHAT
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50025 LASTLY YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE IT EASY
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50026 MAINTAINING THE WEIGHT LOSS IS HARD
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50027 BUT IT DOES
trainval/4BwSMSCFdu0/50028 WHEN YOUR KIDS HANG AROUND PEOPLE THAT SMOKE GUESS WHAT HAPPENS
trainval/4BZuWrdCS9Q/50001 AFTER TWO MINUTES I TAKE MY EYES OFF HER AND SHE'S ON HER PHONE
trainval/4BZuWrdCS9Q/50002 WHAT WAS I THINKING
trainval/4BZuWrdCS9Q/50003 WHY SHOULD SHE LIKE THE MUSIC
trainval/4BZuWrdCS9Q/50005 I REALLY WOULD LOVE TO CONNECT TO HER
trainval/4BZuWrdCS9Q/50007 OF COURSE IT MATTERS
trainval/4BZuWrdCS9Q/50008 WE NEED A LOT OF COURAGE
trainval/4BZuWrdCS9Q/50009 AND YET WE ALL SUFFER FROM SELF DOUBT
trainval/4BZuWrdCS9Q/50010 WE TAKE A MAGNIFYING GLASS AND WE LOOK AT OUR BEHAVIORS
trainval/4BZuWrdCS9Q/50011 WE KNOW WHO WE ARE
trainval/4c1lqFXHvqI/50001 NOW IT'S NOT THAT THESE THINGS ARE INHERENTLY UNSEEABLE
trainval/4c1lqFXHvqI/50002 EVERYTHING IS ABOUT SMELL FOR YOU
trainval/4c1lqFXHvqI/50003 SO I CALL THIS THE P
trainval/4c1lqFXHvqI/50004 THERE ARE SO MANY POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS FOR THIS
trainval/4c1lqFXHvqI/50005 ARE YOU READY FOR THIS
trainval/4ef6KJ7vfIw/50001 I MEAN WHY WE ARE MAKING SO MUCH FUSS
trainval/4ef6KJ7vfIw/50003 THESE ARE NOT FANTASIES
trainval/4ef6KJ7vfIw/50004 IT IS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE
trainval/4EUAMe2ixCI/50001 FOR THE COMPANY
trainval/4EUAMe2ixCI/50002 5 TO ONE HE SAID
trainval/4EUAMe2ixCI/50003 BEST IN THE BUSINESS
trainval/4EUAMe2ixCI/50004 I SAID MIGUEL WHAT MAKES YOUR FISH TASTE SO GOOD
trainval/4EUAMe2ixCI/50005 THE PLANT BIOMASS THE PHYTOPLANKTON THE ZOOPLANKTON IT'S WHAT FEEDS THE FISH
trainval/4EUAMe2ixCI/50006 I ALMOST NEVER COOK WITH IT
trainval/4EUAMe2ixCI/50007 I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT FISH
trainval/4fyvDMFriRI/50001 BUT THE BIGGEST THING THAT WE NEED IS YOUR SUPPORT
trainval/4fyvDMFriRI/50002 I WAS OUT WALKING THE TRACK THE OTHER DAY AND I OVERHEARD A FELLOW PRISONER TELLING HIS FRIEND HOW THIS IS HIS SIXTH TIME IN
trainval/4fyvDMFriRI/50003 NOR IS IT SO DIFFERENT FROM THE SITUATION THAT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF OTHERS FIND THEMSELVES IN
trainval/4fyvDMFriRI/50004 ACCORDING TO THE PEW CENTER ON THE STATES 2011 REPORT NEARLY 45 OF PEOPLE
trainval/4fyvDMFriRI/50005 OF COURSE WE CAN ONLY GAIN THESE THINGS TROUGH INDIVIDUAL HARD WORK
trainval/4fyvDMFriRI/50006 WE ALL NOW THAT ENTERING THE JOB MARKET IS CHALLENGING
trainval/4fyvDMFriRI/50007 THE PDC EFFECT HAD WON THAT FIRST ROUND
trainval/4fyvDMFriRI/50008 I WAS DETERMINED TO WIN THE SECOND
trainval/4fyvDMFriRI/50009 I WILL NEVER FORGET IT
trainval/4fyvDMFriRI/50010 UNIVERSITY BEYOND BARS HAS MADE A GREAT START WITH AN INCREDIBLE IDEA
trainval/4fyvDMFriRI/50011 AND THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES
trainval/4fyvDMFriRI/50012 ONE THAT HAS AN ACADEMIC PATHWAY THAT OFFERS DEGREES
trainval/4fyvDMFriRI/50013 THAT'S SOME POWERFUL FOOD FOR THOUGHT
trainval/4fyvDMFriRI/50014 THE VAST MAJORITY OF US PRISONERS WILL BE RELEASED AT SOME POINT
trainval/4fyvDMFriRI/50015 5 MILLION PEOPLE WERE RELEASED FROM PRISON IN THE UNITED STATES
trainval/4fyvDMFriRI/50016 A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE DEGREE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON COSTS ALMOST THE SAME AS 1 YEAR OF
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50001 AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THAT LACK OF AWARENESS OF NUMBERS PERVADES ALL KINDS OF ACTIONS WE TAKE AND
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50002 YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT RIGHT
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50003 WHEN YOU DO THE MATH YOU START TO SEE HOW THINGS PILE UP
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50004 AND WHAT IS THE MATH HERE
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50005 IT REALLY STARTS TO RACK UP
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50006 THERE'RE OVER 3000 COUNTY COURT HOUSES AROUND THE COUNTRY ALL OF THEM WITH PEOPLE SITTING FOR HOURS MOSTLY
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50007 IF YOU HAVE A JOB THE MARKET HAS PUT A VALUE ON THAT
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50008 IF YOU'RE A FAMILY MEMBER CARING FOR CHILD OR AN AGING PARENT YOU'RE PRODUCING SOMETHING THERE'S A VALUE
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50009 VOLUNTEERS HAVE VALUE
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50010 EVERYBODY'S TIME IS WORTH SOMETHING
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50011 THAT FRACTION OF A GALLON IS NOT THE SWING VOTE HERE
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50012 IT'S MULTIPLYING YOUR TIME BY THE DOLLARS PER HOUR
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50013 CHARITIES ARE HAPPY TO ASK FOR OUR TIME TO HELP THEM FUND RAISE RIGHT
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50014 OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A VALUE TO VOLUNTEERING
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50015 AND THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF NUMBERS THAT WHISTLE BY US ALL THE TIME THAT WE ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT IT
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50016 BUT WHY DON'T WE THINK ABOUT IT
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50017 WE NEVER POSSESS SOME OF THAT MONEY TO BEGIN WITH SO WE DON'T HAVE TO HAND IT BACK
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50018 WE DON'T SENSE HOW THE NUMBERS PILE UP
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50019 AND THAT IS BECAUSE WE DON'T SEE HOW SMALL NUMBERS PILE UP INTO THE BIG ONES WE DON'T SEE HOW SMALL NUMBERS
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50020 AND I WAS STUNNED BY WHAT I FOUND
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50021 THE KIDS KEEP GETTING BIGGER AND DIRTIER
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50022 WE JUST KEEP DOING MORE LAUNDRY
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50023 AND THAT'S WHAT WAS DRIVING IT
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50024 SO WHAT'S THE MATH WE TALK ABOUT HERE
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50025 HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT FRACTIONS
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50026 JUST UNDERSTANDING PARTS OF THE WHOLE
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50027 BECAUSE TAKING ONE FIFTH MAKES US NERVOUS
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50028 THEY'RE BEING READ TO SOMETIMES 10000 MORE HOURS BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS KNOW TO DO THAT AND CAN AFFORD TO
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50029 50 HOURS OF TEST PREP IS NOT GOING TO TURN IT AROUND
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50030 AND SOMETIMES WITH THE BEST OF INTENTIONS
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50031 TEST PREP IS ALL THAT'S LEFT
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50032 THAT'S WHY IT'S SO ADMIRABLE THAT SAL KHAN AT KHAN ACADEMY AND DAVID COLEMAN AT THE COLLEGE BOARD ARE WORKING TO HAVE
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50033 LOOK AT THE VOLUNTEERING WORLD
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50034 NOT EVEN JUST TO DO WELL ON THIS TEST BUT ACTUALLY TO LEARN THE SKILLS
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50035 IF WE ARE AWARE OF THAT WE CAN MAKE THE BETTER DECISIONS
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50036 AND IN MOST CASES THE NUMBERS ARE ALL OUT THERE WAITING FOR US
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50037 WE JUST HAVE TO DO THE MATH
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50038 BECAUSE THIS'S HOW WE TURN AROUND SOCIETY
trainval/4GKTEDqbQIw/50039 SO HOW DO WE TURN THIS AROUND
trainval/4jBB5iibKy0/50002 NO ONE HAD EVER DONE THIS
trainval/4jBB5iibKy0/50003 I WAS 26 AT THE TIME
trainval/4jBB5iibKy0/50004 I REMEMBER SITTING THERE LOOKING DOWN AT MY SLEDGE
trainval/4jBB5iibKy0/50005 PART OF ME FELT QUITE PROUD OF MYSELF BUT MOSTLY I WAS JUST UTTERLY TERRIFIED
trainval/4jBB5iibKy0/50006 MINUS 50 WAS THE COLDEST
trainval/4jBB5iibKy0/50007 MALLORY POSTULATED THAT THERE IS SOMETHING IN MAN THAT RESPONDS TO THE CHALLENGE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND I WONDER
trainval/4jBB5iibKy0/50008 SCOTT'S TEAM WERE ON FOOT ALL FIVE OF THEM WEARING HARNESSES AND DRAGGING AROUND SLEDGES AND THEY ARRIVED AT THE POLE TO FIND THE
trainval/4jBB5iibKy0/50009 IN LIFE WE ALL HAVE TEMPESTS TO RIDE AND POLES TO WALK TO AND I THINK METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING AT LEAST WE COULD ALL
trainval/4jUdCy6Vghw/50001 WHAT CLUES DID I HAVE THAT GUIDED ME IN MY QUEST
trainval/4jUdCy6Vghw/50002 WE ENJOYED SCHOOL BUT WE ENJOYED VACATIONS MORE
trainval/4jUdCy6Vghw/50003 SCOTT WAS A NORMAL KID VERY BRIGHT IN FACT A BOY GENIUS
trainval/4jUdCy6Vghw/50004 THE OBVIOUS DIFFERENCE
trainval/4jUdCy6Vghw/50005 HE WAS A MALE AND I WAS A FEMALE
trainval/4jUdCy6Vghw/50006 SO THIS LED TO MY CURIOSITY AROUND SEX DIFFERENCES IN SCHIZOPHRENIA
trainval/4jUdCy6Vghw/50007 MALES TEND TO GET SCHIZOPHRENIA EARLIER ON IN LIFE BE MORE TREATMENT RESISTANT AND HAVE MORE SEVERE
trainval/4jUdCy6Vghw/50008 TOM AND I AGREED THAT WE WANT TO STIMULATE THE OESTROGEN RECEPTOR
trainval/4jUdCy6Vghw/50009 TOM AND I WROTE OUR FIRST FEDERAL GRANT AND OUR CLINICAL TRIAL WAS BORN
trainval/4jUdCy6Vghw/50010 AND I IMAGINED HIM BEING ABLE TO PURSUE HIS INTEREST IN MATH AND ENGINEERING
trainval/4jUdCy6Vghw/50011 IT'S OUR FAMILY'S TRADITION TO GO AROUND THE TABLE BEFORE WE EAT AND SAY WHAT WE ARE THANKFUL FOR
trainval/4jUdCy6Vghw/50012 I FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW THE OESTROGEN RECEPTOR WAS BROKEN WHAT A
trainval/4KhnSz9FPmU/50001 I MEAN GAYS HAVE 80 FEWER KIDS THAN HETEROSEXUALS
trainval/4KhnSz9FPmU/50002 THIS IS A TRAIT THAT OUGHT TO GO EXTINCT IN A FEW GENERATIONS BUT DOWN THROUGH RECORDED HISTORY IN EVERY
trainval/4KhnSz9FPmU/50003 THANKFULLY THE SEXUAL MINORITY THESE DAYS HAVE MANY OPTIONS FOR HAVING KIDS OF THEIR OWN AND I HAVE A
trainval/4KhnSz9FPmU/50004 BUT THESE DAYS OPEN HOMOPHOBIA IS BEING REPLACED BY MORE OF A SUBTLE HETEROSEXISM WHERE PEOPLE IN THE
trainval/4KhnSz9FPmU/50005 THAT'S COMPLETELY UNTRUE
trainval/4KhnSz9FPmU/50006 WHAT IS AGAINST THE ORDER OF NATURE IS THE ONGOING PERSECUTION OF THE SEXUAL MINORITY
trainval/4l3Kj3hVSVY/50001 THE ANTIBIOTIC PRODUCERS THAT'S ONE WEAPON
trainval/4l3Kj3hVSVY/50002 OUR LITTLE MINIATURE DINOSAURS
trainval/4l3Kj3hVSVY/50003 LAST NIGHT I WENT ONLINE AND DID SOME RESEARCH
trainval/4Lb5LSVEm34/50001 IT'S QUITE INCREDIBLE
trainval/4Lb5LSVEm34/50002 I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY
trainval/4Lb5LSVEm34/50003 NOT THE FRONT THE SIDES
trainval/4Lb5LSVEm34/50004 ONCE YOU LEARN THEM YOU CAN DO THIS AT YOUR DESKS
trainval/4lzs5wpLkeA/50001 SO THE CONCEPT THAT HEART FAT CAUSES HEART DISEASE IS COMPLETELY BOGUS
trainval/4lzs5wpLkeA/50002 IT ALWAYS PREVAILS
trainval/4lzs5wpLkeA/50003 SO AIM TO BE ON THE SIDE OF THE TRUTH
trainval/4mFzIumKKsc/50001 IT WAS ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH THIS PROCESS THAT I STARTED TO NOTICE A COMMON THEME AMONG MANY OF MY CLIENTS
trainval/4mFzIumKKsc/50002 REGARDLESS OF WHERE I WORKED OR WHAT MY CLIENTS LOOKED LIKE SO MANY OF THEM WERE LIVING WITH INSTANCES OR
trainval/4mFzIumKKsc/50003 THERAPISTS ARE TRAINED TO LISTEN TO THEIR CLIENTS
trainval/4mFzIumKKsc/50004 THIS COMES MORE EASILY AND MORE QUICKLY FOR SOME CLIENTS THAN IT DOES FOR OTHERS
trainval/4mFzIumKKsc/50005 2 OR 3 TIMES A YEAR I ATTEND NATIONAL CONFERENCES RELATED TO THIS TOPIC AND THE GENDER SPLIT AT THESE
trainval/4mFzIumKKsc/50006 WE DO IT BY MAKING IT RELATABLE
trainval/4mFzIumKKsc/50007 HOW DO WE ENGAGE MORE MAN IN THE PREVENTION OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
trainval/4mFzIumKKsc/50008 LET'S START WITH DAY TO DAY THINGS
trainval/4mFzIumKKsc/50009 DO YOU AUTOMATICALLY BECOME DEFENSIVE WHEN YOU HEAR DISCUSSIONS AROUND MALE PRIVILEGE
trainval/4mFzIumKKsc/50010 A SIBLING A FRIEND A ROOMMATE
trainval/4mFzIumKKsc/50011 THERE'S A GROUNDBREAKING RESEARCH ON THIS THAT COMES FROM DR REBECCA CAMPBELL
trainval/4mFzIumKKsc/50012 SO AS I POSED THESE QUESTIONS I'M POSING THEM FOR EVERYONE
trainval/4mFzIumKKsc/50013 IF THE VICTIM IS CARED FOR AND SUPPORTED THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO SHOW SYMPTOMS OF PTSD AND
trainval/4mFzIumKKsc/50014 BUT THE QUESTION SHOULD NOT BE
trainval/4mFzIumKKsc/50015 THE QUESTION SHOULD BE
trainval/4mFzIumKKsc/50016 WHEN IT COMES UP HOW DO YOU TALK ABOUT RAPE
trainval/4mFzIumKKsc/50017 SO THIS IS A CALL TO ACTION FOR MEN TO JOIN THE RANKS
trainval/4mFzIumKKsc/50018 TO STRENGTHEN OUR TEAM OF ALLIES
trainval/4mFzIumKKsc/50019 AND IF SO HOW DO YOU DO IT
trainval/4mJ1aHFPS1M/50001 EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN EGYPT THE REVOLUTION IN EGYPT
trainval/4mJ1aHFPS1M/50002 WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT IS THIS WEBSITE
trainval/4mJ1aHFPS1M/50003 FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE REALLY INTERESTING THINGS THAT SHE DOES OR SHE USED TO DO THROUGH THE BLOG IS HIGHLIGHT CASES WHERE
trainval/4mJ1aHFPS1M/50005 IMAGINE A WORLD WITHOUT FREE KNOWLEDGE
trainval/4mJ1aHFPS1M/50006 GAY LESBIAN BI TRANSGENDER OR STRAIGHT WE NEED YOU TO GO ALL OUT TO BUILD THIS HISTORIC MOVEMENT FOR
trainval/4mJ1aHFPS1M/50007 WILL YOU JOIN US
trainval/4mJ1aHFPS1M/50008 GLOBALGIVING THEY COME REGULARLY TO INDIA AS WELL CONDUCTING WORKSHOPS
trainval/4mJ1aHFPS1M/50009 AGAIN WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TERMS OF HOW INFORMATION IS BEING CURTAILED IN WAYS THAT A LOT OF US
trainval/4mJ1aHFPS1M/50010 AND THIS IS SOMETHING YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT
trainval/4N5N0pQUFbI/50001 I THINK THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR BOTH THE HUMANITARIAN ACTORS AND PEOPLE FROM THE MEDIA PEOPLE LIKE ME
trainval/4N5N0pQUFbI/50002 SO THIS GOES BACK TO MY FIRST QUESTION
trainval/4N5N0pQUFbI/50003 ILLUSTRATIONS CAN BE TOUCHING
trainval/4N5N0pQUFbI/50004 AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO TOUCH PEOPLE
trainval/4O2JKS94g3Y/50001 AND I GOT TOLD TO CONCENTRATE ALL THE TIME
trainval/4O2JKS94g3Y/50002 I'D BE A BETTER BALLET DANCER
trainval/4O2JKS94g3Y/50003 WHETHER IT'S POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE IT DOESN'T MATTER
trainval/4O2JKS94g3Y/50004 CHILDREN DON'T NEED TO BE DRUGGED
trainval/4O2JKS94g3Y/50005 BUT MOSTLY NO
trainval/4O2JKS94g3Y/50006 HOW DO I KNOW YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT IT
trainval/4O2JKS94g3Y/50007 AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS ALL DAY
trainval/4O2JKS94g3Y/50008 WE PRACTICE THIS BY DOING ONE THING AT A TIME THROUGHOUT THE DAY
trainval/4O2JKS94g3Y/50009 IT DRIFTS AWAY BRING IT BACK
trainval/4oFGmxZ2nqE/50001 SO HE SAW AT FIRST HAND JUST HOW HORRIFIC LIFE IS WITHOUT
trainval/4oFGmxZ2nqE/50002 HE IMAGINES WHAT THE WORLD WOULD BE LIKE WITHOUT A GOVERNMENT WHERE EVERYONE IS EQUAL
trainval/4oFGmxZ2nqE/50003 AND THE THIRD REASON THAT HOBBES GIVES FOR WHY THE STATE OF NATURE IS A STATE OF WAR IS THAT THERE ARE SOME OF
trainval/4oFGmxZ2nqE/50004 HUMAN BEINGS DON'T LIKE TO BE TOLD WHAT TO DO WE'RE PROUD CREATURES WE THINK WE KNOW
trainval/4RSgUhgg70Q/50001 SHE WAS TRYING TO ENERGIZE AND DETOXIFY HER BODY
trainval/4RSgUhgg70Q/50002 THAT MEANS MORE PEOPLE ARE GETTING TREATED
trainval/4RSgUhgg70Q/50003 THAT MEANS WE'RE DECREASING STIGMA
trainval/4RSgUhgg70Q/50004 THIS BRAND NEW FOOD CALLED CORN
trainval/4Rtfi4MSafA/50001 CITIES ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE COSTING A LOT MORE MONEY
trainval/4Rtfi4MSafA/50002 WHEN YOU HAVE A SMART PERSON AND YOU HAVE SMART INFRASTRUCTURE NOW YOU CAN DEVELOP INNOVATION
trainval/4Rtfi4MSafA/50003 SO WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT
trainval/4Rtfi4MSafA/50004 ACTUALLY IT'S THE INTERNET OF EVERYTHING
trainval/4Rtfi4MSafA/50005 IT'S A VERY HOT PLACE
trainval/4rttG3xyHcw/50001 IN 1947 THE EDINBURGH FESTIVAL WAS BORN AND AVIGNON WAS BORN AND HUNDREDS OF OTHERS WOULD
trainval/4rttG3xyHcw/50002 FESTIVALS PROMOTE DIVERSITY THEY BRING NEIGHBORS INTO DIALOGUE THEY INCREASE
trainval/4rttG3xyHcw/50003 I MEAN I'D THOUGHT ABOUT THE HARBOUR BRIDGE OR BONDI BEACH BUT MINTO
trainval/4sg9TlsMRVA/50001 I DIDN'T HAVE MANY ASPIRATIONS AS A KID BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF SERVICES I HAD TO
trainval/4sg9TlsMRVA/50002 AND ONE OF MY EARLIEST DREAMS WAS TO GET TO COLLEGE
trainval/4sg9TlsMRVA/50003 SO WHEN I GOT TO COLLEGE I BECAME AN ADVOCATE
trainval/4sg9TlsMRVA/50004 IT'S LIKE HOW HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE
trainval/4sg9TlsMRVA/50005 EARLY INTERVENTION IS THE KEY FOR THESE KIDS
trainval/4sg9TlsMRVA/50006 ONE OF THE BEST SUPPORTS THAT CAME TO ME WAS WHEN I WAS ABLE TO GO OUT OF DISTRICT
trainval/4sg9TlsMRVA/50007 WHEN I WAS ABLE TO GO OUT OF DISTRICT I WAS ABLE TO FOR THE FIRST TIME REALLY GET THE SUPPORTS I NEEDED THE
trainval/4sg9TlsMRVA/50008 I WENT TO PUBLIC SCHOOL FROM 1ST TO 4TH GRADE AND THEN FROM 5TH TO HIGH
trainval/4sg9TlsMRVA/50009 AND IT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU HOW WIDE OUR SPECTRUM IS FOR AUTISM IT'S JUST HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE DOING
trainval/4sg9TlsMRVA/50010 AUTISM DOESN'T DEFINE MY LIFE
trainval/4sg9TlsMRVA/50011 I DEFINE AUTISM
trainval/4ShLkgv6LSk/50001 SO HOW DO YOU BUILD THAT
trainval/4SkoG9FWP4w/50001 I WANT TO TRY TO SHOW TO YOU HOW ECONOMISTS AND THEIR IDEAS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE RISE OF THE
trainval/4SkoG9FWP4w/50002 THE REAL KEY IS THEY MAKE YOU THIS PROPOSITION
trainval/4SkoG9FWP4w/50003 BUT THE CEO OF GOOGLE AT THE TIME ERIC SCHMIDT STILL WASN'T SOLD ON THE SECOND PRICE AUCTION AS THE WAY TO
trainval/4SkoG9FWP4w/50004 NOW OUR GUY I'M GOING TO CALL HIM THE ANTI HERO
trainval/4SkoG9FWP4w/50005 IT'S A 300 BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE
trainval/4SkoG9FWP4w/50006 THIS RULE WAS OBVIOUSLY IN PLACE TO PROTECT OTHER TRUCKERS FROM COMPETITION WHICH OF COURSE WAS THE WHOLE
trainval/4SkoG9FWP4w/50008 BUT THEY ALSO OPPOSED IT FOR ANOTHER REASON
trainval/4SkoG9FWP4w/50009 THEY'RE NOT NATURAL MONOPOLIES IN THE SAME WAY THAT A LOCAL UTILITY IS THAT NEEDS REGULATION IN
trainval/4SkoG9FWP4w/50010 NO AIRLINES AND TRUCKS SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN REGULATED
trainval/4SkoG9FWP4w/50011 BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR MY STORY IS THAT DEREGULATION UNLEASHED VIGOROUS COMPETITION
trainval/4SkoG9FWP4w/50012 THEY WENT ON TO DEVELOP A HIGHLY FLEXIBLE AND EFFICIENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM THAT WAS
trainval/4SkoG9FWP4w/50013 SO HE PERSUADES HAL VARIAN TO LEAVE HIS TENURED POSITION AT BERKELEY AND JOIN GOOGLE AS
trainval/4SSn83lCbTg/50001 I DIDN'T WANT MONEY BACK I WANTED BION BACK
trainval/4SSn83lCbTg/50002 I WANTED OUR LIFE BACK
trainval/4SSn83lCbTg/50003 BUT WE DUG IN AND FOUGHT BACK
trainval/4SSn83lCbTg/50004 WELL HONESTLY I DIDN'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION
trainval/4SY6Te9Y1ME/50001 WE NEED TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THAT IMAGE
trainval/4SY6Te9Y1ME/50002 I THINK BY NOW WE CAN ALL AGREE AND CONFIDENTLY ANSWER THAT THE FUTURE ITS
trainval/4SY6Te9Y1ME/50003 SO AT THE SAME TIME I WOULD LIKE TO STRESS THAT SOCIETY NEEDS TO REEVALUATE ITS PERCEPTION OF YOUTH
trainval/4T9N3ZcRBSI/50001 THERE'S NO CAPITAL FOR THE NON PROFIT
trainval/4T9N3ZcRBSI/50002 WE HAD TO FIND FREE AND FOUND MATERIALS EVERY NIGHT SO WE COULD WORK THE NEXT
trainval/4tQee2SJgUo/50001 I EXPERIENCE THIS ALL THE TIME WHERE YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF EXPECTATIONS RELIGIOUS ONES AND CULTURAL
trainval/4tQee2SJgUo/50002 IT IS THROUGH ART THAT WE CAN REALLY TELL OUR OWN STORY
trainval/4uAAegPkCKo/50001 THESE BIOPRODUCTS HAVE A HUGE POTENTIAL TO MAKE THE WORLD MUCH MORE SUSTAINABLE AND IT'S CURRENTLY UNDERGOING
trainval/4uAAegPkCKo/50002 WITHIN THREE MONTHS MY BEST FRIEND FROM GRADUATE SCHOOL AND I STARTED A COMPANY DEVELOPING AND COMMERCIALIZING ALGAE INK
trainval/4uAAegPkCKo/50004 PENICILLIN WAS DEVELOPED BY A SCOTTISH SCIENTIST WHO CAME BACK FROM VACATION TO FIND A TYPE OF
trainval/4v4Pf5Dt8Hg/50001 HOW DO PARENTS USE KIDS' WEAR
trainval/4VC0E1k77yI/50001 WHEN HE PUTS HIS MIND TO IT
trainval/4VC0E1k77yI/50002 REALIZE THAT LIFE IS SHORT AND TOO PRECIOUS TO SQUANDER
trainval/4VC0E1k77yI/50003 BEING ABLE TO SEE THE WORLD IN ALL ITS GLORY BEING ABLE TO HAVE MORE THAN JUST A PRISON STORY
trainval/4VC0E1k77yI/50004 MY LIFE WILL NOT BE DEFINED BY THE BAD CHOICES THAT I'VE MADE OR COULD MAKE
trainval/4VC0E1k77yI/50005 IT WILL BE DEFINED BY MY WILLINGNESS TO GIVE BACK MORE THAN I TAKE
trainval/4wOxJOPnSUg/50001 WE CAN TELL THE DISTANCE WE CAN TELL THAT WHEN THEY COLLIDED THEY MERGED TO FORM A NEW BLACK HOLE ABOUT
trainval/4XESlSz0TLM/50001 NOW BUT WHICH SHOULD YOU INVEST IN
trainval/4XESlSz0TLM/50002 NOT THAT WE NEED MANY PILOTS REALLY
trainval/4XESlSz0TLM/50003 NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT BUT I GUESS WE HAVE PRODUCED FAR TOO MANY OF THESE IN THE LAST 20 YEARS ANYWAY
trainval/4XESlSz0TLM/50004 AND STILL YOUNG PEOPLE'S CHOICES NOW REFLECT THAT OLD INFORMATION
trainval/4XESlSz0TLM/50005 AND YOU COULD
trainval/4XESlSz0TLM/50007 SO IS THAT A PROBLEM
trainval/4XESlSz0TLM/50008 WE COME BACK TO THE FACT THAT THE ONLY POINT OF REFERENCE IS REALLY YOURSELF
trainval/4xnVNvd8lBg/50001 THEN WE BUMP IT UP
trainval/4xnVNvd8lBg/50002 WHEN YOU PICK IT OUT OF YOUR DRAWER IN THE MORNING WHAT SHOULD I WEAR
trainval/4YooZCkyUsY/50001 AND WE TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND PUT IT BACK INTO THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE
trainval/4YooZCkyUsY/50002 AND WHO WINS BY THIS
trainval/4YooZCkyUsY/50003 AND ALL OF THESE DRUGS WERE MOVED FORWARD BASED ON POSITIVE RESULTS IN MOUSE MODELS
trainval/4YS3gGpnPe8/50001 SO IN A WAY BY STUDYING A WOMAN YOU CAN READ THE STRUCTURE AND THE IDEOLOGY OF THE COUNTRY
trainval/4YS3gGpnPe8/50002 I AM A NOMADIC ARTIST
trainval/4YS3gGpnPe8/50003 I WORK IN MOROCCO IN TURKEY IN MEXICO
trainval/4YS3gGpnPe8/50004 THEY HAVE CONFRONTED THE AUTHORITY
trainval/4yyPSZSGLOI/50001 AND WHAT I WANT TO DO FOR THESE 15 MINUTES WE'LL SHARE 5 THINGS WE'LL SHARE 5
trainval/4yyPSZSGLOI/50002 ONE THING THAT'S MUCH MORE TRUE TODAY THAN WAS TRUE 1298
trainval/4yyPSZSGLOI/50003 AND THEN LIKE MANY PEOPLE I WAS INSPIRED TO BEGIN A LIFE OF PUBLIC SERVICE
trainval/4yyPSZSGLOI/50004 IF YOU THINK ABOUT THINGS IN THE UNITED STATES LIKE THE ANTI SOPA MOVEMENT IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE REVOLUTIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST
trainval/4yyPSZSGLOI/50005 THERE IS A POWER GAP
trainval/4yyPSZSGLOI/50006 THERE IS AN INSTITUTIONAL GAP
trainval/4yyPSZSGLOI/50007 WHERE IS NELSON MANDELA
trainval/4yyPSZSGLOI/50008 WHERE IS THE INSTITUTIONAL BASIS UPON WHICH WE CAN NOW GOVERN
trainval/4yyPSZSGLOI/50009 WE THE PEOPLE IN THE WHITE SHIRTS THE RED TIES AND THE PIN STRIPE SUITS IT'S TIME FOR US TO TAKE OVER
trainval/4yyPSZSGLOI/50010 AND I THINK THAT OTHER COUNTRIES ARE OUGHT TO DO THE EXACT THING
trainval/4yyPSZSGLOI/50011 40 OF AMERICA'S GDP IS EQUAL TO 6 TRILLION DOLLARS OF ANNUAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY
trainval/4yyPSZSGLOI/50012 I HOPE ONE DAY TO BE AN OLD MAN
trainval/4yyPSZSGLOI/50013 I'VE BEEN IN SO MANY COUNTRIES WHERE WOMEN DO 2 3 OF THE WORK FOR 1 3 OF THE
trainval/4yyPSZSGLOI/50014 AND YOU KNOW THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT THERE IT WAS TOUGH
trainval/4yyPSZSGLOI/50015 YOU KNOW I STARTED THIS COMPANY BECAUSE I BELIEVED THAT WOMEN COULD REALLY THROW THEIR SHOULDERS AND BE
trainval/4yyPSZSGLOI/50016 EMPOWERING WOMEN ECONOMICALLY AND IN THE SECURITY DOMAIN IS NOT A MORAL ISSUE
trainval/4yyPSZSGLOI/50017 I NOW HAVE 70 WOMEN WHO WORK FOR ME
trainval/4yyPSZSGLOI/50018 I'VE GOT CLIENTS IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE EAST ASIA IN THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
trainval/4yyPSZSGLOI/50019 SO THIS YOUNG WOMAN MARIA UMAR STARTED THE WOMEN'S DIGITAL LEAGUE
trainval/4yyPSZSGLOI/50020 SHE NOW EMPLOYS 70 OTHER WOMEN
trainval/4yyPSZSGLOI/50021 THINK ABOUT THE GOOD FRIDAY ACCORDS IN NORTHERN IRELAND IN 1998
trainval/4yyPSZSGLOI/50022 HE SAID SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY SORT OF LIT THE PATH FOR ME
trainval/4Z75ASJMBx4/50001 SHARPEN YOUR QUILL
trainval/4Z75ASJMBx4/50002 HOW NATURE WORKS IS SUNBEAMS COME DOWN IT'S CAPTURED BY PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND CONVERTED
trainval/4Z75ASJMBx4/50003 HOW DO WE DUPLICATE THAT IF WE HAVE A SYSTEM OF PRIVATE LAND OWNERSHIP AND ALL THAT
trainval/4Z75ASJMBx4/50004 AND PARTICIPATING IN THE NURTURING OF THE PLANET
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50001 IT'S INCREDIBLY SUBJECTIVE RIGHT
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50002 SO OBVIOUSLY HOMO SAPIENS AT THE TOP
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50003 IT AFFECTS EVERYTHING FROM SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS THE HOLIDAYS WE CELEBRATE TO THE NAMES THAT WE GIVE OUR CHILDREN
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50004 AND ALSO WHAT WE FIND WITH THESE EARLY TOOLMAKERS IS THAT THEY ACTUALLY WERE EXHIBITING
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50006 LET'S TALK ABOUT MENTAL TIME TRAVEL
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50007 NOW WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY MENTAL TIME TRAVEL IS THE ABILITY TO THINK ABOUT PAST AND FUTURE
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50008 THESE ARE ACTUALLY VERY UNUSUAL THINGS
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50009 SO PRE PLANNING BUT EVEN AT A GREATER DEGREE
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50010 SO YOU PROBABLY SAW I SAID THE GOD SPOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THERE IS THAT
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50011 SIMILAR TO ENHANCED WORKING MEMORY THERE'S ACTUALLY SEVERAL PARTS OF THE BRAIN THAT ARE ALL KIND OF WORKING TOGETHER
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50012 BUT THE QUESTION THAT'S COME UP IS
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50013 NOT JUST ABOUT SIZE BUT THEN ALSO ABOUT HOW IS IT WIRED HOW ARE THE NEURAL PATHWAYS MOVING
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50014 BECAUSE THAT IS THE REALITY IS IF WE GO FAR ENOUGH BACK INTO OUR OWN DEEP HISTORY THERE
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50015 SO NOT SOMETHING THAT'S USEFUL AT A VERY 1
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50017 SO WHAT'S GOING ON
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50018 AND THIS IS KIND OF THE STORY GOING FORWARD AND THIS IS AGAIN WHERE WYNN AND COOLIDGE HAVE MADE THIS
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50019 MAYBE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AS EARLY AS 60000 SO SOMEWHERE IN THAT 40 60000 RANGE IS WHEN MODERN HUMANS
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50020 HUGE HERDS OF BISON AND MAMMOTH AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS ON THE LANDSCAPE
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50021 SO LOTS OF THINGS TO EAT WHICH WAS KIND OF A PULL FACTOR THAT PROBABLY KEPT MODERN HUMANS THERE
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50022 THEY SHOW UP IN EUROPE SOMEWHERE AROUND 40000 EVEN 45000 IN SOME SPOTS AND THEY SPREAD OUT AROUND THERE
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50023 AND WHAT'S SO FASCINATING ABOUT THE EARLY HUMANS IN AFRICA IS THAT FOR PROBABLY ABOUT THE FIRST
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50026 SOMETHING THAT'S SAY HALF ANIMAL HALF HUMAN WOULD BE AN IMPOSSIBLE ENTITY
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50027 THEY'RE MAKING REALLY NICE TOOLS SURVIVING QUITE WELL MAKING GOOD USE OF THEIR LANDSCAPE ALL OF THOSE TYPES OF THINGS ARE IN
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50028 THIS PARTICULAR ONE IS THE ADULT MALE AND IT'S ABOUT 28000 YEARS OLD IT'S FROM RUSSIA
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50029 THEN ON TOP OF THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE FACT THAT THE TWO OTHER BURIALS AT THAT PARTICULAR SITE ARE ACTUALLY OF TWO
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50030 BUT WHAT WE'RE NOT SEEING IS THOSE KINDS OF BEHAVIOURS THAT MAKE US GO
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50031 SO SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY GOING ON IN THAT SENSE
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50032 HEAD OF A LION BODY OF A HUMAN
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50033 AGAIN COMING BACK TO THAT THAT DOESN'T EXIST ANYWHERE IN NATURE
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50034 WHY ARE THEY DEPICTING THIS
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50035 THIS IS NOT A SELF REPRESENTATION
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50036 THAT PARTICULAR ONE IS ABOUT 32000 YEARS OLD
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50037 SO AGAIN THAT SUGGESTS SOME SORT OF HARNESSING OF SOME UNSEEN WORLD THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50038 WHAT IF THEY WERE WEARING A MASK
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50040 THAT ONCE YOU GO INTO A CAVE WE GO IN WITH HEADLAMPS AND LOTS OF LIGHT AND WE KNOW WHAT A CAVE IS GEOLOGICALLY
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50041 SO NOW WE GET SPECIFICALLY TO A RESEARCH PROJECT THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON WHERE I SAID OKAY WELL LET'S TRY
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50042 IS IT POSSIBLE
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50043 ARE WE SEEING ON THE WALLS POTENTIALLY SOME OF THE TRANCE LIKE IMAGERY WHICH THEY HAVE
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50044 AND SO THIS IS WHERE WHAT I'VE LOOKED AT IS CAN WE FIND THOSE IN THE CAVES IN EUROPE
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50045 SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50046 BASICALLY WHAT IT SUGGESTS TO ME I CAN'T GIVE YOU A DEFINITIVE ANSWER AND SAY YES ABSOLUTELY THERE
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50047 SO IF WE'RE CAPABLE OF IT WHY WOULDN'T THEY HAVE BEEN
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50048 THEY LIVE OUT IN THE DESERT AND STILL PRACTICE THE HUNTER GATHERER LIFESTYLE
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50049 AND GUESS WHAT
trainval/4ZgwzSm7sRs/50050 THEY STILL DO ROCK ART
trainval/501FEzbB1JI/50001 SO NOW YOU HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO ABANDON YOUR CAR WHERE IT IS ON THE HIGHWAY
trainval/501FEzbB1JI/50002 ONE OF THE MOST COMMON PLACES WE SEND SATELLITES IS THE LOW EARTH ORBIT POSSIBLY TO IMAGE THE SURFACE OF EARTH
trainval/501FEzbB1JI/50003 SATELLITES THERE REMAIN IN THE SAME PLACE ABOVE EARTH AS THE EARTH ROTATES WHICH ENABLES THINGS LIKE
trainval/501FEzbB1JI/50004 SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THOSE LOW EARTH ORBITING SPACECRAFT TO BE MADE TO DEORBIT IN
trainval/501FEzbB1JI/50005 THESE GUIDELINES ARE ALSO NOT LONG TERM THEY'RE NOT PROACTIVE NOR DO THEY ADDRESS THE DEBRIS THAT'S
trainval/501FEzbB1JI/50006 THEY'RE ONLY IN PLACE TO LIMIT THE FUTURE CREATION OF DEBRIS
trainval/501FEzbB1JI/50007 NOW MOUNT EVEREST IS ACTUALLY AN INTERESTING COMPARISON OF A NEW APPROACH TO HOW WE INTERACT WITH OUR ENVIRONMENTS
trainval/501FEzbB1JI/50008 BUT WE SIMPLY CANNOT REACH NEW HEIGHTS AND CREATE AN EVEN HIGHER GARBAGE DUMP
trainval/501FEzbB1JI/50009 AND WHILE WE OFTEN TAKE FOR GRANTED THE SERVICES THAT SATELLITES PROVIDE US THE SATELLITES THEMSELVES
trainval/501FEzbB1JI/50010 OR MAYBE A SATELLITE NEEDS TO HAVE TECHNOLOGY ON BOARD TO HELP ACCELERATE DEORBIT
trainval/501FEzbB1JI/50012 PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD RELY ON SATELLITE INFRASTRUCTURE EVERY DAY FOR INFORMATION ENTERTAINMENT
trainval/501FEzbB1JI/50013 SATELLITES EVEN PLAY A ROLE IN THE OPERATION OF OUR FINANCIAL AND ENERGY MARKETS
trainval/501FEzbB1JI/50014 WAS DESIGNED FOR END OF LIFE DISPOSAL VIA A SMALL DRAG SAIL
trainval/501FEzbB1JI/50015 SO MAYBE YOU GET INTO THINGS LIKE HIGH POWERED LASERS OR TUGGING USING NETS OR TETHERS AS CRAZY AS THOSE
trainval/501FEzbB1JI/50016 AND THEN ONE REALLY COOL POSSIBILITY IS THE IDEA OF ORBITAL TOW TRUCKS OR SPACE MECHANICS
trainval/501FEzbB1JI/50017 OR WHAT IF THAT VERY SAME ROBOTIC ARM COULD REFUEL THE PROPELLANT TANK ON A SPACECRAFT THAT RELIES ON CHEMICAL
trainval/501FEzbB1JI/50018 THERE'S ALSO COMPLEX SPACE LAWS AND POLITICS THAT WE HAVE TO SORT OUT
trainval/50m48lpi4AU/50001 AND THE REAL QUESTION IS
trainval/50m48lpi4AU/50002 WE HAVE ALL OUR COMMUNICATION DEVICES RIGHT
trainval/50m48lpi4AU/50003 I THINK THIS IS A REALLY GOOD THING
trainval/50m48lpi4AU/50004 I WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD
trainval/50m48lpi4AU/50005 I KNOW I AM
trainval/50m48lpi4AU/50006 I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED IT THINK ABOUT
trainval/50m48lpi4AU/50007 YOU WANT TO MOVE UP IN BUSINESS
trainval/50m48lpi4AU/50008 AND TO BE HONEST I MEAN THIS IS A BUSINESS ICON A FORTUNE TEN CEO
trainval/50m48lpi4AU/50009 SO WE GET ON THE JET I BOARD THE JET WE HAVE A NICE DINNER
trainval/50m48lpi4AU/50010 AND THAT LED TO A BUNCH OF OTHER THOUGHTS
trainval/50m48lpi4AU/50011 FOR TWENTY YEARS AND I'D DONE OKAY BUT I WAS WAITING ALWAYS FOR SOMEBODY ELSE TO TELL ME IS IT TIME FOR THAT NEXT I DIDN'T WANT TO
trainval/50m48lpi4AU/50012 AND I OFFER THIS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION
trainval/50m48lpi4AU/50013 LET'S BREAK IT DOWN
trainval/50m48lpi4AU/50014 TO LOVE WHAT THEY'RE DOING
trainval/50m48lpi4AU/50015 YOU SEE ALL THESE CHIEF TITLES THIS IS A REPRESENTATION OF THAT
trainval/50m48lpi4AU/50016 THAT'S A GREAT PLACE TO BE
trainval/50m48lpi4AU/50017 THAT'S A GREAT PLACE TO BE
trainval/50m48lpi4AU/50018 I REMEMBER MELISSA'S PATIENCE WAITING HER TURN
trainval/50m48lpi4AU/50019 SHE WAS AN INSPIRATION
trainval/50m48lpi4AU/50020 I'LL TELL YOU WHAT SHE SERVED ME
trainval/50m48lpi4AU/50021 I FOCUS ON NUMBERS
trainval/50m48lpi4AU/50022 INCREASINGLY FOR THE RIGHT REASONS I FOCUS WITH ORGANIZATIONS ON
trainval/50m48lpi4AU/50023 THE TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE
trainval/50m48lpi4AU/50024 BUT IT'S ABOUT NUMBERS
trainval/50m48lpi4AU/50025 I NORMALLY FOCUS ON NUMBERS
trainval/53P0aypkpXY/50001 IN ORDER TO HELP YOU FLIP THE SCRIPT ABOUT UNDOCUMENTED
trainval/53P0aypkpXY/50002 I MAY NOW HAVE ACCESS TO INSTITUTIONS OF AMAZING HIGHER LEARNING AND
trainval/53P0aypkpXY/50003 WHAT WOULD I TELL THEM
trainval/53P0aypkpXY/50004 I FOUND TWO PURPLE LESIONS ON MY EITHER HANDS AND FOOT
trainval/53P0aypkpXY/50005 AT THIS POINT I KNEW I HAD KAPOSI SARCOMA AND PNEUMONIA
trainval/53P0aypkpXY/50006 ALL OF THESE CAN BE HALTED VERY EASILY AT THIS POINT BY TREATMENT
trainval/53P0aypkpXY/50007 I WAS GOING TO CHANGE MY LEGAL NAME FROM DEBANUJ DASGUPTA TO
trainval/53P0aypkpXY/50008 I COULD FEEL RODRIGO'S TOUCH WARM HANDS ON MY COLD BODY
trainval/53P0aypkpXY/50009 ICE FOUND ME AND DECLARED ME AS ILLEGAL
trainval/53P0aypkpXY/50010 AT THIS POINT I AM BEING TAKEN INTO DETENTION
trainval/53P0aypkpXY/50011 I AM SHACKLED MY LEGS AND ARMS AND TAKEN INTO A SINGLE CELL WHERE
trainval/53P0aypkpXY/50012 ON THE FIFTH NIGHT I COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE
trainval/53P0aypkpXY/50013 THIS DARK CELL
trainval/53P0aypkpXY/50014 AND PROBABLY HE THOUGHT THAT I HAVE TWO MASTER'S DEGREES
trainval/53P0aypkpXY/50015 I FOUGHT MY IMMIGRATION CASE
trainval/53P0aypkpXY/50016 I DIDN'T GIVE UP
trainval/53P0aypkpXY/50017 I STAND IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY AS A LEGAL PERMANENT RESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
trainval/53P0aypkpXY/50018 THINK ABOUT ME DYING ALONE IN THAT HOSPITAL BED WITH MY FRIEND TRYING TO SAVE ME
trainval/53P0aypkpXY/50019 THINK ABOUT ME ALONE SHACKLED IN A DETENTION CELL
trainval/55n9pHSA0O8/50001 WHAT IF CONFLICT ISN'T A PROBLEM
trainval/55n9pHSA0O8/50002 AFTER 15 YEARS OF STUDYING RESEARCHING TEACHING AND TRAINING IN CONFLICT I'VE LEARNED
trainval/55n9pHSA0O8/50003 IT TAKES THREE KEYS IN ORDER TO DO THAT
trainval/55n9pHSA0O8/50004 NOW I AM NO STRANGER TO BEING STUCK IN CONFLICT
trainval/55n9pHSA0O8/50005 I STARTED LEARNING ABOUT CONFLICT BECAUSE I WAS TERRIBLE AT IT
trainval/55n9pHSA0O8/50006 SHE SAID I DON'T WANT TO PUT THEM IN THE TRAY
trainval/55n9pHSA0O8/50008 IT'S HARD WORK THOUGH
trainval/55n9pHSA0O8/50009 IT CAN BE AS HARD AS TRYING TO LEARN A NEW LANGUAGE
trainval/55n9pHSA0O8/50010 I'VE CREATED THE ACRONYM VOCAB TO HELP YOU IN THOSE MOMENTS TO THINK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN
trainval/55n9pHSA0O8/50011 HOW YOU CAN CREATE THE CHANGE THAT YOU WANT
trainval/55n9pHSA0O8/50012 AFTER I ASK I CAN LISTEN
trainval/55n9pHSA0O8/50013 I CAN'T EVEN GET MY FOUR YEAR OLD DAUGHTER TO PICK UP THREE HAIR PRETTIES
trainval/55n9pHSA0O8/50014 I ALSO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT BECAUSE CONFLICT IS ABOUT CHANGE THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME LOSS INVOLVED
trainval/55n9pHSA0O8/50015 SO I TRIED TO PUT A STOP TO IT
trainval/55n9pHSA0O8/50016 I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE
trainval/55n9pHSA0O8/50017 BUT I'VE BEEN WORRIED AND SAD
trainval/55n9pHSA0O8/50018 I HAVE TO OWN THAT
trainval/55n9pHSA0O8/50019 I DON'T WANT THAT
trainval/55n9pHSA0O8/50020 CAN YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND
trainval/55n9pHSA0O8/50021 I TRIED TO BREATHE IN AND LET GO OF MY DESIRE TO HAVE HER RESPOND
trainval/55n9pHSA0O8/50022 I ASKED HER HOW SHE WAS FEELING
trainval/55n9pHSA0O8/50023 I TOLD HER ABOUT HOW I WAS BULLIED WHEN I WAS A KID
trainval/55n9pHSA0O8/50024 WE DISCUSSED HOW SHE COULD SET BOUNDARIES WITH KIDS AT SCHOOL
trainval/55n9pHSA0O8/50025 I NO LONGER SEE CONFLICT AS NEGATIVE
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50001 NOW I OFFER THAT HYPOTHETICAL BECAUSE IT'S EMBLEMATIC OF THE WAY THAT WE AS MILITARY OFFICERS OFTEN THINK ABOUT
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50002 NOW IN TERMS OF MY COMBAT HYPOTHETICAL THINKING ABOUT A TRANSLATOR IN THIS VERY INSTRUMENTAL WAY IS ABSOLUTELY FINE IT'S A
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50003 YOU'RE LOOKING FOR YES OR NO
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50006 NOW SIGNIFIERS BECAUSE WORDS REPRESENT ALWAYS IMPERFECTLY SOME CONCEPT
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50007 THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE RIGOR OF OUR ENGLISH DEPARTMENT UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DISRUPT THAT SEQUENCE YOU GET
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50008 HE THEN GOES TO DISCUSS SIGNIFIERS AND THE RELATIVITY OF THEM
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50009 CULTURES THROUGH THEIR SHARED VALUES BELIEFS AND EXPERIENCES WILL START TO IDENTIFY THE SAME THEY WILL BECOME
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50010 YOU GUYS ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE THIS ALL THE TIME HERE AT WEST POINT
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50011 BUT WHEN YOU CALL YOUR FRIEND FROM YOUR HOMETOWN OR AT ANOTHER COLLEGE AND SAY I CAN'T TAKE PASS THIS WEEKEND I HAVE
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50012 NOW THIS IS KIND OF A FUNNY EXAMPLE OF THE RELATIVITY OF LANGUAGE BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN START TO INTUIT HOW IN MORE SEVERE
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50013 THE EASY EXAMPLE TO ALWAYS BRING UP IS THE WORD DEMOCRACY
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50014 IF YOU SAY DEMOCRACY HERE AT WEST POINT AND YOU SAY IT IN MOST PLACES IN THE US IT'S NOT LIKE WE THINK ABOUT DEMOCRACY AS THE
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50015 BUT I WOULD POSIT IF YOU SAY THE WORD DEMOCRACY' IN IRAQ OR AFGHANISTAN OR SYRIA OR LIBYA OR IN THE UKRAINE
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50016 THAT'S THE LAST TIME SOMEBODY BROUGHT ME DEMOCRACY
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50018 AND SO THE CONNOTATION IS DIFFERENT
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50019 THE NOVEL IS FIVES AND TWENTY FIVES BY AUTHOR MICHAEL PITRE AND IT FOLLOWS A MARINE PLATOON THROUGH IRAQ THE
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50020 NOW DO YOU HAVE ANY WEAPONS HERE
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50021 YOU TAKFIRI KNOW ABOUT ABU GHRAIB
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50022 THIS WILL BE WORSE
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50023 TELL PEDERSON WHERE YOU KEEP THE ROCKETS OR WE WILL PUT YOU ALL IN A NAKED PYRAMID RIGHT OVER THERE TAKE PICTURES FOR THE INTERNET ALL OVER
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50024 IT STANDS IN FOR A ROUTINE SERIES OF QUESTIONS WHEN A PATROL INVESTIGATES A NEW SIGHT
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50025 BUT UNBEKNOWNST TO HIM HIS INTERPRETER EITHER DOES NOT BEST CASE OR WORST CASE OF COURSE IS LYING TO
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50026 THE UNIT BELOW THEM DETERMINES TO THAT END THAT THEY NEED TO REDUCE THE VIOLENCE TO AN EXTENT THAT THE CITIZENS CAN
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50027 HE KNOWS THERE'S A LOT OF RISK FOR THE PEOPLE HE'S TALKING TO AND DOING THAT HE KNOWS THAT THEY KNOW THAT THEY COULD FACE
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50028 SO INSTEAD OF TRY TO ENGAGE A CONCEPT HE KNOWS OR ASSUMES HIS AUDIENCE WILL NOT UNDERSTAND HE HAS RESORTED TO SOMETHING MORE
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50029 AND HE CAN BE FAIRLY SURE THAT HIS AUDIENCE KNOWS ABOUT ABU GHRAIB AND WHAT HAPPENED THERE
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50030 PEDERSON WAS TRYING TO COMMUNICATE SOMETHING PROFOUND BEHIND ALL THAT
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50031 IT'S ABOUT TRUST AND COOPERATION IN A VERY COMPLEX ENVIRONMENT
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50032 THE LAST THING I WOULD TELL YOU IS CHALLENGE THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE INHERENT THAT MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IN A WHILE IN
trainval/56WGgJNBRxQ/50034 I'D LEAVE YOU WITH A HYPOTHETICAL THOUGH
trainval/57FMau29OSg/50001 THAT IS CODE FOR UNEDUCATABLE
trainval/57FMau29OSg/50002 JUST LIKE THAT
trainval/58eTdyeVwbA/50001 THE QUESTION THAT DRIVES MY WORK IS WHETHER OR NOT IT MIGHT BE TRUE THAT WHAT
trainval/58eTdyeVwbA/50002 AS IT RELATES TO RACE IN PARTICULAR FAMILIES CAN CERTAINLY PROTECT FAMILY MEMBERS AGAINST
trainval/58eTdyeVwbA/50003 SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
trainval/58eTdyeVwbA/50004 SURE ENOUGH I FOUND A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES THAT RESONATED WITH WHAT ANA HAD SAID TO ME
trainval/58eTdyeVwbA/50005 SO FIRST I MET A WOMAN BY THE NAME OF DO A ELENA
trainval/58eTdyeVwbA/50006 THEIR ASSUMPTION WAS THAT THIS CHILD WOULD EVENTUALLY GROW UP TO BE DARK SKINNED
trainval/58eTdyeVwbA/50007 I'M AFRAID THEY WILL LOVE HER MORE
trainval/58eTdyeVwbA/50008 WHAT THIS SUGGESTED TO ME IS THAT HONEST PORTRAYAL OF FAMILIES WAS A PARTIAL ONE
trainval/58eTdyeVwbA/50009 OTHER FAMILIES DEVELOPED ALTERNATIVE ANTI RACIST PERSONAS
trainval/58eTdyeVwbA/50010 BUT NOT JUST THAT IT MUST ALSO PROMOTE CONCRETE PUBLIC POLICIES CONCRETE
trainval/59K6SwHLtcw/50001 AND IF YOU TELL ME THAT IGNORANCE AND THE LACK OF EDUCATION IS NOT A PROBLEM
trainval/59K6SwHLtcw/50002 IGNORANCE IS THE FIRST ENEMY OF THE U
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50001 SOME OF WHAT I'VE WORKED ON IS PEOPLE WHO HAVE DWARFISM SO PEOPLE WHO ARE MUCH SHORTER THAN TYPICAL
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50002 AND A LOT OF WHAT I'VE WORKED ON IS PEOPLE WHO HAVE ATYPICAL SEX SO PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THE STANDARD MALE
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50003 INTERSEX COMES IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT FORMS
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50004 NOW I DON'T WANT YOU TO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME IMAGINING THE CONCEPTION BECAUSE IF YOU DO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LISTEN TO ME
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50005 THEY'RE IN THE BACK OF OUR BODY
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50006 AND THE ADRENAL GLANDS MAKE ANDROGENS WHICH ARE A MASCULINIZING HORMONE
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50007 AND AS A CONSEQUENCE HIS GENITALS WERE MASCULINIZED HIS BRAIN WAS SUBJECT TO THE MORE TYPICAL MASCULINE COMPONENT OF HORMONES
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50008 AND HE WAS BORN LOOKING LIKE A BOY NOBODY SUSPECTED ANYTHING
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50009 SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE XX CHROMOSOMES DEVELOP WHAT ARE CALLED OVOTESTIS WHICH IS WHEN YOU HAVE OVARIAN TISSUE WITH TESTICULAR
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50010 AND WE'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE WHY THAT HAPPENS
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50011 AND IN THE OTHER CASE THE SPERM IS CARRYING AN X CHROMOSOME MEETING THE X CHROMOSOME OF THE EGG
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50012 I HAD A LOT OF JOURNALISTS CALLING ME ASKING ME WHICH IS THE TEST THEY'RE GOING TO RUN THAT WILL TELL US WHETHER OR NOT
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50013 BOTH ARE VIABLE BOTH TAKE OFF
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50014 AND IT'S NOT JUST IN TERMS OF SEX
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50015 AS WE LOOK WE GET INTO ALL SORTS OF UNCOMFORTABLE AREAS
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50016 WE LOOK FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE SHARE AT LEAST 95 PERCENT OF OUR DNA WITH CHIMPANZEES
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50017 ONE OF THE PLACES WE'RE SEEING IT FOR EXAMPLE IN OUR CULTURE IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY IS BATTLES OVER THE BEGINNING OF LIFE
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50018 IN THE PAST OUR ANCESTORS NEVER HAD TO STRUGGLE SO MUCH WITH THIS QUESTION OF WHEN SOMEBODY WAS DEAD
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50020 WHERE WE WANT TO TAKE VITAL ORGANS OUT OF BEINGS AND GIVE THEM TO OTHER BEINGS
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50021 THEY WERE MOVING TOWARDS A NATURALISTIC CONCEPT
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50022 AND IF YOU LOOK FOR EXAMPLE IN THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE THEY TALK ABOUT NATURE AND NATURE'S GOD
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50023 THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT GOD AND GOD'S NATURE
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50024 WHAT HAPPENED WAS WOMEN FOR EXAMPLE WHO WANTED THE RIGHT TO VOTE TOOK THE FOUNDING FATHERS' CONCEPT OF
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50025 FOR EXAMPLE I DON'T WANT TO GIVE A FISH THE SAME RIGHTS AS A HUMAN
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50026 I DON'T WANT TO SAY WE GIVE UP ENTIRELY ON ANATOMY
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50027 I DON'T WANT TO SAY A FIVE YEAR OLD SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONSENT TO SEX OR CONSENT TO MARRY
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50028 LET'S IMAGINE ONE OF THEM MARY IS BORN THREE MONTHS PREMATURELY SO SHE'S BORN ON JUNE 1
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50029 HE SAYS WE SHOULD JUDGE PEOPLE BASED NOT ON THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN BUT ON THE CONTENT OF THEIR CHARACTER MOVING
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50030 I ALSO WANT TO SAY THERE ARE PROBABLY ALSO SOME YELLOW LABRADORS THAT I KNOW THAT ARE MORE CAPABLE OF INFORMED INTELLIGENT
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50031 IT TURNS OUT TO BE REALLY DIFFICULT
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50032 I MEAN THEY WERE SO BRAVE AND SO BOLD AND SO RADICAL IN WHAT THEY DID THAT
trainval/59SRn1SkWAA/50033 FEMINISM IS ALL ABOUT UNDOING STEREOTYPES ABOUT GENDER SO THERE'S NOTHING FEMININE ABOUT FEMINISM
trainval/5AcjM5BKfRQ/50001 IT'S THAT QUESTION WHY AND WHAT'S GONE WRONG
trainval/5AcjM5BKfRQ/50002 I STILL DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT IS
trainval/5AcjM5BKfRQ/50003 THAT'S WHEN WE DISCOVERED AQUAPONICS
trainval/5aH2Ppjpcho/50001 ALSO IF YOU LOOK AT PRISON MOVIES SOMETIMES THE WAY THAT THE GUARDS TORTURE THE PRISONERS
trainval/5aH2Ppjpcho/50002 SO THERE WAS NOT A REAL OPPORTUNITY FOR BIG MEANING
trainval/5aH2Ppjpcho/50003 IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO LOVE LEGOS AND SOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T
trainval/5aH2Ppjpcho/50004 AND YOU WOULD SPECULATE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE LEGOS WOULD BUILD MORE LEGOS EVEN FOR LESS MONEY BECAUSE AFTER ALL THEY GET MORE
trainval/5aH2Ppjpcho/50005 SOON AFTER I FINISHED RUNNING THIS EXPERIMENT I WENT TO TALK TO A BIG SOFTWARE COMPANY IN
trainval/5aH2Ppjpcho/50006 AND THEY CAME UP WITH ALL KINDS OF IDEAS
trainval/5aH2Ppjpcho/50007 BUT IT TURNS OUT THEY WERE VERY UNPOPULAR
trainval/5aH2Ppjpcho/50008 I SAID HOW MANY OF YOU NOW GO HOME EARLIER THAN YOU USED TO
trainval/5aH2Ppjpcho/50009 I THINK THE ANSWER IS NO
trainval/5aLiFw8CSEA/50001 SO A LOT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST 40 YEARS AND WHAT I LEARNED WHEN I CAME TO THE GALAPAGOS IS THE IMPORTANCE OF
trainval/5aLiFw8CSEA/50002 MAGELLANIC PENGUINS THE ONES THAT I WORK ON THEY CAN DIVE TO ABOUT 90 METERS AND THEY CAN STAY
trainval/5aLiFw8CSEA/50003 YOU HAVE TO TRAIN TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT
trainval/5aLiFw8CSEA/50004 SO PENGUINS ARE AMAZING ATHLETES
trainval/5aLiFw8CSEA/50005 THEY'RE COMICAL THEY WALK UPRIGHT AND OF COURSE THEY'RE DILIGENT
trainval/5aLiFw8CSEA/50006 AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THEY'RE WELL DRESSED
trainval/5aLiFw8CSEA/50007 AND THIS IS TRUE OF MOST OF OUR LIVING SYSTEMS
trainval/5aLiFw8CSEA/50008 MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HEARD IT
trainval/5aLiFw8CSEA/50009 THINGS DIE WHEN THERE'S NO FOOD
trainval/5aLiFw8CSEA/50010 THEY'RE NOT BREEDING THEY'RE NOT EVEN AROUND
trainval/5aLiFw8CSEA/50011 SO WHEN I WENT TO STUDY THE MAGELLANIC PENGUINS I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS
trainval/5aLiFw8CSEA/50012 THERE WERE PLENTY OF THEM
trainval/5aLiFw8CSEA/50013 BUT WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS NOW FOR MORE THAN A DECADE TO LEARN WHERE THEY GO
trainval/5aLiFw8CSEA/50014 WHY DO THEY DO THAT
trainval/5aLiFw8CSEA/50015 AND SOME OF YOU CONSIDER THEM ALMOST PART OF YOUR FAMILY
trainval/5aLiFw8CSEA/50016 IF YOU HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH A PENGUIN YOU'D SEE IT IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY
trainval/5aLiFw8CSEA/50017 WE USUALLY DON'T AND WE WANT TO START GETTING THE ACCOUNTING SYSTEM RIGHT SO WE CAN PAY THE REAL COST
trainval/5AN5fPFtV0U/50001 YOU REALLY KNOW WHO ICE T IS
trainval/5AN5fPFtV0U/50003 50 CENT SAID IN ONE OF HIS RECORDS
trainval/5AN5fPFtV0U/50004 YOU WANT TO KEEP PEOPLE OFF YOUR BACK
trainval/5AN5fPFtV0U/50005 PEOPLE LOOK AT ME TODAY THEY SAY
trainval/5AN5fPFtV0U/50006 WHY IS YOUR FACE LIKE THAT
trainval/5AN5fPFtV0U/50007 YOU SEEM ANGRY
trainval/5AN5fPFtV0U/50008 HELL YEAH I HAVE THE DAY OFF I'LL COME
trainval/5AN5fPFtV0U/50009 I LEARNED THAT IN SCHOOL THEN I DROPPED OUT HIT THE STREETS CHECKED A GRIP AND NOW I'VE GOT CLOUT
trainval/5AN5fPFtV0U/50010 I HAD NOTHING AND I WANTED IT
trainval/5AN5fPFtV0U/50011 MAYBE THAT'S THE PLAN AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND
trainval/5AN5fPFtV0U/50012 GODDAMN YOU GOT ME SINKING IN QUICKSAND
trainval/5AN5fPFtV0U/50013 IT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE HOPE
trainval/5AN5fPFtV0U/50014 I KNOW BUT I THINK SOMEBODY IS COMING FOR ME
trainval/5AN5fPFtV0U/50015 WHAT CAN I DO
trainval/5AN5fPFtV0U/50016 GOD WILL DEAL WITH THAT
trainval/5AN5fPFtV0U/50017 YOU GOT PEOPLE SAYING
trainval/5AN5fPFtV0U/50018 I MEAN WE DON'T USE LAWYERS I DON'T USE THE POLICE I'M FROM ANOTHER ERA WHERE IF WE GOT A PROBLEM WE'D GO
trainval/5AN5fPFtV0U/50019 THEY BELIEVE IN CRIME AND PUNISHMENT
trainval/5AN5fPFtV0U/50020 MY BOYS WHO ARE IN PELICAN'S BAY CMC MY FRIENDS THE CREW I GREW UP WITH MOST GOT WHAT THE
trainval/5AN5fPFtV0U/50022 THAT'S THE LEVEL OF CHARACTERS I HUNG OUT WITH
trainval/5AN5fPFtV0U/50023 I'VE GOT A BEAUTIFUL WIFE THEY WANT TO TEST THAT
trainval/5c6AADI7Pb4/50001 SOME PEOPLE CALLED HIM A MORON
trainval/5c6AADI7Pb4/50002 YOU'RE LOCKED OUT OF YOUR CAR
trainval/5c6AADI7Pb4/50003 IT'S 11 O'CLOCK AT NIGHT
trainval/5c6AADI7Pb4/50004 YOU'RE IN A BAD NEIGHBORHOOD
trainval/5c6AADI7Pb4/50006 THIS IS A NATIONAL SECURITY PROBLEM
trainval/5c6AADI7Pb4/50007 THEY SAID THEY WOULD FIX IT THEN TURN IT BACK ON
trainval/5cQoGNEcc5Q/50001 BUT AS YOU GO DOWN THE ARM TOWARDS THE HANDS THE TOUCH GETS MORE
trainval/5cQoGNEcc5Q/50002 SOUND FAMILIAR ANYONE
trainval/5cQoGNEcc5Q/50003 SO AS PART OF MY QUEST TO HELP PEOPLE BECOME BETTER FLIRTS I DID RESEARCH
trainval/5cQoGNEcc5Q/50004 IT MEANS THAT YOU'RE NOT SO SELF CONSCIOUS THAT YOU CAN'T OBSERVE THE EFFECT THAT YOU'RE HAVING ON THE OTHER PERSON
trainval/5cQoGNEcc5Q/50005 IT'S THINGS TO DO RATHER THAN HOW WE OFTEN SEE FLIRTING WHICH IS A
trainval/5CSDIcUsIJk/50001 AND WITH HIS ENCOURAGEMENT AT AGE 34 I DECIDED TO GO AFTER KONA
trainval/5CSDIcUsIJk/50002 THAT'S RIGHT IT'S A TOTAL DISTANCE OF 140
trainval/5CSDIcUsIJk/50003 THERE WAS NO WAY I WAS GOING TO MAKE THAT SWIM IN MY TIME LIMIT OF 10 AND A HALF HOURS BECAUSE I WAS
trainval/5CSDIcUsIJk/50004 MANY PEOPLE WHO CONTRACT POLIO IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME MEDICAL CARE
trainval/5CSDIcUsIJk/50005 BY 4PM I HAD MADE IT TO MILE 94 AND I DID THE MATH AND I REALIZED
trainval/5CSDIcUsIJk/50006 I CRIED THE ENTIRE WAY HOME
trainval/5d4ZEgZU9Aw/50001 A COUPLE IN THE BACK
trainval/5d4ZEgZU9Aw/50002 WHAT ARE THEY
trainval/5Dn08yo9aiM/50001 SO I'M HERE TO CHANGE THAT
trainval/5Dn08yo9aiM/50002 AND BECAUSE WE'VE SPENT SO MUCH TIME WORKING ON BOTH OF THOSE CHARACTERISTICS WE HAVE A COMMUNITY THAT
trainval/5Dn08yo9aiM/50003 YOU GET TO SPEAK ON THE TED STAGE
trainval/5Dn08yo9aiM/50004 YOU GET TO BE CONSIDERED FOR TED
trainval/5Dn08yo9aiM/50005 COM FELLOW SPEAKERS FROM MARCH 70 OF THEM ARE ON TED
trainval/5Dn08yo9aiM/50006 AND BASICALLY HAVING TED FELLOWS ON YOUR RESUME MEANS YOU CAN OPEN THE DOOR PLACES WHERE YOU
trainval/5Dn08yo9aiM/50007 TWO OF THE OTHER OUTCOMES WE'VE HAD
trainval/5duz42kHqPs/50001 WHAT VOCABULARY AM I SUPPOSED TO USE
trainval/5duz42kHqPs/50002 SO HERE'S THE STATE OF THINGS
trainval/5duz42kHqPs/50003 I'D LIKE TO START BY TELLING YOU A STORY ABOUT ZAYA
trainval/5duz42kHqPs/50004 ALL WE HAVE ARE THE QUESTIONS
trainval/5EORxJsoUJQ/50001 AND SHE REPLIED WELL I HAVE NEVER BEEN TAUGHT TO ASK FOR CONSENT
trainval/5ErKrSyUpEo/50001 AND IN OUR MOST PAINFUL MOMENTS IN THE FACE OF THE FIRES OF INJUSTICE I HAVE
trainval/5ErKrSyUpEo/50002 THE CONTRACTIONS ARE LESS THAN A MINUTE APART
trainval/5ErKrSyUpEo/50003 PAPA JI DRIED MY TEARS GAVE ME THE WORDS OF GURU NANAK THE FOUNDER OF THE SIKH
trainval/5ErKrSyUpEo/50004 I WILL REFUSE TO HATE THEM EVEN WHEN THEY HATE ME
trainval/5ErKrSyUpEo/50005 I WILL EVEN VOW TO PROTECT THEM WHEN THEY ARE IN HARM'S WAY
trainval/5ErKrSyUpEo/50006 THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A SIKH S I K H
trainval/5ErKrSyUpEo/50007 MY GRANDFATHER SAW ME AS A WARRIOR
trainval/5ErKrSyUpEo/50008 WHEN RIGHT WING NATIONALIST MOVEMENTS ARE ON THE RISE AROUND THE GLOBE AND HAVE CAPTURED THE PRESIDENCY OF THE
trainval/5ErKrSyUpEo/50009 INDIGENOUS PEOPLE SAVAGE
trainval/5ErKrSyUpEo/50010 WHEN EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND NEWS OF VIOLENCE HITS OUR BODIES HARD
trainval/5ErKrSyUpEo/50011 BREATHE SHE SAYS
trainval/5ErKrSyUpEo/50012 IF WE DON'T BREATHE WE WILL DIE
trainval/5ErKrSyUpEo/50013 REVOLUTIONARY LOVE REQUIRES US TO BREATHE AND PUSH THROUGH THE FIRE WITH A WARRIOR'S HEART AND
trainval/5FjuSwOaV3Y/50001 BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A DEVICE TO GO UP IN THE TREES
trainval/5FjuSwOaV3Y/50002 AND YET HERE WE ARE TODAY ABOUT HALF OF THE RAINFOREST REMAINS AND WE HAVE POTENTIALLY MORE URGENT PROBLEMS LIKE CLIMATE
trainval/5FjuSwOaV3Y/50003 THEY CAN LISTEN TO THE SOUNDS OF THE FOREST
trainval/5FjuSwOaV3Y/50004 WHAT WE SAW WAS THAT PEOPLE THROUGHOUT ASIA PEOPLE THROUGHOUT AFRICA THROUGHOUT SOUTH AMERICA THEY TOLD US
trainval/5FjuSwOaV3Y/50005 I GOT AN EMAIL ON MY PHONE
trainval/5FjuSwOaV3Y/50006 ACTUALLY WE HAD JUST CLIMBED THE TREE
trainval/5FjuSwOaV3Y/50007 EVERYONE HAD JUST GOTTEN BACK DOWN
trainval/5ftklsHZ4cU/50001 AND IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT ABOUT HYDRO ELECTRIC
trainval/5ftklsHZ4cU/50002 FUEL ROD ASSEMBLY IS ONLY ABOUT THIS BIG
trainval/5ftklsHZ4cU/50003 WE KNOW WHAT CARBON DIOXIDE IS DOING WE KNOW HOW IT IS GLOBALLY CHANGING OUR
trainval/5ftklsHZ4cU/50004 AND SO I STARTED THINKING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM THIS VERY VERY CHALLENGING PROBLEM ELEMENTS THAT BEHAVE VERY VERY
trainval/5Gtw7hgyLzI/50001 I AM ALSO AN AUTHOR
trainval/5Gtw7hgyLzI/50002 SO I'VE WRITTEN SEVERAL BOOKS
trainval/5HeZaYtfDf8/50001 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
trainval/5HeZaYtfDf8/50002 BUT ONCE IN A WHILE CANCERS GET THE ABILITY TO EXPRESS THESE NEW SUGARS AND NOW THAT WE
trainval/5HL1BEC024g/50001 IT'S STILL THERMALLY HOT BUT IT'S NOT RADIOACTIVE
trainval/5HL1BEC024g/50002 IT'S A WAY TO BRING POWER TO THE DEVELOPING WORLD BECAUSE IT'S PRODUCED IN A FACTORY AND IT'S CHEAP
trainval/5HL1BEC024g/50003 THAT'S SOMEONE WHO IS DESIGNING A HABITAT ON ANOTHER PLANET'S DREAM
trainval/5HL1BEC024g/50004 THAT'S A TON OF POWER
trainval/5HL1BEC024g/50005 SO I'M REALLY EXCITED
trainval/5iqZzi9mj4M/50001 MY PARENTS ARE BOTH HIGHLY EDUCATED AND LIBERAL PEOPLE MY BACKGROUND WAS NOT RELIGIOUS NOR
trainval/5iqZzi9mj4M/50002 I LEARNED HOW TO KEEP THE BALANCE BETWEEN WHAT IS EXPECTED FROM ME BY MY SURROUNDINGS AND WHAT I REALLY WANTED IN
trainval/5iqZzi9mj4M/50003 I CAN FINALLY DROP THE BALANCING ACT AND START LIVING MY LIFE RIGHT
trainval/5iqZzi9mj4M/50004 THEY WERE CONVINCED I WAS A TOOL IN THE HANDS OF THE ISRAELI PROPAGANDA
trainval/5iqZzi9mj4M/50005 EVERYTHING IS IN PLACE EVERYTHING IS IN HARMONY IN FLOW
trainval/5iqZzi9mj4M/50006 YOU TAKE OUT ONE EIGHTH
trainval/5J6jAC6XxAI/50001 IT RUNS IN MY FAMILY
trainval/5J6jAC6XxAI/50002 THIS DECREASES EMOTIONAL REACTIVITY WHICH CAN BE A SUPERPOWER
trainval/5J6jAC6XxAI/50003 I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS DOING
trainval/5J6jAC6XxAI/50004 I WENT FROM DECIDING TO FULL BLOWN PLANNING VERY QUICKLY
trainval/5J6jAC6XxAI/50005 FOR THE IRS BIT I COULD CHANGE THE MAILING ADDRESS ON FILE WITH THE IRS SO THE PAPERWORK WOULD GO TO MY ACCOUNTANT
trainval/5J6jAC6XxAI/50006 THEN WE GO TO REPAIR
trainval/5J6jAC6XxAI/50007 ANY FURTHER OUT IT STARTS TO SEEM INTANGIBLE
trainval/5J6jAC6XxAI/50008 AND I CAN TRACE ALL OF MY BIGGEST WINS AND ALL OF MY BIGGEST DISASTERS AVERTED
trainval/5J6jAC6XxAI/50009 HE LOST HIS CAREER AS A FIREFIGHTER
trainval/5J6jAC6XxAI/50010 HE WAS THEN THREATENED
trainval/5J6jAC6XxAI/50011 HE AND HIS WIFE HAD TO FLEE POLAND BOUNCE FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY UNTIL THEY LANDED IN THE US WITH NEXT TO NOTHING
trainval/5J6jAC6XxAI/50012 I SENT HIM A TEXT A FEW WEEKS AGO ASKING HIM HAD HE EVER READ ANY STOIC PHILOSOPHY
trainval/5J6jAC6XxAI/50013 THIS IS VERY UNLIKE HIM
trainval/5J6jAC6XxAI/50014 WHAT MIGHT BE THE BENEFITS OF SAY A BASE HIT
trainval/5Jqk1rkuUwU/50001 A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID
trainval/5Jqk1rkuUwU/50002 WHO HAD SOMETHING NEGATIVE ON THE SIGN
trainval/5Jqk1rkuUwU/50003 HE DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE HER MATCHES
trainval/5Jqk1rkuUwU/50004 WHAT ABSOLUTE RUBBISH
trainval/5Jqk1rkuUwU/50005 I THINK IT'S UNFAIR
trainval/5Jqk1rkuUwU/50006 SO I DEFINE CHUTZPAH VERY DIFFERENTLY
trainval/5Jqk1rkuUwU/50007 WE'RE NEVER GOING TO ESCAPE
trainval/5Jqk1rkuUwU/50008 WILL YOU MAKE A WIND TURBINE LOOK PRETTY
trainval/5Jqk1rkuUwU/50011 I DON'T EVEN CARE IF IT DOESN'T PRODUCE ELECTRICITY
trainval/5Jqk1rkuUwU/50012 I'M HERE TO SELL YOU CHUTZPAH YOUR OWN CHUTZPAH
trainval/5Jqk1rkuUwU/50013 AND THE CRITICS HATED IT BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A JOKE HE WAS PLAYING ON THEM
trainval/5Jqk1rkuUwU/50014 LET'S GET PRACTICAL
trainval/5Jqk1rkuUwU/50016 BECAUSE YOU NEED TO
trainval/5Jqk1rkuUwU/50017 UNPRINCIPLED PEOPLE ALREADY HAVE PLENTY OF CHUTZPAH DON'T WORRY ABOUT THEM
trainval/5Jqk1rkuUwU/50018 AND IT TAKES CHUTZPAH TO STOP BELIEVING THEM AND MAKE A BREAKTHROUGH
trainval/5Jqk1rkuUwU/50019 TWO SEPARATE FACTS
trainval/5Jqk1rkuUwU/50020 PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TURBINES
trainval/5Jqk1rkuUwU/50021 THAT'S A FACT
trainval/5Jqk1rkuUwU/50022 AND TURBINES ARE UGLY
trainval/5Jqk1rkuUwU/50023 THAT'S A FACT
trainval/5Jqk1rkuUwU/50024 SO WE STARTED TO CHALLENGE THESE FACTS
trainval/5Jqk1rkuUwU/50025 IT'S ALWAYS BEEN TRUE UP UNTIL NOW BUT DID MOSES COME DOWN FROM MT
trainval/5Jqk1rkuUwU/50026 NO NOT TRUE
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50002 AND MY DAUGHTER THINK THIS IS HYSTERICAL BY THE WAY
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50003 NOTHING THAT A NETWORK NEWS PROGRAM WHATEVER PUT ON TV BUT MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50004 AND SOMETIMES I GET INTO MY HEAD TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THEM ABOUT WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE BEFORE THE
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50005 SOUNDED LIKE A GREAT IDEA RIGHT
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50006 VERY LITTLE RASCALS OUR GANG STYLE
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50007 I KNEW I WAS SERIOUS ABOUT IT BECAUSE I WENT INTO MY DAD'S WARDROBE CLOSET TOOK OUT LIKE HIS BEST SHIRT I'M SURE HE WAS THRILLED
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50008 I STILL CAN'T TIE WHEN I WAS 10 IT MUST HAVE BEEN WORSE
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50009 WHAT IS ONE PERCENT OF A BILLION
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50010 IT'S 10 MILLION
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50011 I MEAN TO A KID GROWING UP IN THE 1970S TELEVISION WAS A KIND OF MEDIA GOD I GUESS YOU COULD
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50012 I WAS JOKING EARLIER IF YOU TAKE A BIG STAR LIKE AN EDDY MURPHY SOMEBODY WHO REQUIRED LIKE THEY
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50013 THIS IS WHAT THE NEXT EDDY MURPHY COULD DO THIS IS WHAT YOU COULD CO
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50014 I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THAT FOR AN EARLIER TIME PERIOD
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50015 LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50016 WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WHEN FIVE YEARS FROM NOW TEN YEARS FORM
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50017 THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY DIFFERENT
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50018 WE'RE LIVING IN AN ERA WHERE MEDIA IS TRANSITIONING FROM A SORT OF AN ARISTOCRATIC
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50019 WHAT THAT MEANS IS YOU'RE LIVING IN THE FIRST ERA EVER WHERE YOU CAN DECIDE TO BE A PART OF MEDIA
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50020 THE REAL TRANSFORMATION HERE IS THAT MEDIA HAS BEEN DEMOCRATIZED
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50021 ACCESS TO AN AUDIENCE HAS BEEN DEMOCRATIZED
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50022 AND THIS IS EXTREMELY UNUSUAL I MEAN YOU GO BACK INTO HISTORY
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50023 IF THEY DON'T LIKE YOUR ARTICLE THE WAY YOU WROTE THEY'LL REJECT IT
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50024 THAT'S WHAT'S DIFFERENT NOW
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50025 NOW YOU CAN'T BE CANCELED
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50026 NOW YOU CAN'T HAVE ACCESS TO AN AUDIENCE SHUTDOWN
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50027 BUT THEY HAVEN'T SHUT YOU DOWN IF THEY DON'T DO THAT NOW THAT'S WHAT'S DIFFERENT THAN BEFORE
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50028 WE ARE LIVING THROUGH A TIME THAT IS A CREATIVITY REVOLUTION
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50029 SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT IMMORTALITY IN A SENSE AND THE ABILITY TO GO AND CREATE SOMETHING AND
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50030 MIGHT NOT BE AS GOOD AS OFTEN AS THE PROFESSIONAL STUFF BUT YOU'D BE ABLE TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF
trainval/5K57kcs15DY/50031 THEY'LL GET A HALF MILLION PEOPLE WATCHING THAT SHOW AND IT'LL BE A DISASTER
trainval/5l4cA8zSreQ/50001 THEY HAVE DIGITIZED MILLIONS OF BOOKS
trainval/5l4cA8zSreQ/50002 IF YOU DO THAT YOU MIGHT THINK OH GREAT
trainval/5l4cA8zSreQ/50003 WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE
trainval/5ldhLuX4vSM/50001 WELL NOT QUITE
trainval/5LgCl7ZyYGs/50001 I WAS NOT FAZED BY OTHERS' LACK OF COMPASSION
trainval/5LgCl7ZyYGs/50002 AND QUITE HONESTLY I ALMOST EXPECT NO ONE TO HELP HER
trainval/5LgCl7ZyYGs/50003 AND IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE DIFFICULT IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE SHOWN MONUMENTAL ACTS OF
trainval/5LgCl7ZyYGs/50004 AS THE HUMAN RACE DEVELOPS AT ASTONISHING RATE MY GENERATION SUFFERS
trainval/5LgCl7ZyYGs/50005 DURING MY SOPHOMORE YEAR MY FRIENDS AND I WERE CATCHING THE BUS DOWN TO KIHEI TO GO TO THE BEACH
trainval/5LgCl7ZyYGs/50006 HOWEVER INSTEAD OF IMMEDIATELY GIVING IT TO HER I DEBATED IT FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES THINKING THE MOST
trainval/5LgCl7ZyYGs/50007 WHAT IF WITH THIS LACK OF COMPASSION AND RANDOM ACTS OF KINDNESS COMES THE LACK OF CONCERN AND NEED TO
trainval/5LgCl7ZyYGs/50008 TODAY I ENCOURAGE EACH EVERY ONE OF YOU
trainval/5LrThfSBeq0/50001 THEY DON'T WANT TO BEFRIEND ONE ANOTHER
trainval/5LrThfSBeq0/50002 THEY DON'T WANT TO DATE ONE ANOTHER
trainval/5LrThfSBeq0/50003 IF THEY DO IF THEY FIND OUT THEY FIND EACH OTHER LESS ATTRACTIVE AND THEY MORE AND MORE DON'T
trainval/5LrThfSBeq0/50004 THEY INCREASINGLY WALL THEMSELVES OFF IN THESE IDEOLOGICAL SILOS CONSUMING DIFFERENT
trainval/5LrThfSBeq0/50005 59 PERCENT OF THEM MADE ARGUMENTS IN TERMS OF ONE OF THE MORE CONSERVATIVE MORAL VALUES AND JUST EIGHT PERCENT
trainval/5LrThfSBeq0/50006 IN ONE OF THESE EXPERIMENTS WE RECRUITED LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES TO A STUDY WHERE THEY READ ONE OF
trainval/5M3Dow20KlM/50001 AND IT'S BEEN REALLY FUN SINCE WE PUT THEM UP TO SEE WHERE THESE HAVE GONE
trainval/5MgBikgcWnY/50001 AND EVENTUALLY BECOMING PRETTY GOOD AT SOMETHING
trainval/5MgBikgcWnY/50002 ERICSSON WAS ACTUALLY SAYING IS IT TAKES 10000 HOURS TO GET AT THE TOP OF AN ULTRA
trainval/5MgBikgcWnY/50003 IT'S NOT TRUE
trainval/5MgBikgcWnY/50004 I HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT THOSE ON
trainval/5nrn5fC001Q/50001 BECAUSE WHILE SOME TRANSGENDERED PEOPLE CHOOSE TO DO ONE OR ALL OF THESE THINGS NONE OF THEM ARE A
trainval/5nrn5fC001Q/50002 I GREW UP IN UPSTATE NEW YORK I WENT TO PRIVATE SCHOOL FOR MOST OF MY LIFE ON FINANCIAL AID BEFORE I TRANSFERRED TO
trainval/5nrn5fC001Q/50003 I DABBLED IN A LOT OF SPORTS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL BEFORE SETTLING ON FENCING AROUND 8TH GRADE
trainval/5nrn5fC001Q/50004 AND I DID THAT ON AN ELITE LEVEL COMPETING FOR THE U
trainval/5nrn5fC001Q/50005 FOR FIVE YEARS
trainval/5nrn5fC001Q/50006 I WAS RECRUITED BY THE AIRFORCE ACADEMY AND AFTER FOUR YEARS WENT TO PENN STATE FOR MY MASTER'S
trainval/5nrn5fC001Q/50007 BUT BASED ON THE TWELVE LABELS I'VE ASSIGNED TO THEM YOU MAKE A JUDGEMENT ABOUT WHO THEY ARE YOU DECIDE WHO THEY MAY BE
trainval/5nrn5fC001Q/50008 AS AN EXAGGERATED EXAMPLE NEARLY HALF OF THE WORLD IDENTIFIES AS FEMALE
trainval/5nrn5fC001Q/50009 AND YET WE WOULDN'T BEGIN TO BELIEVE THEY'RE ALL THE SAME SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY IDENTIFY WITH THAT SAME LABEL
trainval/5nrn5fC001Q/50010 I'M HUMAN ONE OF ABOUT 7 BILLION OF US ON THIS PLANET RIGHT NOW
trainval/5nrn5fC001Q/50011 AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE I MAY BE WRONG I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO GOT THAT MASTER'S DEGREE FROM PENN STATE
trainval/5nrn5fC001Q/50012 AND WHILE WE SHARE A COMMUNITY WITH A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WE SHARE A SUBCOMMUNITY WITH FEWER AND FEWER THE
trainval/5nrn5fC001Q/50013 WE SEE A LACK OF DIVERSITY CAUSING ISSUES LIKE OSCARSSOWHITE
trainval/5nrn5fC001Q/50014 AND IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO HEAR PEOPLE SAY THINGS LIKE THE COLOUR OF THEIR SKIN SHOULDN'T MATTER OR I DON'T SEE GENDER
trainval/5nrn5fC001Q/50015 AND BY OPENING THOSE DIALOGUES AND TALKING ABOUT THOSE EXPERIENCES WE ALLOW OURSELVES TO LEARN FROM THE
trainval/5nrn5fC001Q/50016 BUT HEARING HIM SAY THAT TRIGGERS A REACTION IN THAT CAVEMAN PART OF YOUR BRAIN THAT'S TRYING TO KEEP YOU SAFE AND IT MADE ME
trainval/5nwSjRA3kQA/50001 THEY CHANGED SOMETHING
trainval/5OISkgjSjkA/50001 AND WE WENT TO EVERYONE WE COULD THINK OF
trainval/5OISkgjSjkA/50002 WE WENT TO TINY CHARITIES LIKE THE RESUSCITATION COUNCIL UK
trainval/5OISkgjSjkA/50003 IT WAS THAT CLOSE
trainval/5OISkgjSjkA/50004 AND WE THROW YOU RIGHT IN AT THE DEEP END
trainval/5OISkgjSjkA/50005 SO LET'S LOOK AT THE FIRST CHOICE THAT YOU COME ACROSS IN THE FIRST FILM
trainval/5OISkgjSjkA/50006 THEY DON'T FORGET COMPLETELY
trainval/5OISkgjSjkA/50007 BUT THEY FORGET TO THE EXTENT THAT IF A CRISIS REALLY HAPPENS THEY DON'T ACTUALLY
trainval/5OISkgjSjkA/50008 THERE WILL BE SCREAMING
trainval/5OISkgjSjkA/50009 THERE WILL BE SHOUTING
trainval/5OISkgjSjkA/50010 THERE WILL BE BLOOD
trainval/5OISkgjSjkA/50011 THERE WILL BE PANIC
trainval/5OISkgjSjkA/50012 IT WILL NOT BE AT ALL NICE OR POLITE
trainval/5OISkgjSjkA/50013 IF THERE'S A CRISIS THEY JUST HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO
trainval/5OISkgjSjkA/50014 AND SO OF COURSE THEY CAN'T HELP
trainval/5OISkgjSjkA/50015 BECAUSE IT'S SO DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THEY'VE SEEN BEFORE THAT THEY JUST CAN'T HELP
trainval/5OISkgjSjkA/50016 AND SO THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING
trainval/5OISkgjSjkA/50017 IF YOU LOSE THEN THE VICTIM DIES YOU GO BACK A BIT YOU TRY AGAIN
trainval/5OISkgjSjkA/50018 AND SO THE WHOLE THING JUST COLLAPSES HORRIBLY
trainval/5OISkgjSjkA/50020 AND SO IT BECOMES MUCH MORE EMOTIONALLY INVOLVING
trainval/5OISkgjSjkA/50021 MUCH MORE GRIPPING
trainval/5OISkgjSjkA/50022 OKAY NOW LIFESAVER IS AN IDEA
trainval/5OISkgjSjkA/50023 WE NATURALLY WANT TO DO LIFESAVER FOR GERMANY FOR THE UNITED STATES FOR CHINA
trainval/5OISkgjSjkA/50024 WE ALSO WANT TO DO 12 MOST COMMON EMERGENCIES
trainval/5OISkgjSjkA/50025 EVERYTHING FROM DROWNING TO CAR CRASH
trainval/5OISkgjSjkA/50026 WE WANT TO DO ONE ABOUT WOMEN'S PERSONAL SAFETY
trainval/5OqqAKHfHv8/50001 I THINK A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE TALKED TODAY HAVE ALREADY GIVEN GREAT EXAMPLES OF THAT AND I AM GOING TO ADD MY
trainval/5OqqAKHfHv8/50002 SHE WAS HAVING HER PERIOD
trainval/5OqqAKHfHv8/50003 BUT OVER TIME BECAUSE I DIDN'T AVOID THAT SENSE OF SHAME I LEARNT FROM IT
trainval/5OqqAKHfHv8/50004 BECAUSE THEY'RE REMINDERS THAT MIDNIGHT RUNS AREN'T PERMANENT SOLUTIONS THEY AREN'T INTENDED TO BE PERMANENT SOLUTIONS
trainval/5p0ptQizXjg/50001 BUT WHAT DOES MAKE THEM SO DIFFERENT
trainval/5p0ptQizXjg/50002 THE FLOCK OF BIRDS I MENTIONED BEFORE IS BEAUTIFUL IN SO MANY WAYS
trainval/5p0ptQizXjg/50003 WHAT MAKES THIS EVER SO BEAUTIFUL SHAPE THAT OUR EYES ARE NATURALLY DRAWN TO
trainval/5pGWV4KBDUs/50001 THROUGHOUT THIS I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UNSUNG HEROES AND INVISIBLE ANGELS TO BRING INNOVATIVE E
trainval/5PhNVxr7Vtw/50001 HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU BEEN IN LECTURE HALLS LIKE THIS ONE
trainval/5PhNVxr7Vtw/50002 SO ONE APPROACH MIGHT BE TO TELL EVERY PROFESSOR OUT THERE YOU NEED TO SPEND A COUPLE OF HOURS WITH EACH STUDENT ONE ON
trainval/5PhNVxr7Vtw/50003 IT SOUNDS KIND OF FUNNY RIGHT
trainval/5PhNVxr7Vtw/50004 WHAT DO YOU DO
trainval/5PhNVxr7Vtw/50005 YOU HAVE A CONVERSATION
trainval/5PhNVxr7Vtw/50006 WHAT ARE YOU STRUGGLING WITH
trainval/5pIGDw18mIQ/50001 BUT I THINK THIS MAYBE BE ONE OF THE THINGS MACARTHUR MEANT WHEN HE SAID THAT
trainval/5pIGDw18mIQ/50002 THE SECOND IS THAT LEADERS ARE EXPECTED TO FADE AWAY WHETHER OR NOT IT IS LABELED AS SUCH
trainval/5pIGDw18mIQ/50003 EGO IS ONE OF THESE THINGS THAT'S A GOOD SERVANT AND A TERRIBLE MASTER
trainval/5pIGDw18mIQ/50004 AND IN A WONDERFUL ALCHEMY WHAT I'VE GIVEN AWAY HAS GIVEN ME STABILITY FROM WHICH I CAN VIEW
trainval/5pW2b1vwwf4/50001 I'LL EVEN TELL IT TO YOU NOW
trainval/5pW2b1vwwf4/50002 BECAUSE WE'VE ALL BEEN PROGRAMMED
trainval/5pW2b1vwwf4/50003 I WANTED TO KEEP MY FATHER HAPPY SO I SACRIFICED MY BIGGEST PASSION FOR PERFORMING TO BECOME A
trainval/5pXelS1clHs/50001 I'D LIKE TO MAKE A DISTINCTION
trainval/5pXelS1clHs/50002 THEY ASK A LOT OF WHY
trainval/5pXelS1clHs/50003 WHAT'S IMPLIED IN THAT
trainval/5pXelS1clHs/50004 DON'T TRY TO BE SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT
trainval/5pXelS1clHs/50005 OKAY BUT WHERE DO YOUR VALUES COME FROM
trainval/5pXelS1clHs/50006 AND YOU STAY STUCK
trainval/5pXelS1clHs/50007 PEOPLE TALK ABOUT OH THERE WAS BREAKTHROUGH
trainval/5pXelS1clHs/50008 WHERE DOES IT COME FROM
trainval/5pXelS1clHs/50009 THIS ISN'T FOR THE YOU KNOW THE ACADEMIC INTELLECTUAL IN THE IVY TOWERS OF THE GREATEST UNIVERSITIES OF THE
trainval/5pXelS1clHs/50010 AND IT BECOMES A RECURRING OR A REDUNDANT PATTERN IN LIFE
trainval/5pXelS1clHs/50011 IN ESSENCE ETHICS ASKS THE QUESTION
trainval/5pXelS1clHs/50012 IT GETS KIND OF COMPLICATED
trainval/5pXelS1clHs/50013 OKAY SO THAT'S YOUR VIEW OF REALITY
trainval/5pXelS1clHs/50014 SO WHAT'S THE NEXT BRANCH
trainval/5pXelS1clHs/50015 SO NOW WHAT SHOULD I DO
trainval/5pXelS1clHs/50016 CONTRAST THAT WITH A DIFFERENT VIEW THAT SAYS
trainval/5pXelS1clHs/50017 WHAT MAKES YOU DIFFERENT THAN EVERY OTHER FORM OF ANIMAL ON THE PLANET IS THE FACT THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE A
trainval/5qdZybHSLnI/50001 I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO WITH MY FUTURE
trainval/5qdZybHSLnI/50002 SO WITH THIS OLYMPUS OM 10 CAMERA I ACTUALLY TAUGHT MYSELF PHOTOGRAPHY LYING IN A HOSPITAL BED
trainval/5qdZybHSLnI/50003 I USED TO PHOTOGRAPH THE DOCTORS NURSES MY FRIENDS ANYONE WHO WOULD COME IN
trainval/5qdZybHSLnI/50004 I WAS THE WORLD'S WORST BOXER
trainval/5qdZybHSLnI/50005 ANOTHER THING THAT I'D GROWN INCREASINGLY CYNICAL ABOUT WAS THE WAY WOMEN WERE PORTRAYED IN THE MAGAZINES I WORKED FOR
trainval/5qdZybHSLnI/50006 I WAS LISTENING TO THIS ARGUMENT AND I SUDDENLY THOUGHT THIS IS NOT WHY I BECAME A PHOTOGRAPHER
trainval/5qdZybHSLnI/50007 HE SAID GILES YOU TAKE A PUNCH VERY WELL
trainval/5qdZybHSLnI/50008 AS THE MONTHS WENT ON I HAD 37 OPERATIONS IN MY FIRST YEAR AND THROUGH THAT RECOVERY AGAIN I WATCHED THE
trainval/5qdZybHSLnI/50009 AS I STARTED MY REHABILITATION AS I WAS WORKING TO WALK AGAIN THE ONLY THING ON MY MIND WAS I HAD
trainval/5qdZybHSLnI/50010 TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT LAST YEAR DURING THE EUROPEAN REFUGEE CRISIS CLOSE TO A MILLION
trainval/5qdZybHSLnI/50011 I WAS MOSTLY INTERESTED IN THE MOST VULNERABLE THOSE WITH DISABILITIES THE ELDERLY SINGLE MOTHERS
trainval/5qdZybHSLnI/50012 BUT AS YOU'LL LEARN I'M QUITE A STUBBORN CHARACTER AND I WASN'T SURE THAT MY LACK OF SPORTING ABILITY WOULDN'T GET IN THE
trainval/5qdZybHSLnI/50013 THEY WOULD COME IN AND LIFT HER HAND AND PUT IT ON THE WOUND AND SAY MAKE IT BETTER MUMMY
trainval/5qdZybHSLnI/50015 THEN I ALSO DISCOVERED THAT AYA WAS NOT A VICTIM
trainval/5qdZybHSLnI/50016 WHEN IMAN WALKED IN SHE SHOUTED HEY DONKEY PICK ME UP
trainval/5qdZybHSLnI/50017 ON THE LAST DAY I WAS THERE I GOT A PHONE CALL
trainval/5qdZybHSLnI/50018 I SAID WHERE IS SHE
trainval/5qdZybHSLnI/50019 THEY SAID SHE'S IN THE SAME TENT WHERE YOU LAST SAW HER
trainval/5qdZybHSLnI/50020 THE REFUGEE CRISIS AFFECTS ALL OF US
trainval/5qdZybHSLnI/50021 I SAY THE BIGGEST STRUGGLE IS THAT IN THOSE CAMPS I SEE HUMANITY I SEE LOVE I SEE COMPASSION
trainval/5qdZybHSLnI/50022 EVERY DAY POLITICIANS USE NEGATIVE RHETORIC FOR THEIR OWN
trainval/5qdZybHSLnI/50023 A PHOTOGRAPH THAT YOU TOOK IN AFGHANISTAN INSPIRED ME AND EVERY DAY I HAD THAT PHOTOGRAPH ON MY WALL
trainval/5qdZybHSLnI/50024 THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS
trainval/5QGApheKRc0/50001 IS A TOTALLY REASONABLE QUESTION
trainval/5QGApheKRc0/50002 JUMPING TO PRE AGRICULTURAL HUMANS 50000 YEARS AGO OR SO WE TOOK IN ENERGY AS
trainval/5QGApheKRc0/50003 WELL I CAN TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT IT FELT LIKE IN THE PRE ZEUS ERA
trainval/5QGApheKRc0/50004 WITH ENERGY A KEY PROBLEM IS THAT WE'VE GROWN HABITUATED TO HAVING SUCH A FABULOUS RELIABLE
trainval/5QGApheKRc0/50005 AND THAT DEPENDENCY ONLY SHOWS ITSELF WHEN ENERGY'S GONE WHEN THE POWER GOES OUT AND YOU FIND YOURSELF EATING A COLD
trainval/5QTjSH1KGlY/50001 YEP THAT WAS IT
trainval/5RLqVpo3j20/50001 WHAT IS A GOPRO
trainval/5s61n2MLGRQ/50001 THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE STEM FROM IDEAS RIGHT
trainval/5s61n2MLGRQ/50002 THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE CONVENTIONAL DON'T LIMIT THEM TO SOLELY CAREERS OR JOBS BUT JUST REMEMBER THAT IF
trainval/5s61n2MLGRQ/50003 ONE OF MY FAVORITE QUOTES FROM WALT DISNEY
trainval/5s61n2MLGRQ/50004 YOU SAID THAT LAST WEEK
trainval/5s61n2MLGRQ/50005 MIGHT MAKE IT MY NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION
trainval/5s61n2MLGRQ/50006 HOW'S THAT WORKING OUT
trainval/5SOHiN8Ne58/50001 THE BUILDING BEHIND ME IS LOCATED AT PENN STATE UNIVERSITY
trainval/5SOHiN8Ne58/50002 BUT SHE'S SILENT
trainval/5SOHiN8Ne58/50003 LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A PROBLEM YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE
trainval/5SOHiN8Ne58/50004 COVER YOUR LEMON OKAY
trainval/5SOHiN8Ne58/50005 IN THE FORMS OF RUMOR
trainval/5SOHiN8Ne58/50006 COVER YOUR LEMON AND BE KIND TO PEOPLE
trainval/5SOHiN8Ne58/50007 IT'S ONLY THEN THAT WE GIVE UP CONTROL AND WE ACCIDENTALLY STUMBLE ON THINGS AND WE TEST THINGS WE TAKE
trainval/5SOHiN8Ne58/50008 YOU KNOW AND THERE'S BEAUTY TO BE FOUND IN A MESS
trainval/5SOHiN8Ne58/50009 THINGS LIKE SILLY PUTTY TOTALLY ACCIDENTAL
trainval/5SOHiN8Ne58/50010 I'M NOW FACE TO FACE WITH THE GRUMPY BUTCHER
trainval/5sS3Yjh9Lw4/50001 IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CHOICE THAT DECIDES IF YOU LOSE OR GAIN
trainval/5sS3Yjh9Lw4/50002 NOW ONE NEED NOT BE SOCRATES TO DEFINE THIS WORD ON MY MIND
trainval/5sS3Yjh9Lw4/50003 TO THOSE WARY OF DOING TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE THE MIDDLE BOWL JUTS COMFORTABLY WITH LOTS OF COMPANY
trainval/5sS3Yjh9Lw4/50004 AND SURE THE CONVERSATION MAY BE FAR FROM SPARKLING BUT AT LEAST IT'S SAFE
trainval/5sS3Yjh9Lw4/50005 MEDIOCRITY'S FEATURE THAT'S THE SADDEST ISN'T ITS FAIR TO MIDDLING STATUS
trainval/5sS3Yjh9Lw4/50006 SO THE QUESTION BECOMES
trainval/5sS3Yjh9Lw4/50007 IF ALL THAT WE'RE GIVEN COMES FROM THAT WHICH WE GIVE WHY DO WE OFFER OURSELVES SUCH A PALTRY SUM
trainval/5sS3Yjh9Lw4/50008 LEAVING THIS EARTH TODAY WHAT WOULD BE YOUR LEGACY
trainval/5sS3Yjh9Lw4/50009 WE ARE THE PILLARS OF OUR FAMILIES YET SOME OF US STILL POSSESS NO SELF WORTH
trainval/5sS3Yjh9Lw4/50010 WE NEVER GIVE OURSELVES ENOUGH CREDIT AND WE ALLOW OTHERS TO PUT US DOWN
trainval/5sS3Yjh9Lw4/50011 YOU ARE AN EMPOWERING WOMAN SHARING THE PHENOMENON THAT IS CALLED LOVE
trainval/5sS3Yjh9Lw4/50012 SO I ASK YOU AGAIN WOMAN DO YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE
trainval/5sS3Yjh9Lw4/50013 YOU ARE A MARTYR YOU ARE A QUEEN
trainval/5sS3Yjh9Lw4/50014 YOU ARE A TEACHER AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN
trainval/5sS3Yjh9Lw4/50015 YOU ARE A GIFT TO MANKIND
trainval/5sS3Yjh9Lw4/50016 YOU ARE THE RAREST TREASURE OF ALL TO FIND
trainval/5sS3Yjh9Lw4/50017 YOU ARE AN EMPOWERING WOMAN
trainval/5sS3Yjh9Lw4/50018 THROUGH NO RHYME OR REASON DISCOVERED BECAUSE I FELT I HAD NO CHOICE
trainval/5tal0NkWW1E/50001 THESE ARE WELL MEANING DOCTORS SOME OF THEM HAVE GONE ON TO BECOME VERY GOOD FRIENDS
trainval/5tal0NkWW1E/50002 WELL WE HAVE TWO OBJECTIVE MEASURES
trainval/5tal0NkWW1E/50003 YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T DO THAT
trainval/5TKRSIKtaCg/50001 MY SHRINK SAYS I'VE GOT MARIJUANA PSYCHOSIS
trainval/5TKRSIKtaCg/50002 I WAS BULLIED SO MUCH THAT I BEGAN BULLYING MYSELF TO THE EXTENT I FIRST
trainval/5TKRSIKtaCg/50003 I WAS TAKEN AWAY BY THE POLICE 18 MONTHS LATER
trainval/5TKRSIKtaCg/50004 I BELIEVED ALL THE NEGATIVE THINGS THAT PEOPLE TOLD ME
trainval/5TKRSIKtaCg/50006 I HAD TO LEARN TO SIT WITH THE PAIN OF MY THOUGHTS
trainval/5TKRSIKtaCg/50007 I STOPPED WAITING FOR PEOPLE IN MY LIFE TO GIVE ME THAT ATTENTION AFFECTION APPRECIATION AND
trainval/5tUnSuoYKoE/50001 QUITE QUITE IRONIC
trainval/5tUnSuoYKoE/50002 AND I THINK IT'S NOT AN ACCIDENT THAT YOU DON'T FIND THIS IDEA IN THE VERY ORIGIN OF ISLAM
trainval/5tUnSuoYKoE/50003 MAYBE SOME THINGS ARE BAD TRADITIONS AND THEY NEED TO BE CHANGED
trainval/5tUnSuoYKoE/50004 AND QUITE TELLINGLY SOME MUSLIMS DO PRACTICE IT THE MUSLIMS IN NORTH AFRICA NOT IN OTHER PLACES
trainval/5tUnSuoYKoE/50005 AND I THINK FORCING PEOPLE TO UNCOVER THEIR HEAD IS AS TYRANNICAL AS FORCING THEM TO COVER IT
trainval/5tUnSuoYKoE/50006 AND THERE ARE STRENGTHS IN ISLAMIC TRADITION
trainval/5tUnSuoYKoE/50007 THAT'S WHY THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE IN ITS LAST DECADES TURNED INTO A PROTO DEMOCRACY A
trainval/5tUnSuoYKoE/50008 SIMILARLY IN THE ARAB WORLD THERE WAS WHAT THE GREAT ARAB HISTORIAN ALBERT HOURANI DEFINES AS THE
trainval/5tUnSuoYKoE/50009 IN MY BOOK I WENT INTO THAT QUESTION AS WELL
trainval/5tUnSuoYKoE/50010 SO IN THE 20TH CENTURY YOU HAD THIS VICIOUS CYCLE IN THE ARAB WORLD WHERE YOU HAVE A DICTATORSHIP SUPPRESSING ITS OWN
trainval/5tUnSuoYKoE/50011 TURKEY HAS NEVER BEEN COLONIZED SO IT REMAINED AS AN INDEPENDENT NATION AFTER THE FALL OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE
trainval/5tUnSuoYKoE/50012 THEY SEE AN EXAMPLE AT LEAST TO TAKE SOME INSPIRATION FROM
trainval/5tUnSuoYKoE/50013 ARAB MASSES JUST REVOLTED AGAINST THEIR DICTATORS
trainval/5tUnSuoYKoE/50014 THEY SAID WE WANT FREEDOM WE WANT DEMOCRACY
trainval/5tzEpqDtaPE/50001 I WORRY ABOUT NICOLE AND HER FRIENDS' SAFETY EVERY DAY
trainval/5tzEpqDtaPE/50002 I'M A SAFETY PROFESSIONAL
trainval/5tzEpqDtaPE/50003 I'M A NATIONALLY KNOWN INCIDENT COMMAND INSTRUCTOR
trainval/5tzEpqDtaPE/50004 I'M DAMN GOOD AT MY JOB
trainval/5tzEpqDtaPE/50005 I NEVER HAD TWO SONS
trainval/5tzEpqDtaPE/50006 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS MY SON COULD GO TO A FOOTBALL GAME AND BE SAFE WITHOUT ME
trainval/5tzEpqDtaPE/50007 THE KIDS STARTED WATCHING THE GAME
trainval/5tzEpqDtaPE/50008 KIDS ARE AMAZINGLY RESILIENT
trainval/5tzEpqDtaPE/50009 AND I WAS NO LONGER AT A FOOTBALL GAME
trainval/5UH7uTpTa44/50001 WHAT PAPERWORK DID HE HAVE
trainval/5UH7uTpTa44/50002 AND WHEN WAS HIS NEXT SHIPMENT GOING TO ARRIVE
trainval/5UH7uTpTa44/50003 RELIEF ONLY COMES WHEN YOU TURN THE FIRST CORNER AND GLANCE BEHIND AND THEY'RE NOT STANDING THERE
trainval/5UH7uTpTa44/50004 YOU CAN MAKE 2000 PERCENT SELLING FAKES ONLINE WITH LITTLE OF THE SAME RISKS OR PENALTIES
trainval/5UH7uTpTa44/50005 AND THIS QUICK EASY MONEY THEN GOES ON TO FUND THE MORE SERIOUS TYPES OF CRIME AND IT PAYS THE WAY TO MAKING THESE
trainval/5UH7uTpTa44/50006 FOR A FEW YEARS I ALSO USED TO ATTEND AUTOMOTIVE TRADE SHOWS TAKING PLACE IN HUGE
trainval/5UH7uTpTa44/50007 AND THEY WOULD SELL ME FAKE CAR PARTS FAULTY FAKE CAR PARTS THAT HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED TO CAUSE OVER
trainval/5UH7uTpTa44/50008 COUNTERFEITING IS SET TO BECOME A 2
trainval/5UH7uTpTa44/50009 DID I HAVE A BUSINESS CARD
trainval/5UH7uTpTa44/50010 WHERE WERE THE POLO SHIRTS COMING FROM
trainval/5uVtphj4b6c/50001 IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS BEING HUNGRY TO BEING FULL
trainval/5uVtphj4b6c/50002 BUT TURNS OUT MY BLOOD LEVELS WERE THE BEST THEY'VE EVER BEEN IN A LONG TIME
trainval/5uVtphj4b6c/50003 JUST GOING TO SHOW THAT GOING VEGAN WAS A CHOICE THAT I WILL FOREVER STAND BY
trainval/5uVtphj4b6c/50004 BUT I HOPE I'VE GIVEN YOU SOME FOOD FOR THOUGHT
trainval/5uVtphj4b6c/50005 LEARN WHERE YOUR FOOD IS COMING FROM
trainval/5uVtphj4b6c/50006 IT WAS QUITE DIFFICULT
trainval/5uVtphj4b6c/50007 IT TOOK TIME TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I NEEDED TO CONSUME DAILY
trainval/5uVtphj4b6c/50008 I'D SEE PIZZA AND NEEDED TO HAVE IT
trainval/5uVtphj4b6c/50009 AFTER REALIZING THAT THERE'S A LOT MORE TO VEGAN THAN JUST EATING VEGETABLES I DID RESEARCH AND THAT DEFINITELY GAVE ME THE
trainval/5uVtphj4b6c/50010 BUT PLENTY OF PEOPLE CAN ARGUE THAT VEGANISM ISN'T HEALTHY BECAUSE WELL OREOS ARE VEGAN FROSTED
trainval/5uVtphj4b6c/50011 BUT MY DAILY CALORIES ARE MOSTLY VEGETABLES FRUITS CARBS AND PROTEINS WHILE CONSUMING VERY LITTLE FATS
trainval/5uVtphj4b6c/50012 WHEN I ATE EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING LESS THAN 20 TO 30 PERCENT OF MY DIET WAS FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
trainval/5uVtphj4b6c/50013 BUT NOW OVER 50 PERCENT ARE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
trainval/5uVtphj4b6c/50014 BUT HAVE YOU EVER STOPPED TO THINK WHERE IS THIS FOOD COMING FROM
trainval/5uVtphj4b6c/50015 CHICKEN FISH TURKEY PORK AND BEEF
trainval/5uVtphj4b6c/50016 WHAT EXACTLY AM I EATING AND PUTTING INTO MY BODY
trainval/5uVtphj4b6c/50017 TO COMPARE FROM 1958 TO 2014 THERE HAVE BEEN 548 FATAL SHARK ATTACKS AS SAID
trainval/5uVtphj4b6c/50018 LITTLE CHICKS ARE THROWN INTO GRINDERS ALIVE
trainval/5uVtphj4b6c/50019 WHAT IS IT FOR
trainval/5uVtphj4b6c/50020 IF YOU HAVE A DOG OR A CAT PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND
trainval/5uVtphj4b6c/50021 BUT WHEN SOMEONE EATS THERE ARE SO MANY FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO WHAT GOES INTO THEIR BODIES
trainval/5uVtphj4b6c/50022 AND UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS OF WHAT YOU EAT
trainval/5vXRgT6egSU/50001 PLAY IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THIS DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE AS STUDENTS ARE LEARNING SO MUCH ABOUT THE
trainval/5vXRgT6egSU/50002 EIGHTY PERCENT OF STUDENTS ARE READING AT OR ABOVE GRADE LEVEL BUT
trainval/5Walt8nPINM/50001 DOUBTFIRE FOR EXAMPLE THINGS LIKE THAT
trainval/5Walt8nPINM/50002 SO ON OUR WAY THEY WERE COACHING US AND THEY EXPLAINED THAT THE RESIDENTS WERE GONNA BE SUPER EXCITED TO SEE US
trainval/5Walt8nPINM/50003 IT'S BEEN IN THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION FOR ALMOST 25 YEARS
trainval/5Walt8nPINM/50004 VINCENT WHICH IS A RETIREMENT HOME IN WEST SEATTLE AND THE INTERGENERATIONAL LEARNING CENTER WHICH IS THE
trainval/5Walt8nPINM/50005 AND THAT JUST MADE ME SO CURIOUS TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS MAN AND WHO HE HAD BEEN IN HIS LIFE UP
trainval/5Walt8nPINM/50006 SO I'M MULTITASKING FROM THE TIME I WAKE UP TO THE TIME I GO TO BED AND I AM ALWAYS PRESSED FOR TIME
trainval/5Walt8nPINM/50008 THE STORY GOT PICKED UP BY NEWS OUTLETS ALL OVER THE WORLD
trainval/5Walt8nPINM/50009 I ENDED UP BEING INTERVIEWED FOR TELEVISION AND RADIO AND BLOGS AND PODCASTS
trainval/5XD2kNopsUs/50001 ONE IS KIND OF A PLACE OR A LOCATION OR A ROOM
trainval/5XD2kNopsUs/50002 I'VE BEEN ASKING PEOPLE THIS QUESTION FOR ABOUT 10 YEARS WHERE DO YOU GO WHEN YOU REALLY NEED TO GET SOMETHING DONE
trainval/5XD2kNopsUs/50003 WHY IS THAT HAPPENING
trainval/5XD2kNopsUs/50004 IF YOU'RE INTERRUPTED AND WOKEN UP YOU HAVE TO START AGAIN
trainval/5XD2kNopsUs/50005 WHICH IS RIDICULOUS BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE EXCUSES THAT MANAGERS GIVE
trainval/5XD2kNopsUs/50006 AND I'M ONE OF THESE MANAGERS
trainval/5XD2kNopsUs/50007 I HOPE THAT SOME OF THESE IDEAS WERE AT LEAST PROVOCATIVE ENOUGH FOR MANAGERS AND BOSSES AND BUSINESS
trainval/5XD2kNopsUs/50008 AND MANAGERS ARE BASICALLY PEOPLE WHOSE JOB IT IS TO INTERRUPT PEOPLE
trainval/5XD2kNopsUs/50009 SOME OF YOU MAY WORK AT PLACES WHERE YOU CAN'T GET TO CERTAIN SITES
trainval/5XD2kNopsUs/50010 THEY'RE FOR INTERRUPTING PEOPLE
trainval/5XD2kNopsUs/50011 THAT'S KIND OF BAD
trainval/5XD2kNopsUs/50012 IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY
trainval/5XD2kNopsUs/50013 ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU TELL THEM THEY HAVE TO STOP DOING THAT TO DO SOMETHING ELSE
trainval/5XD2kNopsUs/50014 COMPANIES OFTEN THINK OF A ONE HOUR MEETING AS A ONE HOUR MEETING BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE UNLESS THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON
trainval/5XD2kNopsUs/50015 SO JUST THE AFTERNOON ONE THURSDAY
trainval/5XD2kNopsUs/50016 GIVING SOMEONE FOUR HOURS OF UNINTERRUPTED TIME IS THE BEST GIFT YOU CAN GIVE ANYBODY AT WORK
trainval/5XD2kNopsUs/50017 SO IF YOU'RE A MANAGER START ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO USE MORE THINGS LIKE I
trainval/5Yikqlc7yl8/50001 AND THEN I REMEMBERED JONESTOWN
trainval/5Yikqlc7yl8/50002 CONROY WAS INDIGNANT
trainval/5Yikqlc7yl8/50003 BUT ONE YEAR THEY LOST THE CONTRACT
trainval/5YL3LT1ZvOM/50001 HE JUMPS BACK AND HE GAGS AND WE HAD TO DO IT THREE TIMES {LG}
trainval/5YL3LT1ZvOM/50002 THIS MAKES IT VERY USEFUL AS A STRATEGY IF YOU WANT TO CONVINCE SOMEBODY THAT AN OBJECT OR AN INDIVIDUAL OR AN ENTIRE
trainval/5YL3LT1ZvOM/50003 IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS SCORE IS ACTUALLY MEANINGFUL
trainval/5YL3LT1ZvOM/50004 ANOTHER WAY TO SAY THIS THOUGH IS THAT PEOPLE
trainval/5YL3LT1ZvOM/50005 WHEN HIS GRANDMOTHER'S AWAY HE HAS SEX WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND ON HIS GRANDMA'S BED
trainval/5YL3LT1ZvOM/50006 I MEAN THAT'S PART OF HOW EMOTIONS WORK
trainval/5zuBDgBdyug/50002 THAT MAY NOT SOUND LIKE MUCH BUT IF YOU BUY A STARBUCKS EVERY SINGLE WEEKDAY THAT COSTS 4 POUNDS THAT'S
trainval/5zuBDgBdyug/50003 THE WORST THEY CAN DO IS SAY NO
trainval/5zuBDgBdyug/50004 I'M QUITE LAZY SO I SPEND 3 ON RETURN BUS TO THE STATION EVERY MORNING
trainval/60OVlfAUPJg/50001 AND I THINK THERE ARE SOME CASES
trainval/60OVlfAUPJg/50002 I'LL THINK ABOUT IT ROUGHLY
trainval/60OVlfAUPJg/50003 I DON'T THINK IT'S WARRANTED
trainval/60OVlfAUPJg/50004 THIS IS JUST NUTS
trainval/60P7717SXOQ/50001 CA BENOIT MANDELBROT IS IN THE AUDIENCE
trainval/63tVsJI31Tk/50001 AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY HAVE DONE FOR ME
trainval/63XsokRPVSY/50001 DO THESE JEANS MAKE ME LOOK FAT
trainval/63XsokRPVSY/50002 DO I HAVE MUFFIN TOP
trainval/641aB1Dv1DY/50001 IT WILL BE COMPLETELY FREE AND IT WILL WORK IN ANY BROWSER
trainval/641aB1Dv1DY/50002 SO LET'S WATCH IT
trainval/641aB1Dv1DY/50003 WE'LL GO BACK AND I'LL SHOW YOU HOW WE MADE IT
trainval/641aB1Dv1DY/50004 IT ALSO MEANS THERE'S NO PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE
trainval/641aB1Dv1DY/50005 VIDEOS CREATED WITH POPCORN BEHAVE LIKE THE WEB ITSELF DYNAMIC FULL OF LINKS AND
trainval/64RLBgDSCck/50001 WHO EATS THAT
trainval/64RLBgDSCck/50003 BUT WHAT DO YOU WANT
trainval/65e2qScVSK8/50001 AND ONCE WE UNDERSTAND THEM WE WILL FINALLY UNDERSTAND OURSELVES
trainval/66Smr600NjU/50001 THEY FOUND THAT IN EVERY METROPOLITAN AREA THEY WOULD CAPTURE OVER 20 MINUTES A DAY OF CLEARTEXT
trainval/66Smr600NjU/50002 AND SO THEY HAD A SIMPLE SETUP
trainval/66Smr600NjU/50003 DON'T WASTE COMPUTER CYCLES
trainval/68c2M4r9oQg/50001 THAT WE ALL KNOW OF
trainval/694XUHVuGQo/50001 WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE A FUTURE TO OUR PAST IN ORDER TO HAVE A FUTURE
trainval/6a6vVIdQBd0/50001 ENOUGH TO GET STARTED TO GET GOING ENOUGH TO JOIN THAT SPEECH COMMUNITY AND BE PART OF IT
trainval/6a6vVIdQBd0/50002 WHEN WE FALL TO LEARN LANGUAGES
trainval/6a6vVIdQBd0/50003 HOW DO WE GET THAT FOOT IN THE DOOR
trainval/6a6vVIdQBd0/50004 AT LEAST THAT FOOT IN THE DOOR
trainval/6a6vVIdQBd0/50005 FIRST AND FOREMOST WHAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND IS OUR OWN PSYCHOLOGY
trainval/6a6vVIdQBd0/50006 WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S THE SOCIAL AND THE EMOTIONAL ASPECTS OF LANGUAGE LEARNING THAT DECIDE EVERYTHING
trainval/6a6vVIdQBd0/50007 ALL THE GRAMMAR
trainval/6a6vVIdQBd0/50008 ALL THE VOCABULARY
trainval/6a6vVIdQBd0/50009 THAT CAN TAKE A LOT OF THE PRESSURE OFF OF THE PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN TOLD YOU NEED TO ABANDON YOUR SMALL LANGUAGE IN FAVOR
trainval/6a6vVIdQBd0/50010 HOW I THINK
trainval/6Af5tJzSR2w/50001 OTHERS ARE AROUND FOR A LIFETIME
trainval/6Af5tJzSR2w/50002 WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE VIRUSES THAT ARE UP HERE AND THOSE VIRUSES THAT ARE LYING DEAD AND
trainval/6Af5tJzSR2w/50003 IT NEEDS OUR CELLS FOR BASIC METABOLIC PROCESSING
trainval/6Af5tJzSR2w/50004 FROM TRANSCRIPTION AND TRANSLATION TO PROTEIN FOLDING PROTEIN MODIFICATION INTRACELLULAR TRAFFICKING
trainval/6Af5tJzSR2w/50005 CASE IN POINT
trainval/6Af5tJzSR2w/50006 IT ENCODES ONLY EIGHTEEN PROTEINS AS OPPOSED TO OUR GENOME WHICH ENCODES OVER 23000
trainval/6Af5tJzSR2w/50007 AND YET THOSE EIGHTEEN SIMPLE PROTEINS ARE ENOUGH TO HIGHJACK EVERY SYSTEM WITHIN OUR CELL
trainval/6Af5tJzSR2w/50008 THESE SIMPLE EIGHTEEN PROTEINS NETWORK LIKE THIS IN EVERY SINGLE INFECTED CELL TO
trainval/6Af5tJzSR2w/50009 EVERY CUT ON YOUR ARM EVERY SCRAPE ON YOUR KNEE
trainval/6Af5tJzSR2w/50010 HOWEVER THAT'S NOT THE END OF THE STORY
trainval/6Af5tJzSR2w/50011 IT'S EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU HAVE TOO MUCH MUTATION
trainval/6Af5tJzSR2w/50012 IT ADAPTS OVER TIME TO BETTER AND BETTER FIND A VERY SPECIFIC THREAT
trainval/6Af5tJzSR2w/50013 HIV GETS AROUND THIS BY BEING HIGHLY DIVERSE
trainval/6Af5tJzSR2w/50014 AND SO CONTROLLING MUTATION IS THE KEY IN DETERMINING THE OUTCOME OF THE INFECTION
trainval/6Af5tJzSR2w/50015 TWO DIFFERENT ROUTES USING THE SAME PRINCIPLE OF ALTERING THE MUTATION RATE TO CONQUER A
trainval/6Af6bSwyiwI/50001 NO ONE TO LOOK AT THE DIAGNOSTICS
trainval/6Af6bSwyiwI/50002 AND THAT WAS JUST LUCK
trainval/6Af6bSwyiwI/50003 THE SOURCE OF THE VIRUS COULD BE A NATURAL EPIDEMIC LIKE EBOLA OR IT COULD BE BIOTERRORISM
trainval/6Af6bSwyiwI/50004 WE'VE GOT CELL PHONES TO GET INFORMATION FROM THE PUBLIC AND GET INFORMATION OUT TO THEM
trainval/6Af6bSwyiwI/50005 WE HAVE SATELLITE MAPS WHERE WE CAN SEE WHERE PEOPLE ARE AND WHERE THEY'RE MOVING
trainval/6Af6bSwyiwI/50006 SO THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY READY TO GO
trainval/6Af6bSwyiwI/50007 THE LAST TIME A GERM GAME WAS DONE IN THE UNITED STATES WAS BACK IN 2001 AND IT DIDN'T GO SO WELL
trainval/6Af6bSwyiwI/50008 IF WE START NOW WE CAN BE READY FOR THE NEXT EPIDEMIC
trainval/6aRz72yxHQo/50001 AND SITTING NEXT TO YOU ARE YOUR FRIENDS AND YOUR FAMILY
trainval/6aRz72yxHQo/50002 OUR TEACHERS OUR COACHES OUR PROFESSORS ALL SHOW US SOMETHING THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW BEFORE
trainval/6bCHq1OvGR4/50001 AND VISUAL SPATIAL PEOPLE ARE REALLY GREAT AT SEEING THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THINGS AND THE WHOLE
trainval/6bCHq1OvGR4/50002 ALREADY YOU CAN START TO SEE PATTERNS
trainval/6bCHq1OvGR4/50003 THEY LET ME SYNTHESIZE AND VISUALIZE MY LEARNING
trainval/6bVhrpkp0WU/50002 I THOUGHT ABOUT THE BROADWAY SHOWS I WENT TO AT THE EISENHOWER
trainval/6bVhrpkp0WU/50003 IT THOUGHT ABOUT ALL MY ARTIST FRIENDS
trainval/6bVhrpkp0WU/50004 THEY ALSO LIKED THE IDEA SO YURI AND I WENT TO DIFFERENT BUSINESS OWNERS AND DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY AND EVERYBODY THAT WE WENT
trainval/6bVhrpkp0WU/50006 THERE WERE SO MANY STORIES I WENT TO DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES AND DID LECTURES ABOUT COMMUNITIES AND I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO GO TO WILLIAMSPORT
trainval/6bVhrpkp0WU/50007 MY WHOLE LIFE I'VE BEEN PAINTING MURALS
trainval/6bVhrpkp0WU/50008 I WENT BACK TO MR
trainval/6bVhrpkp0WU/50009 SCHREYER A YEAR LATER AND I SAID MR
trainval/6bVhrpkp0WU/50010 SCHREYER YOU'RE GOING TO HATE THAT YOU TAUGHT ME THAT ONE THING
trainval/6bVhrpkp0WU/50011 80 FIREFIGHTERS BUFF THOSE CROSSES FOR AN HOUR A DAY FOR 80 DAYS STRAIGHT
trainval/6bVhrpkp0WU/50012 I GROUND THE METAL OFF THE BACK OF THE CROSSES AND WHEN WE PUT THE CROSSES UP WE PUT RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS
trainval/6bVhrpkp0WU/50013 MARSHALL WAS DYING AT THE TIME SO I TOOK THAT PAINTING INTO HIS DEATHBED AND HIS DAUGHTER WAS READING HIM THE LETTERS WHILE I WAS
trainval/6bVhrpkp0WU/50014 AND I FOUND OUT THAT THEIR STORIES WERE LIKE OURS AND THEY WERE LIKE OH WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A MURAL LIKE THIS IN OUR COUNTRY
trainval/6bVhrpkp0WU/50015 SO I STARTED TO THINK HOW WONDERFUL IT WOULD BE TO TAKE THE MURAL IN STATE COLLEGE STITCH IT ON THE INTERNET TO THE MURAL IN
trainval/6bVhrpkp0WU/50016 ANN OLIVET WAS GETTING READY TO GO TO NORWAY TO MEET WITH HER NEPHEW WHO IS A FAMOUS COMEDIAN JAN BACH ASSUMED SPELLING
trainval/6bVhrpkp0WU/50017 SHE SAID WHY DON'T YOU AND YURI COME WITH US
trainval/6bVhrpkp0WU/50018 SO WE TOOK THE MONEY THAT WE RAISED ON THAT PROJECT AND WE BOUGHT PLANE TICKETS
trainval/6bVhrpkp0WU/50019 WE FLEW TO NORWAY AND WE MET WITH HIM AND WE ALSO WERE AMAZED BY HOW PEOPLE JUST
trainval/6bVhrpkp0WU/50020 THEY WERE SENDING ME ARTICLES AND LETTERS
trainval/6bVhrpkp0WU/50021 MY FRIENDS WOULD SAY YOU KNOW THE GUY FROM GHOSTBUSTERS THE EVIL GUY HE WAS FROM MOLDOVA
trainval/6bVhrpkp0WU/50022 THEY WERE FROM MOLDOVA AND I WAS LIKE OH MY GOD WHERE AM I GOING
trainval/6bVhrpkp0WU/50023 WE GOT ON THE PLANE WE YOU KNOW WE WERE DIVERTED BECAUSE THERE WAS FOG OVER MOLDOVA TO ROMANIA
trainval/6bVhrpkp0WU/50024 SO I GOT ON FACEBOOK AND I FACEBOOKED OVER 300 STELLA ROTARUS
trainval/6bVhrpkp0WU/50025 IT WAS THE DAY BEFORE WE WERE LEAVING MOLDOVA AND SHE GOT A HOLD OF ME
trainval/6bVhrpkp0WU/50026 SHE TALKED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HER
trainval/6bVhrpkp0WU/50027 AFTER SHE SPOKE OUT A WOMAN WHO WAS 70 YEARS OLD CAME UP TO MY DAUGHTER AND SAID I WAS RAPED LIKE YOU WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE AND I
trainval/6bVhrpkp0WU/50028 LISTENING TO YOU I AM NOW GOING TO GET HELP
trainval/6c0VtOdibcI/50001 I LIKE A LOT OF BLACK COLORS A LOT OF GRAYS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
trainval/6Co3dn0nSTk/50001 THEY WERE SITTING OUTSIDE THEIR HOUSE WAITING FOR THEIR NEPHEW TO COME HOME WHO WAS JUST PLAYING BASKETBALL AT A
trainval/6Co3dn0nSTk/50002 I WANTED TO DEMAND TO PRAY TO BESEECH THEM TO STOP THEIR RAIDS AND ASK FOR THEM TO MEET WITH US LOCAL
trainval/6Co3dn0nSTk/50003 THE ICE EXECUTIVES WERE SITTING WAY ACROSS THE TABLE FROM US
trainval/6Co3dn0nSTk/50004 WE CREATED A STRUCTURE AND STRATEGY BY WHICH WE WOULD SUPPORT THE
trainval/6d6oq0zGGmw/50001 SO WHEN WE WERE SURE THAT THE MONKEY HAD REACHED HIS PLATEAU OF SPONTANEOUS RECOVERY
trainval/6E3zVSCSGYk/50001 THEY'VE GOT STUDIES IN TEAM DYNAMICS AND MORE LEADERSHIP WITH MORE TOOLS WITH WHICH WE CAN BUILD A STRONG AND
trainval/6E3zVSCSGYk/50002 WHEN WILL THIS PERSON START TO FUNCTION
trainval/6E3zVSCSGYk/50003 WHEN YOU SAY
trainval/6E3zVSCSGYk/50004 YET WE YOU LOOK INTO ORGANIZATIONS IN THE COMPANIES WHAT DO YOU FIND
trainval/6E3zVSCSGYk/50005 YOU FIND MANAGEMENT AGAINST EMPLOYEES GROUPS OF EMPLOYEES AGAINST OTHER GROUPS OF EMPLOYEES SALES AGAINST
trainval/6E3zVSCSGYk/50006 NOW THEY SIT AND WAIT FOR THE PHONE TO RING
trainval/6E3zVSCSGYk/50007 HOW DO YOU MAKE A FAMILY OUT OF ALL THESE DIFFERENT PEOPLES
trainval/6e99DuPQ6j8/50001 BUT LIFE HAS A WAY OF HAPPENING TO YOU SO WHEN I FINALLY WANTED TO GO AND STUDY I WAS ALREADY IN
trainval/6e99DuPQ6j8/50002 SO IN MY CASE BEING BLESSED BY HARDSHIPS MADE ME LOOK OUTSIDE
trainval/6e99DuPQ6j8/50003 AND SLOWLY I REALIZED THAT I WAS STARTING TO LIVE MY LIFE IN THAT WAY NOT JUST TO MAKE MY
trainval/6EghiYSs2ts/50001 THINK ABOUT IT
trainval/6EghiYSs2ts/50002 DEVELOPING AUD WAS AN INCREDIBLY CONFUSING THING FOR SOMEBODY WHO ADMITTEDLY LIKES TO BE IN
trainval/6EghiYSs2ts/50003 I WAS A VERY LIGHT DRINKER IN MY 20S
trainval/6EghiYSs2ts/50005 I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM THE OUTSIDE I HAD A GREAT LIFE
trainval/6EghiYSs2ts/50006 I'M NOT AN ADDICT
trainval/6EghiYSs2ts/50007 DAY 5 I WAS IN A FULL BLOWN BINGE I WAS DRINKING ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING I
trainval/6EghiYSs2ts/50008 WENT COLD TURKEY AND TRIED TO DETOX
trainval/6EghiYSs2ts/50009 THE OPIATE BLOCKER STOPS THOSE ENDORPHINS FROM EVEN LEAVING THE ROOM
trainval/6EghiYSs2ts/50010 I ALSO ASKED HIM TO THANK AMERICAN RESEARCHER DR
trainval/6EghiYSs2ts/50011 HE SAID WELL WHY DON'T YOU WRITE A BOOK
trainval/6EghiYSs2ts/50012 KEITH HUMPHREYS FROM STANFORD UNIVERSITY SAID IT'S REMARKABLE THAT PEOPLE BELIEVE WHAT'S NEEDED IS MORE
trainval/6EghiYSs2ts/50013 IF WE ADDICTS HAD A NORMAL DISEASE WE WOULD BE TREATED WITH SYMPATHY AND COMFORT INSTEAD WE'RE
trainval/6EghiYSs2ts/50014 WHAT IF IT'S A WORSE RELAPSE THAN THE LAST ONE
trainval/6ePXxeGrfvQ/50001 BY THE WAY WE'RE NOT PATHOLOGIZING PEOPLE TO WHOM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS
trainval/6Eu964BbJO4/50001 SEVEN YEARS AGO I WAS THE PROUD YOUNG FATHER OF A SON GIJS AGED THREE AND A DAUGHTER LARA AGED
trainval/6Eu964BbJO4/50002 THEY WERE HAVING FUN AND THEREFORE CONTINUED
trainval/6Eu964BbJO4/50003 FIVE YEARS SINCE LAUNCHED HUNDRED OF THOUSANDS OF KIDS HAVE ACCESSED TO SQULA
trainval/6Eu964BbJO4/50004 AND MORE THAN 500 MILLION EXTRA MINUTES OF TIME AFTER SCHOOL HAS BEEN SPENT LEARNING
trainval/6Eu964BbJO4/50005 WHAT'S THAT LAW
trainval/6Eu964BbJO4/50006 WHAT MAKES THEM TICK
trainval/6Eu964BbJO4/50007 WHAT ARE THEIR FAVORITE GAMES
trainval/6Eu964BbJO4/50008 WE CONSULT GROUPS OF KIDS IN OUR OFFICE EVERY WEEK THAT TELL US HOW THEY WANT TO LEARN
trainval/6Eu964BbJO4/50009 HAVE FUN CHANGING EDUCATION
trainval/6fJRmouSDL4/50001 THE ALPHABET SOUP OF L G B T Q Q I A HAS
trainval/6fJRmouSDL4/50002 WE ARE I CAN HAPPILY TELL YOU THE ONLY PEER LED LGBT YOUTH ORGANIZATION OF ITS KIND IN THE COUNTRY
trainval/6fJRmouSDL4/50003 OUR FIRST EVENT I CAN RECALL OLD PHOTOS OF OUR FIRST SOCIAL EVENT BACK IN JUNE 2010 IT WAS A POOL PARTY
trainval/6fJRmouSDL4/50004 TWELVE YOUNG GAY AND LESBIAN KIDS CAME TOGETHER FOR A DAY OF SUMMERTIME FUN
trainval/6fJRmouSDL4/50005 THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECRECY IN OUR GROUP ENSURES THAT THOSE SAFE AND OPEN SPACES ARE
trainval/6fJRmouSDL4/50006 STARTING HUMBLY FROM THAT LOVELY QUEER POOL PARTY FIVE YEARS AGO WE'VE EXPANDED TO REGULAR EVENTS
trainval/6fJRmouSDL4/50007 WE ALSO PROVIDE THOSE MEANINGFUL LINKS AND CONNECTIONS TO COMMUNITY RESOURCES AND
trainval/6fJRmouSDL4/50008 MORE CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WE MIGHT THINK OF THE SPRAWLING SUBURBIA WHERE THOUSANDS OF HOUSES
trainval/6fJRmouSDL4/50009 WE HAVE GROWN FROM THAT FIRST SMALL GAY POOL PARTY OF TWELVE AND
trainval/6fJRmouSDL4/50010 THE QNYN IS DIVIDED INTO THREE SUBGROUPS
trainval/6fJRmouSDL4/50012 NOT ONLY ARE WE ABLE TO USE THE INTERNET AS A MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE IT IS A FACILITATOR A
trainval/6fJRmouSDL4/50013 IT IS A LINK IT IS BRINGING TOGETHER THOSE MANY ISLANDS
trainval/6fJRmouSDL4/50014 LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
trainval/6g3WUEgrvVA/50001 SO IN MAGIC WE CALL THIS THE HAM SANDWICH
trainval/6g3WUEgrvVA/50002 AND THE HAM SANDWICH IS BEST EXPLAINED AS AS A STORY OR AN EXAMPLE
trainval/6g3WUEgrvVA/50003 IMAGINE YOU PULLED OUT THIS SANDWICH
trainval/6g3WUEgrvVA/50004 WHY DO YOU FORGET
trainval/6g3WUEgrvVA/50005 BECAUSE SO WHAT
trainval/6g3WUEgrvVA/50006 YOU DID THIS TRICK
trainval/6g3WUEgrvVA/50007 IT COULD BE THE MOST AMAZING THING EVER
trainval/6g3WUEgrvVA/50008 I'M GOING TO CHANGE THE SITUATION A LITTLE BIT
trainval/6g3WUEgrvVA/50009 IMAGINE YOU'RE WALKING DOWN THE STREET WITH YOUR FRIEND
trainval/6g3WUEgrvVA/50012 I SNAP MY FINGERS AND YOU REACH INSIDE YOUR POCKET
trainval/6g3WUEgrvVA/50013 YOU GO HOME AND PUT IT ON INSTAGRAM TWITTER FACEBOOK
trainval/6g3WUEgrvVA/50014 I GAVE YOU SOMETHING YOU NEEDED THAT YOU WANTED THAT YOU DIDN'T REALLY EVEN THINK WAS POSSIBLE
trainval/6g3WUEgrvVA/50015 AND THAT'S WHAT WE TRY TO DO WITH MAGIC
trainval/6gSwRHScq6M/50002 AND HE EXPLAINED TO ME HOW IN 2003 AND 2004 HE WOULD GO ON SPREES IN NEW
trainval/6gSwRHScq6M/50003 AT HIS OPEN PRISON HE CAME UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FINANCIAL FRAUDSTERS AND THOSE FINANCIAL
trainval/6gSwRHScq6M/50004 ONE OF THE SMARTEST PEOPLE I'VE EVER MET
trainval/6gSwRHScq6M/50005 MG I THINK TO AN EXTENT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S AXIOMATIC AMONG HACKERS THAT THEY DO
trainval/6gSwRHScq6M/50006 AND LET ME BE BLUNT ABOUT THIS
trainval/6H6wKMYSiEU/50001 I REMEMBER MY MOM PUT ME IN SUMMER CAMP AND I CAME HOME FROM SUMMER CAMP I GOT IN THE
trainval/6H6wKMYSiEU/50002 SHE SAID THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT BOYS AND KISSING AND MUCH LIKE WHAT HAPPENED IN SOUTH CENTRAL MOMS OH
trainval/6H6wKMYSiEU/50003 SHE MOVED US TO WESTCHESTER CALIFORNIA WHICH IS ONLY THREE MILES AWAY
trainval/6H6wKMYSiEU/50004 THEY WALKED IN AND THEY SAW A BULLET HOLE HAD GONE THROUGH THE CHALKBOARD THE
trainval/6H6wKMYSiEU/50005 I SOUGHT TO CHANGE THE WAY WOMEN VIEWED THEMSELVES AND THEIR HAIR
trainval/6H6wKMYSiEU/50006 I AM SURE MANY OTHERS
trainval/6ibCtsHgz3Y/50001 SO I WAS DETERMINED TO FIND ANOTHER CALLING
trainval/6ibCtsHgz3Y/50002 NOBODY AROUND TO TEACH ME
trainval/6ibCtsHgz3Y/50003 IT'S A STANDARD PRACTICE IN THE ACADEMIC WORLD
trainval/6ibCtsHgz3Y/50004 IT IS NOT IMPORTANT IF I LIKE THE JOB OR NOT
trainval/6ibCtsHgz3Y/50005 ITS MOST IMPORTANT PURPOSE IS TO GET US IN TOUCH WITH WHERE DREAMS COME FROM
trainval/6ibCtsHgz3Y/50006 EVEN A SHATTERED DREAM CAN DO THAT FOR YOU
trainval/6iFCm5ZokBI/50001 I'VE BEEN SKINNY MY ENTIRE LIFE I WAS BORN 8
trainval/6iFCm5ZokBI/50002 I WAS A PROJECT MANAGER I GOT TO NAME MY PROJECTS WHATEVER I WANTED
trainval/6iFCm5ZokBI/50003 SO INSTEAD OF THE STANDARD RETAIL SALES 2
trainval/6iFCm5ZokBI/50004 BUT 81 OF EMPLOYEES SAY THAT A FUN WORKPLACE WOULD MAKE THEM MORE PRODUCTIVE AND 98 OF CEOS PREFER
trainval/6iFCm5ZokBI/50005 HUMOR IS DEFINED AS COMIC ABSURD OR INCONGRUOUS QUALITY CAUSING AMUSEMENT
trainval/6iFCm5ZokBI/50006 IT'S NOT ABOUT MAKING WORK FUNNY BUT MAKING WORK FUN
trainval/6iFCm5ZokBI/50007 YOU CHOOSE IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THE THINGS THAT WILL GET YOU PAID MORE
trainval/6JcKbNSGjCE/50001 SO WHY DO WE DO THIS PROJECT
trainval/6JcKbNSGjCE/50002 I DIDN'T ASK HIM IF HE GOT SEASICK HIS DAUGHTER GETS SEASICK AND I JUST WONDERED IF HE DID
trainval/6JcKbNSGjCE/50003 WE TAKE A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH TO LIFE AND EVERYTHING THAT WE DO
trainval/6JcKbNSGjCE/50004 YOUR FAMILY HAS STORIES
trainval/6JcKbNSGjCE/50005 YOU COME FROM A TRIBE SOMEWHERE YOU COME FROM A PEOPLE SOMEWHERE
trainval/6JcKbNSGjCE/50006 AND AS I LOOK OUT TO THE AUDIENCE AND I'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT WITH MANY OF YOU TODAY THERE ARE SO MANY RACES
trainval/6JM9JD2iYrk/50001 WE NEED MORE OBSERVATIONS TO UNDERSTAND THESE PROCESSES MORE
trainval/6JxRxBqQLKA/50001 THE ONLY THING WORSE IS ABSOLUTE TYRANNY WHERE YOU ARE RULED BY A DESPOT
trainval/6JxRxBqQLKA/50002 HOW MANY OF YOU SAID THAT
trainval/6k8YBJ5sgko/50001 I THINK THIS WENT STRAIGHT TO GOD'S VOICEMAIL THOUGH
trainval/6k8YBJ5sgko/50002 NO I WAS NOT GOING TO MAGICALLY CHANGE
trainval/6k8YBJ5sgko/50003 AND OVER TIME I GREW LESS AND LESS SURE THAT I ACTUALLY WANTED TO
trainval/6k8YBJ5sgko/50004 NOW WHEN MOST OF US DECIDE TO WEAR A PAIR OF JEANS SOMEPLACE LIKE NEW YORK LONDON MILAN
trainval/6k8YBJ5sgko/50005 MY GRANDMOTHER WAS A WOMAN WHO TOOK EXTRAORDINARY PLEASURE IN DRESSING UP
trainval/6k8YBJ5sgko/50006 IN INDIA ACCORDING TO CUSTOM WHEN A HINDU WOMAN BECOMES A WIDOW ALL SHE'S ALLOWED TO WEAR IS
trainval/6k8YBJ5sgko/50007 IT HAS THE POWER TO FILL US WITH JOY THE JOY OF FREEDOM TO CHOOSE FOR OURSELVES
trainval/6k8YBJ5sgko/50008 WIDOWS IN INDIA LIKE MY GRANDMOTHER THOUSANDS OF THEM LIVE IN A CITY CALLED VRINDAVAN
trainval/6k8YBJ5sgko/50009 HOWEVER ONLY AS RECENTLY AS 2013 THE WIDOWS OF VRINDAVAN HAVE STARTED TO
trainval/6k8YBJ5sgko/50010 HOWEVER HE SOON STARTED RECEIVING DEATH THREATS FOR HOW HE LOOKED
trainval/6k8YBJ5sgko/50011 TWO THOUSAND MILES AWAY IN PESHAWAR PAKISTANI TRANSGENDER ACTIVIST ALISHA WAS SHOT
trainval/6k8YBJ5sgko/50012 HOWEVER IF I TODAY THEN YOU TOMORROW MAYBE EVEN MORE OF US SOMEDAY IF WE
trainval/6k8YBJ5sgko/50013 AND THIS WE CAN SAY WITHOUT A SINGLE WORD
trainval/6k8YBJ5sgko/50014 FASHION CAN GIVE US A LANGUAGE FOR DISSENT
trainval/6kuCSIemiCs/50001 AND SO I WAS WORKING WITH
trainval/6lFvXTxgokY/50001 THEY WERE LONELY AND OVERWHELMED BY WORK
trainval/6lFvXTxgokY/50002 MAYBE THIS IS BECAUSE THE TANGO EMBRACE IS AN EXPRESSION OF THE ARGENTINE CULTURE HISTORY AND
trainval/6liIKYeUzaY/50001 WE OFTEN RELATE SILENCES WITH
trainval/6LmPq7DSds0/50001 INCREASED CONTROL MECHANISMS WON'T SOLVE THAT PROBLEM
trainval/6LpSNMaU0r8/50001 THE DAY AFTER WHEN REALLY IT BECAME A LOT OF TALKING I SAID TO MYSELF AND MY WIFE SAID TO ME
trainval/6LpSNMaU0r8/50002 AT SOME POINT HE JUST SAID 40 MILLION PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SEE YOU TODAY
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50001 I WAS SO AWKWARD AND AFRAID OF SELLING
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50002 BECAUSE IT PLANTED AN ENTREPRENEURIAL SEED I DIDN T KNOW WAS THERE
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50003 AND THAT BEARS FRUIT TO THIS DAY
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50004 BOOKS COACHING WEBINARS WHATEVER
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50005 AND THEIR HEARTS IN THE RIGHT PLACE IT S GREAT I M ALL ABOUT SELF DISCOVERY
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50006 BUT WHEN YOU ASK SOMEONE OR YOU RE ASKED LIKE WHAT S YOUR PASSION
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50008 IT S LIKE OH MY GOD I HAVE TO CAME OUT WITH A GOOD ANSWER FOR THIS
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50009 ONE OF MY FRIENDS IN HER MID FORTIES AND SHE S LOOKING WHAT S HER LIFE GOING TO BE NOW
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50010 AND SHE S LEGITIMATELY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50011 SHE S READY TO HIRE A TEAM OF PEOPLE
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50012 I MEAN I LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50013 IF YOU RE NOT PAID TO DO SOMETHING YOU RE NOT GOING TO BE THERE VERY LONG
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50014 BUT THIS IDEA THAT I HAD TO KNOW WHAT I SUPPOSE TO DO NOW RIGHT
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50015 I M SUPPOSED TO PURSUE THIS PASSION
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50016 IT S JUST BUGGED ME
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50017 IT ALWAYS HAD
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50018 AND IF YOU DO THAT EVERYTHING WILL FALL INTO PLACE AND IF YOU DON T YOU FAILED
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50019 THE PRESSURE STARTS REALLY YOUNG AND IT GOES YOUR WHOLE LIFE BUT IT S PERHAPS MOST PRONOUNCED WHEN YOU RE
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50020 I LOVED THE JOB I REALLY DID
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50021 THE WOMAN WHO SOLD ME THIS DRESS
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50022 I TOLD HER WHAT I NEEDED THE DRESS FOR WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT AND SHE SAID OH MY GOSH I REALLY NEED TO HEAR THIS TALK BECAUSE I JUST
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50023 MY MOTHER BEGGED ME SHE SAID PLEASE TAKE A JOB ANY JOB
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50024 AT THE TIME I VE BEEN ALSO HOSTING A RADIO SHOW FOR THE MARTHA STEWART BRAND ON SIRIUS XM
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50025 EXCEPT I KNEW I HAD A REASON TO GET UP IN THE MORNING GET SHOWERED LEAVE THE HOUSE PEOPLE WHO WERE WAITING FOR ME WHEN I GOT
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50026 AND THEN NOT LONG AFTER THAT GOT CANCELLED TOO
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50027 ONE OF MY FAVOURITE COLUMNS IS A PIECE BY DILBERT CREATOR SCOTT ADAMS
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50028 HE WROTE A PIECE IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL A FEW YEARS AGO ABOUT HOW WE FAILED HIS WAY TO SUCCESS
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50029 AND ONE OF HIS JOBS WAS A COMMERCIAL LOAN OFFICER
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50030 AND HE WAS TAUGHT SPECIFICALLY
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50031 ON THE DAY OF MY LAST SHOW I GOT ONTO THE ELEVATOR AT THE 36TH FLOOR AND AS IT STARTED TO DROP I
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50032 SHE SAID IT S LIKE TUPPERWARE BUT WITH BRACELETS
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50033 AND I HAD NO PASSION FOR JEWELRY
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50034 I MEAN HONESTLY MY EARRINGS COST 20
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50035 YES I COULD DO THAT
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50036 AND THAT YOUR LIFE ISN T WORTH LIVING
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50037 AND IT S NOT TRUE
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50038 IT IS THE FULL FORCE OF YOUR ATTENTION AND ENERGY THAT YOU GIVE TO WHATEVER IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50039 YOU KNOW WHY
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50040 BECAUSE THE MOST FULFILLING RELATIONSHIPS THE MOST FULFILLING CAREERS ARE THOSE THAT STILL HAVE THE POWER TO
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50041 AND AS FOR THE THINGS YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO DO
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50042 LOOK FOR PROBLEMS THAT NEED SOLVING
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50043 THAT WHEN SOMEONE ASKS YOU AT A PARTY ON A DATE AT A JOB INTERVIEW WHAT ARE YOU
trainval/6MBaFL7sCb8/50044 THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THIS WOW COMPELLING ANSWER
trainval/6MgDcFlTgVM/50001 I LOOK AT THE CHEMISTRY OF THE OCEAN IN THE PAST
trainval/6O9BKRJDqNA/50001 WE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO THINK ABOUT THE WAYS WE TALK ABOUT GENDER
trainval/6oLsJUH1cfU/50001 WE USED LANDMARKS TO APPROXIMATE THEIR PHYSICAL ADDRESSES
trainval/6ORDQFh0Byw/50001 CALL IT IMPOSSIBLY IDEALISTIC IF YOU MUST
trainval/6qqqVwM6bMM/50001 THERE ARE NO CONTRACTS NO WRITTEN CONTRACTS
trainval/6qqqVwM6bMM/50002 YOU CAN STAY WITH ME FOR 20 YEARS GO TOMORROW
trainval/6qqqVwM6bMM/50003 THIS IS WHAT WE TEACH IN THE NIGHT SCHOOLS
trainval/6qqqVwM6bMM/50004 YOU DON'T CHOOSE THE SPOKEN WORD
trainval/6qqqVwM6bMM/50005 I SAID I CAN'T MR
trainval/6qqqVwM6bMM/50007 SHE DOESN'T KNOW THE LANGUAGE
trainval/6qqqVwM6bMM/50008 YOU DON'T KNOW HER
trainval/6qqqVwM6bMM/50009 I SAID I LIKE THE BODY LANGUAGE
trainval/6qqqVwM6bMM/50010 I LIKE THE WAY SHE SPEAKS
trainval/6qqqVwM6bMM/50011 THEY'RE ALL OVER THE WORLD
trainval/6qTfX4U6CS0/50001 I MEAN IT'S THE SAME STORY
trainval/6qTfX4U6CS0/50002 IT'S JUST DIFFERENT NAMES
trainval/6qTfX4U6CS0/50004 I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED
trainval/6qTfX4U6CS0/50005 WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT
trainval/6qTfX4U6CS0/50006 OKAY SO THAT'S NUMBER ONE
trainval/6qTfX4U6CS0/50007 NUMBER TWO WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY IS MOVE TOWARD YOUNG BLACK MEN INSTEAD OF AWAY FROM THEM
trainval/6qTfX4U6CS0/50008 WE WERE OUTSIDE IT WAS LATE AT NIGHT AND WE WERE WONDERING WHERE WE WERE GOING WE WERE LOST
trainval/6qTfX4U6CS0/50009 WE REALLY NEED TO RELAX ABOUT THIS
trainval/6qTfX4U6CS0/50010 LIKE I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO WORK FOR ME
trainval/6qTfX4U6CS0/50011 I MEAN YOU JUST HAVE TO DO IT
trainval/6qTfX4U6CS0/50012 AND WE WONDER WHY THESE BIASES DON'T DIE AND MOVE FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION
trainval/6rcvWcRMuzs/50002 IN MY DEFENSE THOUGH WHEN ANDERSON DISCOVERED POSITRONS HE WAS NOT THINKING ABOUT PET SCANS
trainval/6rcvWcRMuzs/50003 I DON'T KNOW
trainval/6SdtkXAQq3k/50001 AT FIRST HE WAS VERY INTERESTED
trainval/6SdtkXAQq3k/50002 I DON T BLAME THEM
trainval/6SdtkXAQq3k/50003 NOR DO I BLAME THE DEAN FOR HIS INITIAL SKEPTICISM
trainval/6SdtkXAQq3k/50004 IT IS TIME FOR US TO REMOVE THE BARRIERS THAT PERMANENTLY RELEGATE INDIVIDUALS WITH CRIMINAL
trainval/6SdtkXAQq3k/50005 I NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN ANY TYPE OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR AN UNTREATED
trainval/6SdtkXAQq3k/50006 STAND UP FOR YOURSELF
trainval/6StqiaPoS2U/50001 DAVIS AND FIGURED OUT HOW TO RAISE BEES IN FRONT OF A CAMERA
trainval/6tpsSu5O0Ws/50001 IT WAS ACTUALLY ASA CARTER WHO WROTE THOSE INFAMOUS WORDS THAT WALLACE SAID ON THE STEPS OF THE ALABAMA
trainval/6tpsSu5O0Ws/50002 NOW I FIRST LEARNED ABOUT THIS STORY THE WAY I LEARNED ABOUT LOTS OF GOOD STORIES I KNOW FROM THE RADIO SHOW THIS AMERICAN
trainval/6tpsSu5O0Ws/50003 WE SEE THE SAME RESULT IN POLICE DATA
trainval/6tpsSu5O0Ws/50004 WHAT THEY FIND IS THAT ON THE WAY INTO THE PARK PEOPLE STOP TO PICK UP THAT GLOVE ABOUT 62 PERCENT
trainval/6tpsSu5O0Ws/50005 BUT IF WE COLLECTIVELY CATCH TOO MANY FISH THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO SPAWN THERE'LL BE NO FISH AVAILABLE TO CATCH
trainval/6tpsSu5O0Ws/50006 ANOTHER WAY TO OUT THIS
trainval/6tpsSu5O0Ws/50007 FOR US TO TACKLE THESE PROBLEMS WE NEED BROAD BUY IN WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER WE NEED TO WORK COLLECTIVELY AND
trainval/6tpsSu5O0Ws/50008 GIVEN OUR DISCONNECTION FROM NATURE I THINK THAT THIS MIGHT BE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE UNDERESTIMATING THAT COULD
trainval/6tpsSu5O0Ws/50009 WHEN THEY ACTUALLY WENT ON THE WALK THEY FELT A LOT BETTER IF THEY WERE IN NATURE COMPARED TO INDOORS
trainval/6tSlMoMNSlY/50001 AND SO INSTEAD OF READING YOU CAN PRODUCE THINGS
trainval/6tSlMoMNSlY/50002 AND IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN A REALLY SUCCESSFULL WAY OF INTRODUCING THE MEANS OF
trainval/6ul2TSvUDog/50001 WELL THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS
trainval/6ul2TSvUDog/50002 AND LET ME GO BACK TO THAT IMAGE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN
trainval/6ul2TSvUDog/50003 THE LAST ONE'S A PERSONAL QUESTION
trainval/6ul2TSvUDog/50004 IT WOULD BE JUST TOO DEPRESSING
trainval/6V6p1tgHfm0/50001 THEY DON'T WANT TO DATE ONE ANOTHER
trainval/6V6p1tgHfm0/50002 WELL THESE WERE EXACTLY THE QUESTIONS THAT I AND MY COLLEAGUE MATT FEINBERG BECAME FASCINATED WITH A FEW YEARS AGO
trainval/6V6p1tgHfm0/50003 59 PERCENT OF THEM MADE ARGUMENTS IN TERMS OF ONE OF THE MORE CONSERVATIVE MORAL VALUES AND JUST EIGHT PERCENT
trainval/6V6p1tgHfm0/50004 THEY DON'T WANT TO BEFRIEND ONE ANOTHER
trainval/6V6p1tgHfm0/50005 AND REMEMBER THAT IN THESE MOVIES IT'S USUALLY WORST IN THE SECOND ACT WHEN OUR LEADS ARE
trainval/6vLrreR6YOE/50001 HOW CAN I SPEAK ABOUT CITIZENS' VIEWS OF THE FUTURE
trainval/6vLrreR6YOE/50002 I THOUGHT I'LL GO AROUND THE COUNTRY AND ASK PEOPLE WHAT THEIR VIEWS ARE
trainval/6vLrreR6YOE/50003 I'D SOLD MY CAR BECAUSE I NEEDED THE MONEY
trainval/6vLrreR6YOE/50004 THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION SAYS THAT DEPRESSION IS FAST BECOMING ONE OF THE BIGGEST PUBLIC
trainval/6vLrreR6YOE/50005 BUT I'M SURE HE COULD SEE THAT I WAS A WRECK
trainval/6vLrreR6YOE/50006 I FELT LIKE I WAS BECOMING A FRAUD
trainval/6vLrreR6YOE/50007 HIGGINS CALLED TO APPOINT ME TO THE COUNCIL OF STATE
trainval/6vLrreR6YOE/50008 PEOPLE OPENED UP TO ME
trainval/6vLrreR6YOE/50009 MOSTLY PEOPLE WERE FIGHTING FOR HOPE DETERMINED NEVER TO GIVE UP PEOPLE LIKE JANE IN WEXFORD WHO
trainval/6vLrreR6YOE/50010 EVERYWHERE I WENT I POSTED SOCIAL MEDIA UPDATES
trainval/6vLrreR6YOE/50011 PEOPLE STARTED FOLLOWING IT
trainval/6vLrreR6YOE/50012 PEOPLE STARTED TO GIVE ME MONEY DONATING ONLINE AND HANDING IT TO ME AS I WENT WHICH WAS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE I
trainval/6vLrreR6YOE/50013 I BECAME FREE
trainval/6vLrreR6YOE/50014 I REMEMBERED WHO I WAS AND WHAT IT WAS ABOUT
trainval/6vLrreR6YOE/50015 PARTS OF ME CAME TOGETHER AGAIN
trainval/6vLrreR6YOE/50017 AND YOU DON'T NEED TO GO HITCHHIKING
trainval/6vLrreR6YOE/50018 YOUR VOICE MATTERS
trainval/6vLrreR6YOE/50019 NOW PEOPLE WILL SAY I'M A DREAMER
trainval/6VnKV1sr5VQ/50001 OH YOU WANT ME TO PLAY THIS
trainval/6VWPHKABRQA/50001 OUR GUIDES WRITE ALL OF THEIR OWN ROUTES
trainval/6VWPHKABRQA/50002 I WOULD ASK MY FRIENDS I WOULD SAY THINK ABOUT THIS
trainval/6VWPHKABRQA/50003 SO THOSE WERE MY MUSEUM TOURS
trainval/6VWPHKABRQA/50004 MY FRIENDS TOLD THEIR FRIENDS AND THEIR FRIENDS TOLD THEIR FRIENDS
trainval/6VWPHKABRQA/50005 WE HIRE PEOPLE FROM A DIVERSE SET OF BACKGROUNDS
trainval/6VWPHKABRQA/50006 SO THEY GET DRAGGED THERE ON A DATE OR SOMETHING
trainval/6VWPHKABRQA/50007 WHEN THEY COME WE WELCOME THEM TO THE MUSEUM
trainval/6VWPHKABRQA/50008 BY THE WAY HE WAS PAINTING CHRIST LIKE THIS TO SIGNIFY THE MAN CHILD THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO
trainval/6VWPHKABRQA/50009 I'VE BEEN TO THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM NOW MORE THAN 300 TIMES IN THE LAST THREE YEARS
trainval/6VWPHKABRQA/50010 WE DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHO IT IS
trainval/6VWPHKABRQA/50011 THERE IS A LOT OF MYSTERY
trainval/6VWPHKABRQA/50012 THERE ARE TWO THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT YELLOW JASPER
trainval/6VWPHKABRQA/50013 THIS IS A VERY HARD STONE
trainval/6VWPHKABRQA/50014 I NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE
trainval/6VWPHKABRQA/50015 MY NAME IS NICK GRAY
trainval/6VWPHKABRQA/50016 THE NAME OF MY COMPANY IS MUSEUM HACK
trainval/6weGCM3sWKc/50001 THE FLOWERS ARE NAMED AFTER HIM THE MOUNTAINS ARE CARVED WITH HIS SLOGANS
trainval/6weGCM3sWKc/50002 I LIVE IN AMERICA THEIR OTHER ENEMY
trainval/6weGCM3sWKc/50003 BUT THAT TURNED OUT TO BE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE
trainval/6wk4dkYSrV0/50001 IN A IN OUR ARSENAL AND THE YOUTH AND SELECTIVELY BASED ON THE GOALS AT THE WORKSHOP BY THE FEES ARE THE WORKSHOP
trainval/6XNrzmh0EVs/50001 AND WHAT YOU'RE CALLED TO DO IS TO DO EVERYTHING IN YOUR POWER TO EMPOWER A BILLION
trainval/6XNrzmh0EVs/50002 SO I KNEW THAT EVERYTHING THAT I WAS DOING THEN FROM THAT POINT FORWARD AND THAT WAS JUST A YEAR AGO MY
trainval/6XNrzmh0EVs/50003 AND THEY SAID YOUR DAUGHTER IS NOT ONLY LEARNING DISABLED BUT WE BELIEVE SHE'S RETARDED
trainval/6XNrzmh0EVs/50004 WE CAN'T AFFORD IT
trainval/6XNrzmh0EVs/50005 SO I HAD MY OWN SPECIAL PARKING SPOT
trainval/6XNrzmh0EVs/50006 AND IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLE
trainval/6XNrzmh0EVs/50008 SO I WENT TO DR K AND I SAID HEY I'M JUST OUT OF SCHOOL I WANT TO BUILD A BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY
trainval/6XNrzmh0EVs/50009 GO BACK TRY IT AGAIN
trainval/6XNrzmh0EVs/50010 THE PLANE LANDED CALLED DR K I SAID I FIGURED IT OUT
trainval/6XNrzmh0EVs/50011 HE CAME BACK THE NEXT DAY GAVE US 250000 AND THAT REALLY KICKED OFF THAT FIRST COMPANY FOR ME AND IT ALSO EARNED ME
trainval/6XNrzmh0EVs/50012 WHAT I REALIZED IN THAT PROCESS THOUGH WAS THE SECOND POINT WHICH IS WE HAVE TO GET REALLY
trainval/6XNrzmh0EVs/50013 MY CNBC SHOW
trainval/6XNrzmh0EVs/50014 I AM NOT A TRAINED TELEVISION PERSONALITY
trainval/6XNrzmh0EVs/50015 I HAD NO IDEA HOW I WAS GOING TO DO THAT
trainval/6XNrzmh0EVs/50016 AND THAT TIMEPIECE KEEP IT IN MIND WHETHER IT'S 9 MONTHS OR SOME OTHER TIME FOR YOU THAT'S CRITICAL TOO
trainval/6XNrzmh0EVs/50017 AND THE REASON THAT IS CRITICAL IS BECAUSE IF THINGS I BELIEVE IN THE LAW OF ATTRACTION BUT IF THINGS HAPPENED
trainval/6XNrzmh0EVs/50018 WE NEED YOU
trainval/6XS8TA4RBog/50001 WE'LL GROW BY SIX CITIES OF 12 MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR FOR THE NEXT 30 YEARS
trainval/6XS8TA4RBog/50002 ALMOST ALL OF THAT GROWTH WILL BE IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD
trainval/6XS8TA4RBog/50003 HE EMPLOYED 200 PEOPLE
trainval/6XS8TA4RBog/50004 HE WAS GOING TO BE DEAD BY THE AGE OF 25
trainval/6XS8TA4RBog/50005 NOW THEY'RE NOT MARRIED AND THEY WANT TO GO ON TO STUDY FURTHER TO HAVE A CAREER
trainval/6XS8TA4RBog/50006 WHAT DO THEY LOOK LIKE
trainval/6XS8TA4RBog/50007 MOST OF OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM IS PUSH
trainval/6XS8TA4RBog/50008 THAT'S TOO LONG IF YOU'RE POOR
trainval/6XS8TA4RBog/50009 WELL YOU CREATE YOUR OWN TEACHERS
trainval/6XS8TA4RBog/50010 IT'S THE LARGEST NGO IN EDUCATION IN THE WORLD
trainval/6XS8TA4RBog/50011 AND THERE WILL BE NO MISTAKES
trainval/6XS8TA4RBog/50012 EVERY CHILD UP TO THE AGE OF 15 WHO WANTS A PLACE IN SCHOOL WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE ONE IN 2015
trainval/6XS8TA4RBog/50014 IT WILL BRING SKILLS AND LEARNING AND READING
trainval/6XS8TA4RBog/50015 BUT IT WILL ALSO LAY WASTE TO IMAGINATION
trainval/6XS8TA4RBog/50017 IT WILL LAY WASTE TO SOCIAL CONFIDENCE
trainval/6XS8TA4RBog/50018 IT WILL STRATIFY SOCIETY AS MUCH AS IT LIBERATES IT
trainval/6XS8TA4RBog/50019 AND WE ARE BEQUEATHING TO THE DEVELOPING WORLD SCHOOL SYSTEMS THAT THEY WILL NOW SPEND A CENTURY
trainval/6XS8TA4RBog/50020 THERE IS AN AMAZING SCHOOL IN NORTHEN QUEENSLAND CALLED JARINGAN
trainval/6xsvGYIxJok/50001 I AM LEARNING NEW YORK I HAVE LIVED HERE FOR OVER A DECADE SO I FOCUS ON NEW YORK
trainval/6xsvGYIxJok/50002 I NOTICE A FEW THINGS
trainval/6xsvGYIxJok/50004 SO TODAY I AM GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT MY JOURNEY OVER THE LAST YEAR WHERE I HAVE ACCIDENTALLY BECAME A
trainval/6xsvGYIxJok/50005 I DID IMPROV SINCE I WAS ABOUT 13 I'VE BEEN DOING IT EVER SINCE
trainval/6xsvGYIxJok/50006 I TRIED TO WRITE ABOUT THINGS THAT NEW YORKERS EXPERIENCE AND I FIGURED WHAT DO NEW YORKERS EXPERIENCE MORE THAN DUANE
trainval/6xsvGYIxJok/50007 WHAT IF WE TAKE ONE IDEA AND THAT IDEA IS GENDER
trainval/6xsvGYIxJok/50008 THEY'RE NOT DROPPING YOU OFF ON THE CORNER AND SAYING GOOD LUCK BUDDY
trainval/6xsvGYIxJok/50009 HOW MUCH WOULD THAT BE
trainval/6xsvGYIxJok/50010 AND THEY SAY 18
trainval/6xsvGYIxJok/50011 43 AND YOU PAY
trainval/6xsvGYIxJok/50012 AS OPPOSED TO NOW I'M GOING TO PAY 20
trainval/6xsvGYIxJok/50013 IS THIS ALL A BIG DEAL
trainval/6xsvGYIxJok/50014 I CONSIDER THOSE TO BE MAKING AN IMPACT AS WELL
trainval/6xtmm0MnaS0/50001 THE 1ST QUESTION
trainval/6xtmm0MnaS0/50002 THE MALES' ANSWERS WERE DECISIVE
trainval/6xtmm0MnaS0/50003 THEY CAN ACTUALLY REACH UNIVERSITY LEVEL
trainval/6xtmm0MnaS0/50004 BUT THEN WHEN YOU GO TO THE WORKFORCE YOU FIND THAT THERE ARE LESS GIRLS
trainval/6xtmm0MnaS0/50005 BECAUSE EVEN WHEN YOU GO TO GET THE JOB IN SOME CERTAIN WORKPLACE THEY SAY
trainval/6xtmm0MnaS0/50006 WE DON'T WANT FEMALES WE WANT MALES
trainval/6xtmm0MnaS0/50007 AND I THOUGHT WHY DON'T PEOPLE WANT TO ACHIEVE THEIR DREAMS
trainval/6xtmm0MnaS0/50008 HER MOTHER SAYS
trainval/6xy5pWOgeBY/50001 WHY WOULD SOMEBODY NOT RECYCLE
trainval/6xy5pWOgeBY/50002 THINK ABOUT THIS
trainval/6xy5pWOgeBY/50003 THIS MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE QUESTION
trainval/6xy5pWOgeBY/50004 IN THE SECOND THEY HAD TO PUT HALF OF IT BACK
trainval/6ydYeyNSQVY/50001 WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO WORK ALMOST ANYWHERE AT ANY TIME
trainval/6ydYeyNSQVY/50002 IT PROMOTES ENGAGEMENT AND COLLABORATION
trainval/6ydYeyNSQVY/50003 IT MAKES YOU MORE PRODUCTIVE AND TASK FOCUSED
trainval/6YKYo00mFAg/50001 FOR EXAMPLE IT BECOMES POSSIBLE TO SIMULATE A PROCEDURE BEFORE ACTUAL
trainval/6yR5OUVb2gY/50001 AND I MET THE JAPANESE LADY'S FAMILY AND I ASKED THEM IF THEY WOULD WORK WITH ME AND HELP ME WRITE THIS BOOK
trainval/6yR5OUVb2gY/50002 SURE WE CAN DEMAND THAT OUR GOVERNMENTS HAVE HIGH LEVEL DISCUSSIONS TO ELIMINATE THE WEAPONS OF WAR BUT WE CAN COME
trainval/6yR5OUVb2gY/50003 EIGHTY PERCENT OF RIKUZENTAKADA WAS WASHED AWAY
trainval/6yR5OUVb2gY/50004 THEY WERE DOING SO MANY KINDS OF PROJECTS
trainval/6yR5OUVb2gY/50005 AND SHE KNEW THAT SHE LIVED TOO BECAUSE OF IT
trainval/6yR5OUVb2gY/50006 BUT NOBODY COULD IMAGINE WHAT WAS COMING
trainval/6yR5OUVb2gY/50007 I KIND OF FELT LIKE FORREST GUMP
trainval/6yR5OUVb2gY/50008 HE'S THE DOUBLE SURVIVOR THEY CALL HIM
trainval/6yR5OUVb2gY/50009 HE WAS A SHIP DESIGNER
trainval/6yR5OUVb2gY/50010 HE WAS SEVERELY BURNT
trainval/6yR5OUVb2gY/50011 HE TOLD HIS CO WORKERS WHAT HAPPENED
trainval/6yR5OUVb2gY/50013 HOW COULD ONE BOMB DESTROY AN ENTIRE CITY
trainval/6yR5OUVb2gY/50014 MY FATHER TAUGHT ME HOW TO BE ABOVE THAT
trainval/6ZiN9ZJT294/50001 KIDS DON'T PLAN THINGS OUT
trainval/6ZiN9ZJT294/50002 ADULTS PLAN OUT EVERY LITTLE SECOND OF THEIR DAY BEFORE IT HAPPENS
trainval/6ZiN9ZJT294/50003 DO YOU EVER WONDER WHY
trainval/6ZiN9ZJT294/50004 SHE HAS A HUGE IMAGINATION
trainval/6zVS8HIPUng/50001 IT'S PARTLY DEPENDENT ON THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THE ANIMAL OR THE HUMAN IS IN AND THE SYNAPSES THAT ARE
trainval/6zVS8HIPUng/50002 YOU PRUNE AWAY THE WEAKER BRANCHES SO THAT THE REMAINING IMPORTANT BRANCHES CAN GROW STRONGER
trainval/6zVS8HIPUng/50003 SO A SECOND LINE OF INQUIRY THAT WE USE TO TRACK CHANGES IN THE ADOLESCENT BRAIN IS USING FUNCTIONAL
trainval/6zVS8HIPUng/50004 SO IN MY LAB WE BRING ADOLESCENTS AND ADULTS INTO THE LAB TO HAVE A BRAIN SCAN WE GIVE THEM SOME KIND
trainval/6zVS8HIPUng/50005 SO FOR EXAMPLE TAKE RISK TAKING
trainval/6zVS8HIPUng/50006 THEY HAD NO CHOICE
trainval/6zVS8HIPUng/50007 IT'S A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY FOR LEARNING AND CREATIVITY
trainval/6zVS8HIPUng/50008 IT ACTUALLY REFLECTS CHANGES IN THE BRAIN THAT PROVIDE AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY FOR
trainval/70uaS1e9YN0/50001 WHY DO I HAVE CANCER
trainval/70uaS1e9YN0/50002 YET COMPARATIVELY WE HAVE ABOUT A DOZEN TARGETED MEDICATIONS
trainval/70uaS1e9YN0/50003 WHY IS THAT
trainval/70uaS1e9YN0/50004 AND THE VERY UNSATISFYING YET SCIENTIFIC ANSWER IS
trainval/70uaS1e9YN0/50005 IT'S TOO HARD
trainval/70uaS1e9YN0/50006 SO WE DEVELOPED AN IDEA A RATIONALE THAT PERHAPS IF WE MADE A MOLECULE THAT PREVENTED THE POST IT
trainval/70uaS1e9YN0/50007 WE THOUGHT WE'D JUST SEND IT TO PEOPLE AND SEE HOW THE MOLECULE BEHAVES
trainval/70uaS1e9YN0/50008 THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THERE'S NO MOUSE MODEL OF THIS RARE CANCER
trainval/70uaS1e9YN0/50009 WELL THEY PROBABLY WOULD KEEP THIS A SECRET UNTIL THEY TURN THE PROTOTYPE DRUG INTO AN ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL
trainval/70uaS1e9YN0/50010 AND WE'RE ABLE FINALLY TO ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT'S BEEN SO PRESSING FOR SO MANY YEARS
trainval/70uaS1e9YN0/50011 WE DON'T HAVE A TEAM OF SALESPEOPLE AND MARKETEERS TO TELL US HOW TO POSITION THIS DRUG AGAINST THE OTHER
trainval/70uaS1e9YN0/50012 THE FIRST IS
trainval/70uaS1e9YN0/50013 YET THIS INFORMATION IS LARGELY A SECRET
trainval/70uaS1e9YN0/50015 THIS RESEARCH IS FUNDED BY THE PUBLIC
trainval/70uaS1e9YN0/50016 AND ONE THING I'VE LEARNED IN BOSTON IS THAT YOU PEOPLE WILL DO ANYTHING FOR CANCER AND I LOVE THAT
trainval/70VZ1SOzSnc/50001 I THOUGHT I WOULD START WITH A VERY BRIEF HISTORY OF CITIES
trainval/70VZ1SOzSnc/50002 YOU HAD AUTO NETWORKS
trainval/70VZ1SOzSnc/50003 AS DANIELLE SAID MORE THAN HALF THE PEOPLE NOW IN THE WORLD LIVE IN CITIES AND THAT WILL JUST CONTINUE TO
trainval/70VZ1SOzSnc/50004 THEY'RE QUITE FUN
trainval/70VZ1SOzSnc/50005 SO WE WENT BACK AND STARTED LOOKING AT THE GREAT CITIES THAT EVOLVED BEFORE THE CARS
trainval/70VZ1SOzSnc/50006 AND THEN YOU LOOK AT CITIES THAT EVOLVED AFTER THE AUTOMOBILE AND IT'S NOT THAT KIND OF A PATTERN
trainval/70VZ1SOzSnc/50007 SO WE SAID LET'S START WITH THAT NEIGHBORHOOD CELL
trainval/70VZ1SOzSnc/50008 WE THINK OF IT AS A COMPACT URBAN CELL
trainval/70VZ1SOzSnc/50009 AND THEN WE CAN FORM IN EFFECT A MESH NETWORK
trainval/70VZ1SOzSnc/50010 GO UP TO 50000 IF IT'S MANHATTAN DENSITY
trainval/70VZ1SOzSnc/50011 CONNECTED TO MASS TRANSIT
trainval/70VZ1SOzSnc/50012 ACTUALLY WE COULD DO THIS TODAY
trainval/70VZ1SOzSnc/50013 THESE ARE SOME OF THE VEHICLES THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON
trainval/70VZ1SOzSnc/50014 I MEAN ARCHITECTS HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THESE IDEAS FOR A LONG TIME
trainval/70VZ1SOzSnc/50015 WE THINK WE CAN ALSO PERSONALIZE SUNLIGHT
trainval/70VZ1SOzSnc/50016 THAT'S SORT OF THE ULTIMATE PERSONALIZATION IN SOME WAYS
trainval/70VZ1SOzSnc/50017 BUT IN THE END THE MAIN THING WE NEED TO FOCUS ON ARE PEOPLE
trainval/70VZ1SOzSnc/50018 CITIES ARE ALL ABOUT PEOPLE
trainval/70VZ1SOzSnc/50019 WE HAVE TO GET THIS RIGHT
trainval/70VZ1SOzSnc/50020 WE'RE NOT DOING A VERY GOOD JOB WITH THAT
trainval/73cTNHEQhkQ/50001 IT'S DIFFERENT CULTURE IT'S A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT A DIFFERENT BIOLOGICAL SENSE TO WHAT IT
trainval/73cTNHEQhkQ/50002 IT'S THE DOORWAY OPEN TO ALL CREATIVITY INNOVATION
trainval/73cTNHEQhkQ/50003 BUT WHEN WE DON'T ASK THAT QUESTION WHAT DO WE NORMALLY GET
trainval/73cTNHEQhkQ/50004 YOU MAY SAY JIM I'M NOT BUYING THIS IDEA THAT YOU GET ALL THIS CUSTOM MADE STUFF
trainval/73cTNHEQhkQ/50005 BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE EITHER
trainval/73cTNHEQhkQ/50006 IF WE HAVE DONE THAT BUILDING YOU MIGHT HAVE GONE TO IT AND I'M PRETTY SURE YOU'VE NEVER INVITE ME TO TALK TO YOU ON THIS STAGE
trainval/73cTNHEQhkQ/50007 SO WHAT MIGHT THAT DIFFERENT WAY BE
trainval/73cTNHEQhkQ/50008 SO I HAVE A LITTLE TEST FOR YOU
trainval/73cTNHEQhkQ/50011 SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO
trainval/73cTNHEQhkQ/50012 AND SO WE GET THEIR APPROVAL
trainval/73cTNHEQhkQ/50013 WE FIGURED IT OUT
trainval/73cTNHEQhkQ/50014 AND IS THAT SOMEHOW HELP US AS A COMMUNITY OF LEARNERS WHO ARE TRYING TO SEARCH OUT AND
trainval/73rUjrow5pI/50001 BUT BLOOD IS ALSO CHALLENGING BECAUSE IT HAS A VERY SHORT SHELF LIFE THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT
trainval/73rUjrow5pI/50002 THEY ENDED UP SENDING SEVEN UNITS OF RED BLOOD CELLS FOUR UNITS OF PLASMA AND TWO UNITS OF PLATELETS
trainval/73rUjrow5pI/50003 AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT OUR AUTONOMOUS FLEET OF VEHICLES RELIES ON THAT CELLULAR NETWORK
trainval/73rUjrow5pI/50004 OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS AS WE START SERVING PRIVATE HEALTH CARE FACILITIES WE'LL ALSO USE THAT MOBILE PAYMENT PLATFORM
trainval/73rUjrow5pI/50005 AND I DO MEAN EAST AFRICA NOT JUST RWANDA
trainval/73rUjrow5pI/50006 ONE THING THAT PEOPLE I THINK OFTEN MISS IS THAT THESE KINDS OF LEAPS GENERATE COMPOUNDING GAINS
trainval/73rUjrow5pI/50007 THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO CHANGE
trainval/73rUjrow5pI/50008 SO WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DECELERATE THE PLANE FROM ABOUT 100 KILOMETERS AN HOUR TO ZERO IN HALF OF A SECOND
trainval/73rUjrow5pI/50009 SO THEY GET IT
trainval/73rUjrow5pI/50010 SO I WAS ASKING EARLIER WHO IS GOING TO BE CREATING THE DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50001 ANYBODY CAN PLAY IN THE GAME
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50002 IF THEY HAVE THE PRICE OF ENTRY INTO AN INTERNET CAFE THE LAST TIME I LOOKED IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE A POUND AN
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50003 AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS NOT THAT THE AGE OF THE STATE IS OVER
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50004 THE STATE STILL MATTERS
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50005 BUT THE STAGE IS CROWDED
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50006 THE STATE'S NOT ALONE
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50007 THERE ARE MANY MANY ACTORS
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50008 AND YOU CAN THINK BACK TO 1941 WHEN THE GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN ATTACKED THE UNITED STATES
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50009 YOU MIGHT THINK OF THAT AS THE PRIVATIZATION OF WAR
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50010 FOR EXAMPLE THE GREAT OXFORD HISTORIAN WHO TAUGHT HERE AT THIS UNIVERSITY A
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50011 BUT WE NEED A NEW NARRATIVE IF WE'RE TO UNDERSTAND POWER IN THE 21ST CENTURY
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50012 IT'S NOT JUST PREVAILING AT WAR THOUGH WAR STILL PERSISTS
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50013 THE NARRATIVES THAT WE USE NOW TEND TO BE THE RISE AND FALL OF THE GREAT POWERS
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50014 FIRST OF ALL IT'S A LINEAR PROJECTION
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50015 THE MORAL OF THIS STORY IS ALL THESE NARRATIVES ABOUT RISE AND FALL AND DECLINE TELL US A LOT MORE ABOUT
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50016 CHINA STILL HAS LARGE AREAS OF UNDERDEVELOPMENT AND PER CAPITA INCOME IS A BETTER MEASURE OF
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50017 AND THAT THE CHINESE WON'T CATCH UP OR PASS THE AMERICANS UNTIL SOMEWHERE IN THE LATTER PART AFTER
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50018 LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE FROM HISTORY
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50019 THUCYDIDES THE GREAT HISTORIAN OF THE THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR SAID IT WAS THE RISE IN THE POWER OF
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50020 NOTICE BOTH HALVES OF THAT EXPLANATION
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50021 IT'S BAD HISTORY
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50022 FOR ONE THING GERMANY HAD SURPASSED BRITAIN IN INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH BY 1900
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50023 AND AS I SAID EARLIER CHINA HAS NOT PASSED THE UNITED STATES
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50024 TO PARAPHRASE FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT FROM A DIFFERENT CONTEXT THE GREATEST THING WE HAVE TO FEAR
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50025 POWER IS MULTI POLAR
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50026 THERE ARE BALANCERS THE U
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50027 THE BOTTOM BOARD OF THIS THREE DIMENSIONAL THE BOARD OF TRANSNATIONAL RELATIONS THINGS THAT
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50028 POWER IS CHAOTICALLY DISTRIBUTED
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50029 AND THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS AND THIS IS WHERE MANY GREATEST CHALLENGES ARE COMING IN THIS CENTURY
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50030 SO WE'VE GOT WHAT 17 MORE YEARS TO GO OR SO BEFORE CHINA'S BIGGER
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50031 SO EMPOWERING CHINA TO DEAL WITH ITS OWN PROBLEMS OF CARBON
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50032 NOW I DON'T MEAN TO BE POLLYANNAISH ABOUT THIS
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50033 KEEPING BALANCES IS IMPORTANT
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50034 ALL THIS STILL PERSISTS
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50035 HARD POWER IS THERE AND IT WILL REMAIN
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50037 AND THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS I HAVE
trainval/796LfXwzIUk/50038 AND IN THE 21ST CENTURY YOU HAVE TO DO AN ANALOG TO THAT
trainval/79tRTivyMSM/50001 LONG HOURS NIGHT SHIFTS AND YOU DON'T GET ANYMORE UNPREDICTABLE HOURS THAN MIDWIFERY
trainval/79tRTivyMSM/50002 WHO IS WILLING TO MAKE SACRIFICES FOR THEIR CAREER
trainval/79tRTivyMSM/50003 SO IT SEEMS THAT MAYBE IT'S JUST QUITE SIMPLE WOMEN JUST DON'T MAKE THESE SACRIFICES
trainval/79tRTivyMSM/50004 THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO FEEL THAT THEY HAVE A POOR WORK LIFE BALANCE
trainval/79tRTivyMSM/50005 AND THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO MAKE SACRIFICES IN THEIR CAREERS
trainval/79tRTivyMSM/50006 BUT FAR FROM BEING INNATE THE RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THESE DECISIONS AND THESE
trainval/79tRTivyMSM/50007 I THINK THE FIRST OF THESE IS THAT WORK LIFE BALANCE IS NOT JUST ABOUT WOMEN
trainval/79tRTivyMSM/50008 THAT THEY CAN IMAGINE SUCCEEDING IN THOSE ROLES
trainval/79tRTivyMSM/50009 AND THAT THEY CAN BE CONFIDENT THAT THE SACRIFICES THAT THEY MAKE AND INDEED WE ALL MAKE WILL BE WORTH IT IN THE
trainval/79zra755WgA/50001 AND I LIKE DOING THAT
trainval/79zra755WgA/50002 IT INFECTS A LOT OF PEOPLE
trainval/79zra755WgA/50003 HOW WOULD YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE A DOCTOR
trainval/79zra755WgA/50004 I ASSUME SOMEONE TELLS YOU
trainval/79zra755WgA/50005 YOU CAN THINK OF THE CLICHE EXAMPLES LIKE ELON MUSK RICHARD BRANSON STEVE JOBS
trainval/79zra755WgA/50006 WHOEVER INSPIRES YOU THE MOST THE QUESTION IS
trainval/79zra755WgA/50007 SO WHY I AM A HUGE FAN OF WEIRDNESS IS IT'S MY DOGMATIC BELIEF IT ALWAYS LEADS US
trainval/79zra755WgA/50008 IN FACT I BELIEVE TO SOME DEGREE ALL OF US EXPERIENCED AS A CHILD TIMES WHEN WE WOULD ACTUALLY STEP
trainval/79zra755WgA/50009 BUT I STARTED TO REALIZE SOMETHING
trainval/79zra755WgA/50010 AS LONG AS I'M WORSHIPING OTHER PEOPLE'S APPROVAL I CAN NEVER ACCEPT MYSELF
trainval/79zra755WgA/50011 BECAUSE IF WE'RE NOT WILLING TO EMBRACE DISCOMFORT THAT MEANS I AM ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS
trainval/79zra755WgA/50012 SHE'S TALKING ABOUT WEIRDNESS
trainval/79zra755WgA/50013 BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ME NOT YOU SO ENOUGH ABOUT YOU
trainval/79zra755WgA/50014 OR WE THINK WE'RE THE ONLY ONE WITH A HOME THAT'S BROKEN BUT WE'RE MEANT TO PRETEND IT'S NOT BROKEN WE
trainval/79zra755WgA/50015 AND WE ARE ALWAYS SAYING YES OR NO TO IT
trainval/7A66iZQXNh4/50001 BUT EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM HAS A STORY
trainval/7c5t6FkvUG0/50001 AND I SAID SOMETHING SO AWESOME AND GREAT
trainval/7c5t6FkvUG0/50002 ALL HE WANTED WAS A MOM ALL I WANTED WAS A CHILD
trainval/7c5t6FkvUG0/50003 MY LOVE HAS GROWN BUT IS MY LOVE THAT GREAT
trainval/7c5t6FkvUG0/50004 WE HAVE FOUND THE MILLER'S CHILD WAS THE MESSAGE
trainval/7CmqNpCofc8/50001 AND OF COURSE THIS IMPACTED ME VERY DEEPLY
trainval/7CmqNpCofc8/50002 IT'S HALFWAY BETWEEN LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO
trainval/7CmqNpCofc8/50003 AND HE RELENTED AND ORDERED THE MRI
trainval/7CmqNpCofc8/50004 AND THAT'S THE THOUGHT OF HAVING BRAIN DAMAGE
trainval/7CmqNpCofc8/50005 90 OF IT FACEBOOK NO FORUMS NO NOT GOOD INFORMATION
trainval/7CmqNpCofc8/50006 IT WAS PERFECT
trainval/7CmqNpCofc8/50007 THUS I WOULD HAVE NO CRANIOTOMY NO MOVEMENT OF MY BRAIN AND THIS WOULD ELIMINATE THE RISK OF
trainval/7CmqNpCofc8/50008 CAN WE GET THAT
trainval/7DCofMA9eQA/50001 SO WE SET OUT TO SEE WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO BUILD A VERMICULTURE PROGRAM
trainval/7DCofMA9eQA/50002 WE SPENT VIRTUALLY NO MONEY TO BUILD THIS PROGRAM
trainval/7DCofMA9eQA/50003 PACHOLKE BOUGHT US AN AIR PUMP AND TAUGHT US HOW TO MAKE LIQUID FERTILIZER FROM THE CASTINGS
trainval/7DCofMA9eQA/50004 WELL THAT'S THE SECOND PART OF THE STORY THAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU
trainval/7DCofMA9eQA/50005 JILER DESCRIBES A PLACE THAT IS WELL KNOWN FOR GANG VIOLENCE AND IT REPORTS OF RECIDIVISM RATE UP OF
trainval/7DCofMA9eQA/50006 AS WE WERE DRIVING AWAY AND I WAS PLAYING WITH MY NEW FOUND TOY WE NEVER GAVE A SECOND THOUGHT TO THE GARBAGE WE
trainval/7DCofMA9eQA/50007 AND LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED
trainval/7DESF3jSPVo/50002 AND HOW IS MY BREATH
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50001 KIDS ARE ACTUALLY VERY NATURAL PHILOSOPHERS
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50002 AND INITIALLY SOME KIDS WILL THINK IT'S WRONG BECAUSE WE GET PUNISHED FOR IT
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50003 BUT THEN WE CAN HELP THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS OF DISCUSSION TO COME TO SEE THAT WE PUNISH THOSE THINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50004 THEY ARE NOT WRONG BECAUSE THEY ARE PUNISHED
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50005 WE HAVE TO GET THE ARROW GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WE CAN BUILD THESE REALLY INTERESTING DEEP CONVERSATIONS WITH KIDS
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50006 THEY ASK THESE KINDS OF QUESTIONS ON THEIR OWN
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50007 IMAGINE YOU HAVE A BOAT
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50008 OVER THE COURSE OF TIME MAYBE FIVE YEARS YOU ACTUALLY REPLACE EVERY SINGLE BOARD OR EVERY SINGLE PART OF THE BOAT
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50009 IF YOU THINK IT IS THE SAME BOAT WHY
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50010 WHAT REMAINS THE SAME THROUGH THAT PROCESS OF CHANGE OVER TIME
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50011 AND IF YOU THINK IT'S NOT THE SAME BOAT WELL NOW TELL ME WHEN DID IT NOT BECOME THE SAME BOAT
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50012 AT WHAT POINT IN THIS PROCESS OF CHANGE WOULD YOU HAVE SAID AH NO YOU HAVE A NEW BOAT
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50013 AND IT'S OUR JOB TO HELP GIVE THEM UPTAKE ON THOSE QUESTIONS
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50014 AND THEN STARTING WITH THE BOAT WE CAN TRANSLATE THAT INTO A DISCUSSION ABOUT PERSONAL IDENTITY HUMAN IDENTITY
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50015 WE'RE CREATURES WHO CHANGE OVER TIME
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50016 ARE WE REALLY THE SAME AS OUR EARLIER SELVES
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50017 AND WHAT ALLOWS US TO MAKE THAT KIND OF CLAIM
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50018 EITHER REMAINS THE SAME OR HOW DO YOU RETAIN AN IDENTITY OVER ALL OF THIS CHANGE
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50019 PHILOSOPHERS WANT TO KNOW FOR INSTANCE IF WE ARE REALLY FREE
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50020 AND WHAT IT WOULD MEAN FOR US TO SAY THAT WE'RE FREE
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50021 MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY INSANE IMPOSSIBLE
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50022 BUT A LOT OF PHILOSOPHERS BELIEVE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN BE FREE
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50023 IF WE ARE BOTH DETERMINED AND FREE
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50024 OR WE'LL ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF RIGHT AND WRONG
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50025 HOW WOULD WE KNOW IF IT DOES
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50026 HOW DO WE MAKE MEANING IN OUR LIVES KNOWING THAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50027 THESE ARE THE KINDS OF PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50028 EVEN CAN YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW THAT YOU'RE NOT DREAMING
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50030 SO THESE ARE THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS THAT PHILOSOPHERS ASK AND LIKE I SAID I THINK KIDS ASK THEM VERY NATURALLY
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50031 ADULTS HAVE A MUCH HARDER TIME ASKING THEM
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50032 THEY ARE WONDERING ABOUT WHERE THEY ARE AND HOW THE WORLD WORKS AND WHAT THEIR PLACE IS IN IT
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50033 WHEN I'VE GONE INTO CLASSES AND I'VE WORKED WITH THIRD GRADE UP THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE IN HIGH SCHOOL
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50034 AND IT'S AMAZING WHAT THEY COME UP WITH
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50035 AND WHY DO WE START WARS
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50036 WE NEED TO ENGAGE KIDS ON THE QUESTIONS THAT THEY HAVE
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50037 THEY'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THEIR WORLD
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50038 AND MAKE MEANING IN IT
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50039 SO THEY DON'T REALLY GET UPTAKE IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IN PART BECAUSE TEACHERS AREN'T TRAINED TO DEAL WITH THOSE KINDS OF
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50040 THE ANSWERS ARE AMBIGUOUS
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50041 YOU CAN'T TEACH THAT FOR THE TEST VERY EASILY
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50042 WE'RE INCREASINGLY GETTING FUNNELED IN THAT DIRECTION IN EDUCATION
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50043 BUT EVEN AT HOME I THINK OFTEN THEY DON'T GET UPTAKE
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50044 PHILOSOPHY IS UNDERSTOOD TO BE A DEEP ABSTRACT RIGOROUS DIFFICULT KIND OF DISCIPLINE
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50045 AND SO WE FUMBLE RIGHT AND MAYBE WE PUT IT OFF A LITTLE BIT AND WE DON'T ACTUALLY ADDRESS THEM
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50046 AND THE RESULT IS THAT KIDS THINK THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT DON'T MATTER
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50047 BUT THEY DO MATTER
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50048 SO WHAT ARE PHILOSOPHERS KNOWN FOR
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50049 AND THE BEAUTIFUL THING ABOUT THEM IS THEY DON'T TAKE ANY LAB SPACE
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50050 WE DON'T NEED BEAKERS OR CHEMICALS THERE'S NO SAFETY TRAINING
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50051 IMAGINE THAT YOU FIND A RING AND IF YOU TWIST THAT RING IT MAKES YOU INVISIBLE
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50052 AND ONCE WE FIGURE OUT WHY THEY WOULD DO
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50053 WHY DO YOU NOT DO THOSE THINGS WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE RING
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50054 WHAT STOPS YOU
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50055 WHAT IS BRAVERY
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50056 WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THAT THING
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50057 IS IT STANDING UP IN THE FACE OF YOUR OWN FEAR AND DOING SOMETHING
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50058 SO WE DEVELOP THESE REALLY INTERESTING DISCUSSIONS OUT OF LITERATURE OUT OF PUZZLES OUT OF THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS AND WE HAVE
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50060 WE WANT TO ENHANCE THEIR COGNITIVE SKILLS
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50061 CRITICAL THINKING RIGHT
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50062 THOSE ARE GOOD SKILLS THAT ARE GOING TO DO WELL FOR THEM IN OTHER KINDS OF ENDEAVORS AS WELL
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50063 COME UP WITH A COUNTEREXAMPLE
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50064 YOUR FRIEND JUST MADE THIS CLAIM CAN YOU IMAGINE A COUNTEREXAMPLE OR A DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVE
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50065 SAY WHAT IT IS AND SHOW HOW IT MEETS THAT PERSON'S CLAIM
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50066 ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS IS YOU'LL GET BEST FRIENDS SAYING I NEVER REALIZED I COULD REALLY DISAGREE WITH HIM ABOUT SOMETHING
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50067 I THINK THIS IS REALLY EMPOWERING FOR THEM
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50068 AND WHAT WE'VE FOUND NOT ONLY IN OUR OWN WORK WHERE KIDS REALLY ENJOY IT AND LOVE IT BUT IN WORK DONE AROUND THE
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50069 AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT EDUCATION IS ALL ABOUT
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50070 THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO DO PHILOSOPHY
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50071 SO WE'LL USE EVEN SIMPLE THINGS LIKE ARNOLD LOBEL'S FROG AND TOAD ADVENTURES
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50072 WE'LL TALK ABOUT BRAVERY
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50073 FROG AND TOAD RUN AWAY FROM A LOT OF THINGS ALL THE TIME SAYING WE'RE VERY BRAVE
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50074 LOOK AT US RUN AWAY FROM THE SNAKE BUT WE'RE BEING VERY BRAVE
trainval/7DLzXAjscXk/50075 SO WE HAVE AN INTERESTING DISCUSSION WITH THE KIDS
trainval/7E9a24Nw6Cg/50001 THERE ARE NO EXAMPLES
trainval/7FecGsXFgcQ/50001 WHY DO WE DO IT THIS WAY
trainval/7H0USvVSfhU/50001 NAYSAWN JOINED THE HUB BECAUSE HE WAS WORKING FROM HOME ALL THE TIME
trainval/7H0USvVSfhU/50002 THEY MEET BECAUSE THEY HAVE A CAFFEINE FIX AND THEY WANT COFFEE BEFORE ANY OF THE HOSTS ARE THERE TO MAKE COFFEE
trainval/7H0USvVSfhU/50003 SO THAT MEANS THAT AS CITY DWELLERS WE ARE ONLY RUNNING INTO EACH OTHER BASICALLY HURRYING TO AND FROM OUR WORK OUR
trainval/7H0USvVSfhU/50004 SO THAT MEANS YOU ARE CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT THAT HAS A MISSION AND A REASON BEHIND IT SO PEOPLE KNOW HOW TO REACT AND RESPOND WHEN
trainval/7HD3lrb6VtM/50001 HOW CAN WE GO TO A GREATER BATTLE
trainval/7hFy02TSH4U/50001 THIS IS THE NEWEST TREND FROM SEVERAL WEEKS AGO IN LOVE AFFAIRS
trainval/7hFy02TSH4U/50002 WHAT DOES IT MEAN
trainval/7hFy02TSH4U/50004 SUBCONTRACTING IS WHEN ON THE ONE HAND YOU GET RID OF THE RISK AND ON THE OTHER HAND YOU LOWER THE COSTS
trainval/7hFy02TSH4U/50005 SO SOMEONE ELSE DOES THE JOB INSTEAD OF YOU
trainval/7hFy02TSH4U/50006 WITHOUT THE FALL THERE IS NO FALLING IN LOVE
trainval/7hFy02TSH4U/50007 SO WHAT TERMS SUCH AS OUTSOURCING OR SUBCONTRACTING EXEMPLIFY IS THAT
trainval/7hFy02TSH4U/50008 OK YOU MIGHT POSE THE QUESTION
trainval/7hFy02TSH4U/50009 AND ESPECIALLY SO WHEN IT COMES TO LOVE
trainval/7hFy02TSH4U/50010 SO WHAT ALL THESE EXAMPLES SHOW ESPECIALLY MASTURDATING AND SOLO WEDDING IS THAT WE ARE
trainval/7hFy02TSH4U/50011 WHY DID HE DIE
trainval/7hFy02TSH4U/50012 BUT WHAT ALL THESE NEW TRENDS AND ALL THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES REINFORCE TODAY IN THE 21ST
trainval/7hFy02TSH4U/50013 THANKS A LOT
trainval/7hWUhEA6hxk/50001 IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY AT SCIENCE FROM THE LAST FEW DECADES A VERY DIFFERENT LESSON EMERGES
trainval/7hWUhEA6hxk/50002 WE ARE DESIGNED TO UPGRADE ON OUR OWN
trainval/7hWUhEA6hxk/50003 USING MRI SCANS NEUROSCIENTISTS HAVE SEEN THE SUBTLE PHYSICAL CHANGES IN THE
trainval/7hWUhEA6hxk/50005 AND THAT'S TRUE YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR GENES
trainval/7hWUhEA6hxk/50006 THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL THING ABOUT DNA IS THAT IT'S STABLE
trainval/7hWUhEA6hxk/50007 NOW ADMITTEDLY WE DO NOT HAVE THE PERFECT EXAMPLES YET IN HUMAN BEINGS
trainval/7hWUhEA6hxk/50008 WHY IS THAT
trainval/7hWUhEA6hxk/50009 THIS IS WHERE THE STORY GETS A LITTLE STRANGE AND TO ME VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE FOR A LONG TIME
trainval/7hWUhEA6hxk/50010 IT'S CALLED EPIGENETIC INHERITANCE
trainval/7Iv2nZnZOrM/50001 THEY ARE TOO BUSY RECALCULATING WHAT THIS ALL MEAN FOR LOST TIME
trainval/7Iv2nZnZOrM/50002 HIS FINGERS FIND THE PILLOWCASE'S SAILING MASTS
trainval/7Iv2nZnZOrM/50003 HE TURNS ON HIS SIDE
trainval/7Iv2nZnZOrM/50004 OPENS HIS EYES AT ONCE
trainval/7Iv2nZnZOrM/50005 HE THINKS THAT SCUBA DIVERS MUST HAVE THE MOST WONDERFUL JOB IN THE WORLD
trainval/7Iv2nZnZOrM/50006 SO MUCH WATER TO GLIDE THROUGH
trainval/7Iv2nZnZOrM/50007 I DON'T MEAN THIS METAPHORICALLY
trainval/7Iv2nZnZOrM/50008 IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
trainval/7Iv2nZnZOrM/50009 I BUSIED MYSELF TELLING STORIES AND SHARING STORIES AND COLLECTING THEM
trainval/7Iv2nZnZOrM/50010 AND LAST YEAR I TRIED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME AND I WAS THRILLED BY THE EFFICIENCY AT WHICH I WAS ABLE TO PRODUCE
trainval/7Iv2nZnZOrM/50011 BUT AT THE END OF THE MONTH I LOOKED BACK AT THESE 30 POEMS I HAD WRITTEN AND DISCOVERED THAT THEY WERE ALL TRYING
trainval/7Iv2nZnZOrM/50012 AND I USE POETRY IN MY LIFE AS A WAY TO HELP ME NAVIGATE AND WORK THROUGH THINGS
trainval/7Iv2nZnZOrM/50013 BUT JUST BECAUSE I END THE POEM DOESN'T MEAN THAT I'VE SOLVED WHATEVER I WAS PUZZLING THROUGH
trainval/7Iv2nZnZOrM/50014 I LIKE TO REVISIT OLD POETRY BECAUSE IT SHOWS ME EXACTLY WHERE I WAS AT THAT MOMENT
trainval/7Iv2nZnZOrM/50015 AND WHAT IT WAS I WAS TRYING TO NAVIGATE AND THE WORDS THAT I CHOSE TO HELP ME
trainval/7Iv2nZnZOrM/50016 IT WASN'T ALWAYS EASY
trainval/7Iv2nZnZOrM/50018 HE SHOWED UP AT WORLD WAR II WITH A SMIRK AND A HOBBY
trainval/7Iv2nZnZOrM/50019 BEFORE SHE WAS WIFE SHE WAS ARTIST
trainval/7Iv2nZnZOrM/50020 AND THE ONLY TWO ROOMS IN THE HOUSE WITH WALLS THAT REACHED ALL THE WAY UP TO THE CEILING AND DOORS THAT OPENED AND CLOSED WERE THE
trainval/7Iv2nZnZOrM/50021 THEY GOT MARRIED
trainval/7Iv2nZnZOrM/50022 MOVED TO A HOUSE NEAR A PARK
trainval/7Iv2nZnZOrM/50023 BUT THEY KEPT THE LOFT AT WOOSTER STREET FOR BIRTHDAY PARTIES AND TREASURE HUNTS
trainval/7Iv2nZnZOrM/50024 THEY NAMED HIM SWEET POTATO
trainval/7Iv2nZnZOrM/50026 HIS FIRST TIME OUT HE FOLLOWED THE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS DOTTING THEIR WAY THROUGH NEW YORK CITY'S TREES
trainval/7Iv2nZnZOrM/50027 TINY DOTS OF LIGHT BLINKING OUT OF HIM FROM OUT OF THE DARKEST DARKS
trainval/7Iv2nZnZOrM/50028 A YEAR LATER HE TRAVELED ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO FOLLOW A FOREST FIRE STAYED FOR A WEEK HUNTING IT WITH HIS
trainval/7Iv2nZnZOrM/50029 WE HAVE BOTH LEARNED THE ART OF CAPTURE
trainval/7JQbyvNjM74/50001 MY TAKE AWAY FROM THAT IS THAT IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE SOMEONE ELSE'S MIND YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR OWN
trainval/7JQbyvNjM74/50002 IT WILL GET YOU THROUGH THE OBSTACLES THAT YOU ARE INEVITABLY GOING TO FACE
trainval/7JQbyvNjM74/50003 REMEMBER THE WORDLE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME
trainval/7jRND5IU3Qg/50001 WE HAVE BIG STRESSORS
trainval/7jRND5IU3Qg/50002 WHEN WE COMPARE THE BRAIN SCANS OF VIETNAM VETS WITH THE BRAIN SCANS OF CHRONICALLY
trainval/7jRND5IU3Qg/50003 WE LIVE IN SURVIVAL MODE
trainval/7jRND5IU3Qg/50004 RESEARCH TELLS US THAT LASTING CHANGE DOESN'T COME FROM DRASTIC LIFE
trainval/7jRND5IU3Qg/50005 SHE WENT FROM ANTICIPATING ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING LIFE CHANGING EVENTS
trainval/7jRND5IU3Qg/50006 THEY NO LONGER SEND US INTO A PANICKED DOWNWARD SPIRAL
trainval/7jx0dTYUO5E/50001 IT WAS REMARKABLE
trainval/7jx0dTYUO5E/50002 IT TOOK ABOUT ONE MINUTE
trainval/7jx0dTYUO5E/50003 AND THEY MASTURBATED
trainval/7KtAbgvGEvY/50001 AND HE DID HE JUMPED BACKWARDS
trainval/7KtAbgvGEvY/50002 I HAVE SEEN ONE OLYMPIC CEREMONY AND IT WAS AWFUL
trainval/7KtAbgvGEvY/50003 I CAN DO THE ADVERTISING FOR THE OLYMPIC GAMES IF YOU WANT
trainval/7KtAbgvGEvY/50004 IT WOULD BE A DISASTER
trainval/7KtAbgvGEvY/50005 SO THAT'S TO BE RICH NOT TO HAVE TO WAKE UP IN THE MORNING
trainval/7LcSdlVrg5M/50002 BHUTAN FOR LIFE GIVES US THE TIME WE NEED
trainval/7LcSdlVrg5M/50003 WE ARE ALMOST THERE
trainval/7LE4MoJS2po/50001 IF THAT ROBOT HAD FIGURED OUT THAT I WAS A PERSON NOT A CHAIR AND THAT I WAS WILLING TO GET OUT OF ITS WAY IF IT WAS
trainval/7LE4MoJS2po/50002 THEY DON'T GET CALLED ROBOT ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY SERVE A PURPOSE IN OUR LIVES
trainval/7LE4MoJS2po/50003 ITS GOAL IS TO MAKE MY HOUSE 66 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT AND IT SENSES THE WORLD
trainval/7LE4MoJS2po/50004 YOU'RE TALKING TOO SOFTLY I'M GOING TO TURN UP YOUR VOLUME WHICH IS LIKE HAVING A COWORKER WALK UP TO YOU AND SAY YOU'RE SPEAKING TOO SOFTLY
trainval/7LE4MoJS2po/50005 SO WHEN HE'D COME VISIT IN PERSON HE NO LONGER STOOD OVER ME AS HE WAS TALKING TO ME HE WOULD SIT DOWN AND TALK TO ME EYE TO
trainval/7LE4MoJS2po/50006 WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT ROBOTICS
trainval/7LE4MoJS2po/50007 HOW ARE DIFFERENT PEOPLE GOING TO GRAPPLE WITH THAT LOSS OF CONTROL
trainval/7LE4MoJS2po/50008 WE CAN'T TREAT HUMANS AS IF WE'RE JUST ONE MONOLITHIC THING
trainval/7LE4MoJS2po/50009 IT'S NOT SO MUCH ABOUT REINVENTING HUMANS IT'S MORE ABOUT FIGURING OUT HOW WE EXTEND OURSELVES RIGHT
trainval/7LPJrzZaoZg/50001 AND I REALIZED A LONG TIME AGO THAT IF I CHALLENGE PEOPLE TO BUILD THE EQUIPMENT THEY NEED OUT OF THE GARBAGE
trainval/7Mn4PnGRuPk/50001 BUT SOCIAL IS NOT AN APP
trainval/7Mn4PnGRuPk/50002 AND YOU SAID WHAT MESSAGE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
trainval/7Mqse6SLOds/50001 WE ALL ABSORB THESE SOCIAL NARRATIVES FROM AN EARLY AGE AND WE HARDLY EVER QUESTION THEM
trainval/7Mqse6SLOds/50002 BUT I DON'T WANT YOU AROUND IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE MISERABLE
trainval/7Mqse6SLOds/50003 THE FACT THAT OUR SOCIETY TRIES SO HARD TO HAVE IT BOTH WAYS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF A
trainval/7Mqse6SLOds/50004 THEN WE'LL TEST YOUR KIDS EVERY YEAR TO SEE HOW THEY'RE DOING
trainval/7Mqse6SLOds/50005 WHAT WE SHOULD BE SAYING AS A SOCIETY TO PARENTS WHO ARE CONSIDERING DIVORCE IS WE JUST DON'T KNOW
trainval/7n9IOH0NvyY/50001 I HAD TO START THINKING ABOUT THEM AND IT HAD BEEN PRIVILEGE THAT HAD KEPT IT INVISIBLE TO ME FOR SO LONG
trainval/7n9IOH0NvyY/50002 WHAT DO MEN HAVE TO DO WITH GENDER EQUALITY
trainval/7n9IOH0NvyY/50003 WHEN I SAY IT THEY GO WOW IS THAT INTERESTING
trainval/7n9IOH0NvyY/50004 GENDER EQUALITY IS ABOUT WOMEN RIGHT
trainval/7n9IOH0NvyY/50005 IT WAS A QUOTE FROM ONE OF THE MEN AND THE QUOTE WAS A BLACK WOMAN STOLE MY JOB
trainval/7n9IOH0NvyY/50006 ACTUALLY IT'S ABOUT ONE WORD IN THE TITLE
trainval/7n9IOH0NvyY/50007 I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE WORD MY
trainval/7n9IOH0NvyY/50008 OR A BLACK WOMAN GOT A JOB
trainval/7n9IOH0NvyY/50009 RESEARCH BY CATALYST AND OTHERS HAS SHOWN CONCLUSIVELY THAT THE MORE GENDER EQUAL
trainval/7n9IOH0NvyY/50010 THEY HAVE LOWER JOB TURNOVER
trainval/7n9IOH0NvyY/50011 THEY HAVE HIGHER RATES OF RETENTION HIGHER JOB SATISFACTION HIGHER RATES OF PRODUCTIVITY
trainval/7n9IOH0NvyY/50012 IT IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE
trainval/7n9IOH0NvyY/50013 WHEN I WAS A LOT YOUNGER THERE WAS A RIDDLE THAT WAS POSED TO US
trainval/7n9IOH0NvyY/50014 SOME OF YOU MAY WINCE TO REMEMBER THIS RIDDLE
trainval/7n9IOH0NvyY/50015 JUST LIKE THAT
trainval/7n9IOH0NvyY/50016 IF YOU LISTEN TO WHAT MEN SAY ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT IN THEIR LIVES GENDER
trainval/7n9IOH0NvyY/50017 IT TURNS OUT ACCORDING TO MOST STUDIES THAT THOSE COUNTRIES THAT ARE THE MOST
trainval/7n9IOH0NvyY/50018 THEY SMOKE LESS DRINK LESS TAKE RECREATIONAL DRUGS LESS OFTEN
trainval/7n9IOH0NvyY/50019 AND WHO WOULDN'T WANT THAT
trainval/7n9IOH0NvyY/50020 IT'S NOT A WIN LOSE
trainval/7n9IOH0NvyY/50021 IT IS A WIN WIN FOR EVERYONE
trainval/7nAU7KXXHEI/50001 THIS IS A FREE TOOL LENDING SERVICE
trainval/7npLVcymHGc/50001 AND I COULD RELATE AND I FELT STRONGLY ABOUT IT
trainval/7npLVcymHGc/50002 WHAT WAS THE POINT OF IT ALL
trainval/7npLVcymHGc/50003 WHAT SHOULD I DO NEXT
trainval/7npLVcymHGc/50004 LET ME ASK A QUESTION
trainval/7npLVcymHGc/50005 SO I DECIDED TO MAKE MPI THE WORLD'S FIRST OPEN SOURCE PHILOSOPHY
trainval/7npLVcymHGc/50006 I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU TO TELL HUMANITY WHAT YOU THINK
trainval/7npLVcymHGc/50007 PURSUING YOUR PASSION THAT TAKES COURAGE
trainval/7npLVcymHGc/50008 WELL MY THINKING WAS WELL SELF DISCOVERY SEEMS TO BE INFINITE
trainval/7npLVcymHGc/50009 IF WE ALL FELT STRONGLY ABOUT THE SAME THINGS WE'D ALL BE SOLVING THE SAME PROBLEMS AND IGNORING THE SAME PROBLEMS
trainval/7npLVcymHGc/50010 IF HUMANITY HELD A TEAM MEETING I WOULD SAY OK
trainval/7npLVcymHGc/50011 LET'S DO THIS
trainval/7npLVcymHGc/50012 NOW LET'S REALLY NAIL DOWN PASSION BECAUSE THE IDEA OF NOT EVEN BOTHERING TO SEARCH FOR IT IS STILL RINGING IN MY HEAD
trainval/7O7BMa9XGXE/50001 BUT MINE REALLY ARE
trainval/7O7BMa9XGXE/50002 I THINK WE AS GLORIA LADSON BILLINGS SAYS SHOULD FLIP OUR PARADIGM AND OUR
trainval/7Oe11XnBvA8/50002 IT WAS LIKE A MUD LIKE LAVA FLOW HAD SWEPT OVER THE LANDSCAPE IN THE MOST UNIMAGINABLE
trainval/7oQY0uC52jY/50001 THESE ARE THE FUTURE ANTHROPOMETRICS
trainval/7oQY0uC52jY/50002 SO WE COMBINED THESE NEEDS WITH TECHNOLOGY'S THEMES
trainval/7oQY0uC52jY/50003 THIS WILL BE VERY DIFFERENT IN THE FUTURE
trainval/7p4zw4SqgUw/50001 CULTURAL HISTORIAN NANCY CAMPBELL SAYS THAT WE TEND TO THINK OF THEM AS PROBLEM SOLVING DRUGS AND
trainval/7p4zw4SqgUw/50002 OR ACROSS THE COUNTRY 51 MILLION PEOPLE
trainval/7p4zw4SqgUw/50003 WHEN I TALK ABOUT DRUGS AND DESIRE PEOPLE MAKE TWO ASSUMPTIONS
trainval/7p4zw4SqgUw/50004 THE FIRST IS
trainval/7p4zw4SqgUw/50005 ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT IF 15 30 OF THE USERS OF PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS
trainval/7p4zw4SqgUw/50006 AND WHAT ARE THEY USING
trainval/7p4zw4SqgUw/50007 NOW SHE'S HAPPY SHE'S EXCELLING AT HER SCHOOL WORK AND SHE'S SOCIALLY ACTIVE
trainval/7p4zw4SqgUw/50008 SO WRITERS LIKE W
trainval/7p4zw4SqgUw/50009 WHEN PEOPLE COME AND TELL ME ABOUT THE PROPAGANDA THEY'VE HEARD ABOUT METHAMPHETAMINE PEOPLE WHO HAVE CLEARLY NEVER TRIED THE
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50001 SIMPLY BY HAPPY HAPPENSTANCE YOU'RE LIVING IN IRELAND
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50002 ABOUT HOW MUCH DID WE SPEND ON THE RIO OLYMPICS THIS YEAR
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50003 AROUND ABOUT 93 BILLION
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50004 ADD THEM ALL TOGETHER AND THIS IS ABOUT WHAT YOU GET
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50005 WHAT WE SPEND ON LOOKING AFTER PATIENTS WITH CANCER IN THE WORLD 170
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50006 IT'S CALLED THE 5 80 PARADOX
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50007 ONLY 5 OF THE RESOURCES THAT ARE GOING INTO ONCOLOGY ARE BEING SPENT IN THE PARTS OF THE
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50008 WHY DOES IT COST SO MUCH
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50009 WHERE IS ALL THIS MONEY GOING
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50010 WELL THE PHARMA COMPANIES WILL SAY MY SEXY DRUG WAS REALLY EXPENSIVE TO MAKE
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50011 AND THAT'S TRUE
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50012 6 BILLION TO MAKE
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50013 IT'S A LOT OF MONEY
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50014 SO THE MAGIC BULLET KILLS THE CANCER AND LEAVES YOU UNAFFECTED WITHOUT ANY SIDE EFFECTS BUT OF
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50015 WHAT ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE REST OF THE WORLD
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50016 OVERALL IT'S A RESOUNDINGLY GOOD SUCCESS STORY
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50017 THIS IS THE UNDER FIVE MORTALITY RATE
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50018 CANCER IS A DISEASE OF THE AGING
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50019 VERY OFTEN WE'RE DETECTING SOMETHING THAT A PATIENT CAN'T FEEL
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50020 SHE'S HAVING A MAMMOGRAM AND WE'RE DETECTING AN ASYMPTOMATIC CANCER AT A STAGE WE'RE ABLE TO CURE
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50021 BUT THIS IS HOW BREAST CANCER PRESENTS IN THE REST OF THE WORLD
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50022 HER BREAST IS ALSO REPLACED BY CANCER SHRUNKEN AND SMALL
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50023 TARGET THE GROUPS THAT NEED IT MOST
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50024 THE SEX WORKERS HEALTH WORKERS WHO ARE EXPOSED TO BLOOD PRODUCTS INTRAVENOUS DRUG ABUSERS
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50025 TARGET THEM EDUCATE THEM GIVE THEM THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO AVOID THE CANCERS TO GET VACCINATIONS
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50026 THERE ARE GREAT VACCINATIONS AVAILABLE FOR BOTH HEPATITIS B AND ALSO HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50027 WE'VE CHATTED ALREADY TODAY ABOUT HOW VERY DIFFICULT IT IS TO CHANGE BEHAVIORS
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50028 WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE APPROACHES AND CULTURES AROUND ALCOHOL YES BANNING SPORTS ADVERTISING FOR ALCOHOL
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50029 IT'LL BE VERY HARD TO STOP THEM FROM SMOKING IF THEY START IT AT 18 19 20
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50030 SMOKING IS LINKED TO MORE THAN 15 CANCERS AND SINGLE HANDEDLY CONTRIBUTES TO THE FORMATION
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50031 HELICOBACTER PYLORI IT'S A LITTLE BUG ENDEMIC IN SOME AREAS THAT CAUSES STOMACH CANCER
trainval/7POkIJfbMyU/50032 SO THESE ARE ESTIMATES OF THE IMPACT THESE PROGRAMS WILL HAVE BUT IF SUCCESSFUL AND IF THE HPV
trainval/7pVPmmwSeJQ/50001 IN THE LATE 1990S A COUPLE OF PROFESSORS PROPOSED A CONCEPT FOR RADICALLY REDUCING THE
trainval/7pVPmmwSeJQ/50002 GOVERNMENT HAD FOUND A POWERFUL OPTIMAL TRADEOFF THAT IN TAKING PICTURES AT RIGHT ABOUT ONE METER
trainval/7pVPmmwSeJQ/50003 WHY BUILD THESE SATELLITES
trainval/7PwvGfs6Pok/50001 NOW LET'S LOOK AT THE CONTINUUM IN OUR SOCIETY WHERE SEXUALITY IS MEASURED
trainval/7PwvGfs6Pok/50002 COM JUST USED ONE AD WITH A COUPLE IN A WHEELCHAIR ONE AD
trainval/7PwvGfs6Pok/50003 I'VE NEVER DATED SOMEONE ASIAN BEFORE
trainval/7PwvGfs6Pok/50004 HERE I AM ON MY THIRD DATE WITH MY WITTY RETORTS A DRESS THAT LEFT
trainval/7PwvGfs6Pok/50005 YOU SEE IF THERE'S CHEMISTRY
trainval/7PwvGfs6Pok/50006 ONE TIME I ASKED A CLIENT
trainval/7PwvGfs6Pok/50007 SO WHAT DO YOU FIND SEXY ABOUT YOURSELF
trainval/7rMYfiRNT7g/50001 RUGBY CRICKET HOCKEY
trainval/7rMYfiRNT7g/50002 BUT THIS TIME IT WASN'T TEMPORARY
trainval/7rMYfiRNT7g/50003 UNABLE TO TELL THE TIME UNABLE TO TELL IF IT WAS DAY OR NIGHT WHEN I WENT TO BED FOR FIVE MINUTES AND
trainval/7rMYfiRNT7g/50004 I'VE GOT PROBLEMS
trainval/7rMYfiRNT7g/50005 THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT
trainval/7rMYfiRNT7g/50006 HE'S AN EX BRITISH
trainval/7rMYfiRNT7g/50007 HE'S ACTUALLY EX ROYAL MARINES
trainval/7rMYfiRNT7g/50008 THEY DON'T LIKE TO BE CALLED ARMY
trainval/7rMYfiRNT7g/50009 HE WASN'T INTERESTED IN MY RESUME A BIG LIST
trainval/7rMYfiRNT7g/50010 BUT I WAS BUILDING UP TO THE BIG POINT
trainval/7rMYfiRNT7g/50011 TONY I'M BLIND
trainval/7rMYfiRNT7g/50012 AND I APPRECIATE IF YOU'VE GOT TO CHECK WITH YOUR HEALTH AND SAFETY PEOPLE TO ACCEPT MY ENTRY
trainval/7rMYfiRNT7g/50013 AND REMARKABLY SHE SAID YES
trainval/7rMYfiRNT7g/50014 AND I WAS SO SUPER CONFIDENT THAT I OF COURSE EXPECTED HER TO SAY YES
trainval/7rMYfiRNT7g/50015 BUT I ALSO LEARNED THAT I WAS GOING TO SUFFER FROM LACK OF BLADDER CONTROL BOWEL CONTROL SEXUAL
trainval/7rMYfiRNT7g/50016 I WOULD HAVE SPASMS NEUROPATHIC PAIN INFECTIONS
trainval/7rMYfiRNT7g/50017 MY LIFE EXPECTANCY WOULD BE REDUCED
trainval/7rMYfiRNT7g/50018 AND AS I BREAK THE DEVICE THEY REDESIGN IT AND RETROFIT ALL THE DEVICES AROUND THE WORLD
trainval/7rMYfiRNT7g/50019 IT'S EXCITING STUFF
trainval/7rMYfiRNT7g/50020 AND EARLIER THIS YEAR I SPENT THREE MONTHS IN UCLA WORKING WITH REGGIE AND YURY COMBINING MY
trainval/7rMYfiRNT7g/50021 IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THE FORMAL MEDICAL STRUCTURE HAS TURNED SPINAL INJURIES INTO A PREDICTABLE
trainval/7rMYfiRNT7g/50022 AND THAT'S WHY I'M EXCITED ABOUT IT BECAUSE THAT'S THE DOMAIN I LIVE IN
trainval/7rMYfiRNT7g/50023 THAT IS THEY KEEP US ALIVE THEY GET US INTO WHEELCHAIRS AND WE CAN GO AND LIVE LIFE
trainval/7rVK0VYPWHk/50001 AND THAT MADE ME REALIZED WAIT A MINUTE
trainval/7rVK0VYPWHk/50002 AND THAT BROUGHT ME BACK AGAIN TO MY CHILDHOOD
trainval/7s0CpRfyYp8/50001 BUT WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM
trainval/7s0CpRfyYp8/50002 WELL WHY WOULD I BOTHER DOING THAT
trainval/7s0CpRfyYp8/50003 1 SECOND IT BECOMES MORE TICKLISH
trainval/7s2CoqypMLg/50001 AND I CARE SO MUCH ABOUT THIS QUESTION THAT I WORK FOR A NONPROFIT CALLED RECODE
trainval/7s2CoqypMLg/50002 WE THINK THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED HERE IN THE US
trainval/7s2CoqypMLg/50003 THE OTHER HALF GOES RIGHT OUT THE OTHER SIDE
trainval/7s2CoqypMLg/50004 LET'S DESIGN TO MAKE IT BEAUTIFUL AS ADVANCED POTTY TRAINING
trainval/7s2CoqypMLg/50005 WILL THEY BE GAINFULLY EMPLOYED
trainval/7SfQLQ7eyA8/50001 PARKS ARE ONE OF THE TRUE DEMOCRATIC SPACES IN OUR CITIES
trainval/7SfQLQ7eyA8/50002 EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO GO TO A PARK
trainval/7SfQLQ7eyA8/50003 WHAT IF ONLY SMOKESTACKS AND CRANES FILL YOUR SKY
trainval/7SfQLQ7eyA8/50004 AND HELP US FEEL HAPPIER
trainval/7SfQLQ7eyA8/50005 DURING THAT TIME IN THE 70S AND 80S IT WAS CLAIMED TO HAVE ONE OF THE HIGHEST PER CAPITA MURDER RATES IN THE WORLD
trainval/7SfQLQ7eyA8/50006 OVER 500 POLICE OFFICERS WERE KILLED
trainval/7SfRgg9botI/50001 WHILE AT THE SAME TIME THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF TRANSPLANTS HAS REMAINED ALMOST ENTIRELY FLAT
trainval/7SfRgg9botI/50002 IT DISINTEGRATES A FEW MONTHS LATER
trainval/7SfRgg9botI/50003 IT'S ACTING ONLY AS A CELL DELIVERY VEHICLE
trainval/7SfRgg9botI/50004 BUT THEY ARE REALLY ACTING MOSTLY AS CONDUITS
trainval/7SfRgg9botI/50005 THEY ARE NOT NEARLY AS COMPLEX AS HOLLOW ORGANS
trainval/7SfRgg9botI/50006 WE CAN USE IT FROM ONE PATIENT TO THE NEXT
trainval/7SfRgg9botI/50007 AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT YOU'RE SEEING
trainval/7SfRgg9botI/50008 A WINDPIPE CELL ALREADY KNOWS IT'S A WINDPIPE CELL
trainval/7SfRgg9botI/50009 SO WE PREFER ORGAN SPECIFIC CELLS
trainval/7SfRgg9botI/50010 WE STARTED IMPLANTING SOME OF THESE STRUCTURES OVER 14 YEARS AGO
trainval/7shXEFuxHAA/50001 BUT THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED MAYBE MAYBE NOT
trainval/7shXEFuxHAA/50002 YOU HAVE NO TIME FOR PROJECTED IDEAS
trainval/7shXEFuxHAA/50003 SO IT'S UNPREDICTABLE
trainval/7shXEFuxHAA/50004 HE'LL PLAY IT
trainval/7shXEFuxHAA/50005 SO I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WE'RE GOING TO PLAY JUST FOR A SECOND
trainval/7shXEFuxHAA/50006 AND WE'RE GOING TO PLAY ON THIS PALETTE
trainval/7shXEFuxHAA/50007 IF I COME UP AND I DICTATE TO THE BAND THAT I WANT TO PLAY LIKE THIS AND I WANT THE MUSIC TO
trainval/7shXEFuxHAA/50008 AND AT SOME POINT CHRISTIAN WILL INTRODUCE THIS NOTE
trainval/7shXEFuxHAA/50009 IT HAS FAR MORE TO DO WITH WHAT I CAN PERCEIVE THAN WHAT IT IS THAT I CAN DO
trainval/7shXEFuxHAA/50010 WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU ENGAGE AND INSPIRE THE OTHER MUSICIANS AND THEY GIVE YOU MORE AND GRADUALLY IT BUILDS
trainval/7SjWguOXVwE/50001 WHY IS IT THAT WE SEEM TO ENJOY FEELING SAD WHEN WE ARE LISTENING TO MUSIC
trainval/7SjWguOXVwE/50002 WELL THAT WAS THE QUESTION THAT I SET OUT TO FIND THE ANSWER TO AND ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES WE'VE
trainval/7SjWguOXVwE/50003 AND WE'VE ALSO DONE EXPERIMENTS WHERE WE'VE ACTUALLY PLAYED SAD MUSIC TO PEOPLE AND THEN MEASURE THE EFFECTS ON
trainval/7SjWguOXVwE/50004 SO FOR PEOPLE WITH TENDENCIES TO DEPRESSION OFTEN NEGATIVE EMOTIONS ARE MORE EASILY TRIGGERED IN THEM
trainval/7SjWguOXVwE/50005 WE THEN PLAY THEM A PIECE OF SAD MUSIC AND THEIR DEPRESSION LEVELS REALLY
trainval/7SjWguOXVwE/50006 WHEN IT COMES TO MUSIC WE ACTUALLY SEEM TO ENJOY FEELING SAD
trainval/7SjWguOXVwE/50007 BUT IF YOU ALREADY AT THIS CLINICAL LEVELS OF MAJOR DEPRESSION AND THEN YOU MOOD GOES EVEN LOWER
trainval/7SjWguOXVwE/50008 WITH A THE GOOD THING ABOUT MUSIC IS IT CAN HELP YOU TO REALLY FEEL YOUR EMOTIONS TO REALLY
trainval/7sqeoYOQ4qg/50001 BY THE TIME KIDS ARE 13 OR 14 THEY TEND TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOLS
trainval/7sqeoYOQ4qg/50002 I'VE TRIED A NUMBER OF THINGS AND NOTHING SEEMS TO WORK
trainval/7sqeoYOQ4qg/50003 CAN YOU POSSIBLY HELP
trainval/7sqeoYOQ4qg/50004 AS MY COLLEAGUES AND I LOOKED ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND ACROSS THE WORLD WE COULDN'T FIND ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT
trainval/7sqeoYOQ4qg/50005 BECAUSE IT REALLY ALLOWED US TO TAKE ALL THOSE IDEAS WHICH WERE BEING THROWN AT US AND SAY WHICH ONES WE WERE GOING TO
trainval/7sqeoYOQ4qg/50006 DOES THIS IDEA SUPPORT THIS GOAL
trainval/7sqeoYOQ4qg/50007 HAS THE TOILET BEEN MADE HAS THE MEAL BEEN SERVED
trainval/7sqeoYOQ4qg/50008 BUT WHAT WAS ALSO INTERESTING WAS THAT NONE OF THEM ACTUALLY SCALED
trainval/7sqeoYOQ4qg/50009 ALL OF THEM WERE LIMITED TO 50 100 OR 500 SCHOOLS
trainval/7sqeoYOQ4qg/50010 AND EVEN FOR ME WHO'S LIVED IN INDIA ALL HER LIFE WALKING INTO ONE OF THESE SCHOOLS IS FAIRLY
trainval/7sqeoYOQ4qg/50011 IN THE END I THINK WE DID FIND SOLUTIONS TO MANY OF THE ISSUES
trainval/7sqeoYOQ4qg/50012 THE DEPARTMENT USED TO HAVE A PROCESS WHICH IS VERY INTERESTING
trainval/7sqeoYOQ4qg/50013 BUT NOW IMAGINE THAT THE HEAD OF THIS NGO GOES TO THE HEAD OF THE SCHOOL EDUCATION DEPARTMENT AND SAYS HEY NOW
trainval/7SrGFfZMJ6Q/50001 AND BY THE WAY WHO IN HIS RIGHT MIND WOULD ARGUE AGAINST LOVE OF LEARNING
trainval/7SRGn75JcZ8/50001 I CONTINUED TO DRINK MY WAY THROUGH COLLEGE
trainval/7SRGn75JcZ8/50002 AND YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TELL THAT IF YOU MET ME
trainval/7SRGn75JcZ8/50003 RIGHT NOW WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF ONE OF THE GREATEST HEALTH CRISES OF OUR TIME
trainval/7SRGn75JcZ8/50004 DURING 2014 ALONE 28000 PEOPLE DIED OF DRUG OVERDOSES
trainval/7SRGn75JcZ8/50005 SOME WOULDN'T EVEN UTTER THE WORDS
trainval/7SRGn75JcZ8/50006 SOME CALLED IT THE GAY PLAGUE
trainval/7SRGn75JcZ8/50007 THIS WAS AN EFFORT STARTED BY CLEVE JONES IN SAN FRANCISCO TO SHOW THAT PEOPLE WHO DIED OF AIDS HAD
trainval/7SRGn75JcZ8/50008 THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION TO STRIKE DOWN THE BAN ON SAME SEX MARRIAGE
trainval/7SRGn75JcZ8/50009 AT ONE POINT A CONGRESSIONAL STAFFER SAID THAT THERE WAS NO WAY THAT I WAS GOING TO BE CONFIRMED BY THE UNITED STATES SENATE
trainval/7SRGn75JcZ8/50010 IT'S WHISPERED ABOUT
trainval/7SRGn75JcZ8/50011 GENERALLY PEOPLE WITH OTHER DISEASES GET CARE AND TREATMENT
trainval/7SRGn75JcZ8/50012 IF YOU HAVE CANCER YOU GET TREATMENT IF YOU HAVE DIABETES YOU GET TREATMENT
trainval/7SRGn75JcZ8/50013 FOR TOO LONG OUR COUNTRY FELT LIKE WE COULD ARREST OUR WAY OUT OF THIS PROBLEM
trainval/7SRGn75JcZ8/50014 BUT WE KNOW THAT WE CAN'T
trainval/7SRGn75JcZ8/50015 WE'VE DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO EXPAND PREVENTION SERVICES TREATMENT
trainval/7SRGn75JcZ8/50016 TOGETHER WE CAN CHANGE PUBLIC POLICY
trainval/7SRGn75JcZ8/50017 WE SEE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OTHER FIRST RESPONDERS REVERSING OVERDOSES WITH NALOXONE TO GIVE
trainval/7sxpKhIbr0E/50001 I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT THE RESEARCH SAYS ABOUT HOW TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN
trainval/7sxpKhIbr0E/50002 REALLY IT'S ALL IN HOW YOU SEE IT
trainval/7sxpKhIbr0E/50003 IT'S YOUR PARADIGM
trainval/7sxpKhIbr0E/50004 IT'S CALLED THE COOKIE THIEF BY VALERIE COX
trainval/7sxpKhIbr0E/50005 NOW THE MANAGEMENT DEFINITION OF EMPOWERMENT IS GET IT DONE
trainval/7sxpKhIbr0E/50007 I MEAN TRAINING IS TO WATCH THE BEHAVIOR BUT ONLINE TRAINING IS LIKE PLASTIC SILVERWARE
trainval/7sxpKhIbr0E/50008 SO WE'VE HAD A TRAINING QUESTION WE'VE HAD AN EDUCATIONAL QUESTION THIS IS THE MOTIVATIONAL QUESTION
trainval/7sxpKhIbr0E/50009 SKINNER AND SAID THAT FROM THE DAY YOU WERE BORN EVERYTHING YOU DID WAS BECAUSE YOU WANTED SOMETHING FOR DOING IT
trainval/7sxpKhIbr0E/50010 HOW DO YOU INSPIRE PEOPLE TO FEEL COMPETENT
trainval/7sxpKhIbr0E/50011 WELL YOU GIVE THEM FEEDBACK
trainval/7sxpKhIbr0E/50012 SKINNER TAUGHT US THAT TOO IN HIS BOOK BEYOND FREEDOM AND DIGNITY WAY BACK IN 1971
trainval/7sxpKhIbr0E/50013 HOW ARE THE DRUMS
trainval/7sxpKhIbr0E/50014 HOW DID YOU LEARN TO DO THAT
trainval/7sxpKhIbr0E/50015 TEACH THEM ABOUT CONSEQUENCES DRIVE US
trainval/7sxpKhIbr0E/50016 NICE GUYS FINISH LAST
trainval/7sxpKhIbr0E/50017 I DIDN'T HAVE A NICE DRUM LIKE THIS
trainval/7sxpKhIbr0E/50018 MY PARENTS BOUGHT ME A BEATABLE DRUM AT AN AUCTION
trainval/7tu9nJmr4Xs/50001 I HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE
trainval/7tu9nJmr4Xs/50002 NOW THIS WAS A HUGE DEAL RIGHT
trainval/7tu9nJmr4Xs/50003 SO I STARTED BY BLAMING EVERYBODY
trainval/7TXEZ4tP06c/50001 ALL WE'RE DOING IS LITTLE VARIATIONS
trainval/7TXEZ4tP06c/50002 ONE IS HAVE AN OPEN MIND
trainval/7TXEZ4tP06c/50003 ARE YOU UP FOR THAT
trainval/7TXEZ4tP06c/50004 SO I SAID I WOULD AND I BOOKED THE TIME IN
trainval/7TXEZ4tP06c/50005 HAVE YOU EVER DONE THAT
trainval/7TXEZ4tP06c/50006 I THOUGHT WHAT COULD I DO WITH THEM
trainval/7TXEZ4tP06c/50007 I'LL DO MY CARTOON DRAWING
trainval/7TXEZ4tP06c/50009 YOU CAN JUST SEE THE DELIGHT ON THEIR FACES CAN'T YOU
trainval/7TXEZ4tP06c/50010 THEY JUST GOT ON WITH IT
trainval/7TXEZ4tP06c/50011 IT WAS AN INSPIRATIONAL SESSION FOR ME
trainval/7TXEZ4tP06c/50012 AT THE END OF IT I HAD A LOVELY EMAIL FROM DOCTOR MIKE JORDAN AND HE'S THE CHAIR OF THE TALK GROUP
trainval/7TXEZ4tP06c/50013 YOU'RE VERY WELCOME TO TAKE THE PENS WITH YOU AND HAVE A PRACTICE AT HOME EVEN SHOW SOMEBODY ELSE
trainval/7TXEZ4tP06c/50014 IF WE DID CHALLENGE THOSE BELIEFS AND THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THEM APART FROM DRAWING WHAT ELSE WOULD BE
trainval/7VRzn8hc5mc/50001 MY DISLIKE OF WORDS MADE ME EXCEL IN THE BETTER SUBJECTS SUCH AS PHYSICS MATHEMATICS AND
trainval/7VRzn8hc5mc/50002 BUT ONE DAY I HAD TO CRY
trainval/7VRzn8hc5mc/50003 DID YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF TEARS
trainval/7VRzn8hc5mc/50004 IT REACTS BOTH TO POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EMOTIONS LIKE SADNESS HAPPINESS PLEASURE OR
trainval/7vsO7SHLJMI/50001 IT CAN MAKE EVERYTHING FLOW
trainval/7vsO7SHLJMI/50002 WHEN EVERYONE THINKS THAT WHATEVER IS HAPPENING IS JUST HAPPENING NATURALLY
trainval/7vsO7SHLJMI/50003 IT WAS IN THE EARLY 1990S
trainval/7vsO7SHLJMI/50004 WE'RE NOW LIVING IN A MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY THE LIKES OF WHICH THIS NATION HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE
trainval/7vsO7SHLJMI/50005 RIGHT NOW TODAY THERE ARE OVER 70 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SPOKEN IN
trainval/7vsO7SHLJMI/50006 IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN YOU TRAVEL TO ANOTHER COUNTRY TO KNOW ABOUT THE CUSTOMS THE CULTURES AND THE PROTOCOLS
trainval/7vsO7SHLJMI/50007 MANY NATIONS HAVE A PROTOCOL FOR EXCHANGING BUSINESS CARDS
trainval/7vsO7SHLJMI/50008 BUT JUST AS OUR LEADERS ARE GOING TO OTHER COUNTRIES OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE PEOPLE HERE
trainval/7vsO7SHLJMI/50009 THEY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT OUR SUCCESS STORIES THEY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT OUR CULTURE THEY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT OUR
trainval/7vsO7SHLJMI/50010 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEARLY HALF A CENTURY THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND BEGAN TO FEEL A DISCONNECT WITH
trainval/7vsO7SHLJMI/50011 SHE LOWERED IT WHEN THE QUEEN MOTHER DIED
trainval/7vsO7SHLJMI/50012 SHE LOWERED IT WHEN 9 11 HAPPENED
trainval/7vsO7SHLJMI/50013 SHE LOWERED IT WHEN THE LONDON SUBWAYS WERE BOMBED IN 2005
trainval/7vsO7SHLJMI/50014 THAT'S ONLY TRUE MOST OF THE TIME
trainval/7vsO7SHLJMI/50015 I'VE ALSO BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE INVOLVED IN TRADE MISSIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN ME TO COUNTRIES VIRTUALLY ALL OVER THE WORLD
trainval/7vsO7SHLJMI/50016 AS I'VE SAID KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON
trainval/7vsO7SHLJMI/50017 BECAUSE THE TIMES DEMANDED THAT THAT THEY NEEDED TO CHANGE
trainval/7vsO7SHLJMI/50018 IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS TIME TO TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR PROTOCOLS BECAUSE THE PROTOCOLS THAT HAD BEEN IN PLACE
trainval/7W8OJgeYy1w/50001 NOW MACHINES HAVE THE ABILITY TO STORE AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF
trainval/7wJTgUCxnKA/50001 THEY ARE ALL SITTING THERE
trainval/7XFLTDQ4JMk/50001 CAN PEOPLE SHIFT BACK AND FORTH OR DO THEY GET STUCK IN ONE WAY OF THINKING ABOUT IT
trainval/7XFLTDQ4JMk/50002 WE TEND TO THINK RIGHT THAT MISERY LOVES COMPANY THAT VENTING WILL HELP GET RID OF OUR NEGATIVE EMOTIONS
trainval/7XFLTDQ4JMk/50003 WE CAN BE MORE AWARE THAT BAD TENDS TO STICK
trainval/7Xmr87nsl74/50001 THIS IS THE BLUE BAR WHICH IS DRIVING COSTS DOWN
trainval/7Xmr87nsl74/50003 PEOPLE WERE STUNNED BY THE RESULTS
trainval/7Xmr87nsl74/50004 YOU KNOW POLAND HASN'T CHANGED ITS CULTURE
trainval/7Xmr87nsl74/50005 IT CHANGED ITS EDUCATION POLICIES AND PRACTICE
trainval/7Xmr87nsl74/50006 EVERYBODY SAYS THAT
trainval/7Xmr87nsl74/50007 HOW DO THE MEDIA TALK ABOUT SCHOOLS AND TEACHERS
trainval/7Xmr87nsl74/50008 YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT BUT THERE ARE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO BE IS NOT THE SHOPPING CENTER BUT THE
trainval/7Xmr87nsl74/50009 EVERY STUDENT KNOWS WHAT MATTERS
trainval/7Xmr87nsl74/50010 AND THE MOST IMPRESSIVE OUTCOMES OF WORLD CLASS SYSTEMS IS THAT THEY ACHIEVE HIGH PERFORMANCE ACROSS THE ENTIRE SYSTEM
trainval/7Xmr87nsl74/50011 IF WE CAN HELP EVERY CHILD EVERY TEACHER EVERY SCHOOL EVERY PRINCIPAL EVERY
trainval/7Xnty9zSCrA/50001 WE JUDGE PEOPLE BECAUSE OF JEALOUSY WHEN WE SE SOMEONE WE AUTOMATICALLY JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THEM
trainval/7Xnty9zSCrA/50002 HAVE YOU EVER HEARD THE SAYING DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER
trainval/7Xnty9zSCrA/50003 WELL THAT'S ALWAYS TRUE
trainval/7Xnty9zSCrA/50004 JUST BY SAYING SOMETHING LIKE YOU'RE FAT' OR NOBODY LIKES YOU' CAN CAUSE PEOPLE TO THINKING DOWN ON THEMSELVES
trainval/7Xnty9zSCrA/50005 THEN THE WHOLE THIRD GRADE FOUND OUT AND IT MADE ME FEEL DOWN ON MYSELF AND NOT WANT
trainval/7Y9W1Gex660/50001 THERE IS NO STORY LINE NO SCRIPT NO DRAMA NO CLIMAX AND IT'S CALLED SLOW
trainval/7Y9W1Gex660/50002 SO HE SAID WHY DON'T WE MAKE A RADIO PROGRAM MARKING THE DAY OF THE GERMAN INVASION OF NORWAY IN
trainval/7Y9W1Gex660/50003 SO WE CALLED OUR COMMISSIONING EDITORS IN OSLO AND WE SAID WE WANT TO MAKE A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THE BERGEN RAILWAY
trainval/7Y9W1Gex660/50004 NOT MUCH DRAMA
trainval/7Y9W1Gex660/50005 SO WE DECIDED OUR NEXT PROJECT IT SHOULD BE LIVE
trainval/7Y9W1Gex660/50006 THIS IS SO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TO OTHER TV PROGRAMMING
trainval/7Y9W1Gex660/50007 IT'S LIKE A SPORTS EVENT
trainval/7Y9W1Gex660/50008 YOU RIG THEM AND YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING
trainval/7Z9xCX4ifJo/50001 SO WHAT OR WHO IS A HACKER
trainval/7Z9xCX4ifJo/50002 WHAT IT SHOWS YOU IS THAT ANYBODY CAN BE A HACKER
trainval/7Z9xCX4ifJo/50003 A HACKER IS SOMEBODY WHO SEES A PROBLEM WHO HAS AN OBSTACLE THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO OVERCOME WHO LIKES TO TAKE
trainval/7Z9xCX4ifJo/50004 SO TRYING TO PAVE MY WAY AWAY FROM MYSELF AS A LIBRARIAN TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO OUTREACH TO STUDENTS AND TO
trainval/7Z9xCX4ifJo/50005 I ALSO TALKED TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN TO HACKATHONS
trainval/7Z9xCX4ifJo/50006 FROM ALL THE INFORMATION THAT I GATHERED I ORGANIZED MY FIRST HACKATHON IN 2013 THEMED OPEN YORK DATA
trainval/7Z9xCX4ifJo/50007 AND THEY WERE STARTING TO GET HACKATHON MANIA
trainval/7Z9xCX4ifJo/50008 THERE WERE STILL JUDGES AND MENTORS TO HELP THEM CRITICALLY EVALUATE THEIR OUTCOMES
trainval/7Z9xCX4ifJo/50009 AND THERE WERE ACTUALLY VENTURE CAPITALISTS TO HELP TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY PROJECTS TO
trainval/7Z9xCX4ifJo/50010 SO AT CENTENNIAL COLLEGE WHERE I CURRENTLY WORK I WORKED WITH THE APPLIED RESEARCH AND INNOVATION CENTER TO ORGANIZE A
trainval/7Z9xCX4ifJo/50011 THEY HAD TO THINK OF CONCEPTS AND IDEAS THEY HAD TO THINK OF DESIGN ISSUES AND THEY ALSO HAD TO THINK OF BUSINESS ASPECTS
trainval/7Z9xCX4ifJo/50012 THEY WERE TRYING TO BUILD AN APP TO HELP STUDENTS FIND THEIR WAY AROUND CAMPUS
trainval/7Z9xCX4ifJo/50013 WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN UNDERGROUND PATHWAY THAT I CONSIDER A MAZE I HAVE NEVER BEEN DOWN THERE
trainval/7Z9xCX4ifJo/50014 SO THAT WAY PEOPLE LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS TO READ A RESEARCH ARTICLE
trainval/7Z9xCX4ifJo/50015 THE PERSON WHO CAME UP WITH THIS APP TIMEIFY FELT THAT THE AD WAS EXCLUSIVE IT WAS ONLY MEANT FOR THOSE CERTAIN
trainval/7Z9xCX4ifJo/50016 HE WANTED TO CHANGE THAT
trainval/7Z9xCX4ifJo/50017 AND YES JOIN A HACKATHON
trainval/7ZoOyNTyjQE/50001 HOW DID IT HAPPEN
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50001 WE COULDN'T IMAGINE THAT ANYTHING SERIOUS COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50002 ACTUALLY NOTHING SERIOUS DID GO WRONG WITH HIS SURGERY
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50003 HOW COULD 12 HOURS AGO MY DAD BE PERFECTLY HEALTHY AND DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50004 BUT AFTER I HEARD HIS SYMPTOMS I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50005 I DROPPED EVERYTHING
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50006 I HAD TO RUSH HOME
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50007 I HAD TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL TO BE WITH HIM AND TO TALK WITH HIS DOCTORS
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50008 IT FELT LIKE I COULDN'T GET THERE FAST ENOUGH
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50009 THEN I HAD TO BATTLE BAY AREA TRAFFIC FOR OVER TWO HOURS
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50010 THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU WATCH MOVIES LIKE CONTAGION OR OUTBREAK
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50011 I WAS CERTAIN THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE GONE BY THE TIME I GOT TO THE HOSPITAL
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50012 I SAT THERE FOR A WEEK WITH MY DAD AND I CAN REMEMBER OBSESSIVELY WATCHING HIS VITALS MONITORS
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50013 IF WE REALLY HAD SUCH GREAT SUCCESS WITH THE EARLY GENERATION ANTIBIOTICS HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50014 IF YOU HAVE A MOUSE IN YOUR HOUSE YOU SET TRAPS TO TRY TO KILL THAT MOUSE
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50015 HOW DO WE FIGHT INFECTIONS
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50016 AS A RESULT WE DECLARED A WAR AGAINST INFECTIOUS DISEASES
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50017 WE PUT ALL OUR EFFORTS INTO DEVELOPING WEAPONS IN THE FORM OF ANTIBIOTICS AND ANTIVIRALS
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50018 BUT BACTERIA AND VIRUSES ARE INCREDIBLY SLIPPERY TARGETS
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50019 SO WHAT DO WE DO
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50020 THEY FREAKED YOU OUT RIGHT
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50021 IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT THE MICROBES HAVE EVOLVED RESISTANCE TO OUR NEW WEAPONS
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50022 THE SCARY FACT IS IT'S AN ARMS RACE WE CAN NEVER WIN
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50023 BUT THAT COMBAT DOES NOT OCCUR IN ISOLATION
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50024 SOMETHING THAT CAN HAPPEN IS WHAT'S CALLED THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE OF WAR WHICH IS THE UNINTENTIONAL OR
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50025 BUT THAT FIGHT IS NOT OCCURRING IN ISOLATION
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50026 WE ALL KNOW THAT OUR BODIES HAVE AN IMMUNE SYSTEM AND THIS IMMUNE SYSTEM IS IMPORTANT FOR RECOGNIZING
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50027 IT PROTECTS US FROM MORTALITY BY PREVENTING AND FIXING THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE THAT
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50028 WE TAKE A VARIETY OF APPROACHES TO ADDRESS THIS GOAL BUT ONE OF OUR MAIN APPROACHES THAT WE'RE REALLY EXCITED
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50029 RIGHT NOW ALL OF YOU HAVE ABOUT THREE POUNDS OF BACTERIA THAT ARE LIVING ON YOU BODY SURFACES
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50030 YOUR MICROBIOME IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR YOUR HEALTH
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50031 WE ARE USING THE MICROBIOME TO TEACH US HOW TO TURN TOLERANCE DEFENSES ON TO TEACH US WHAT THEY
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50032 I THINK THAT'S AMAZING
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50033 WE ARE ALL TERRIFIED OF THAT THREAT
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50034 BUT IF YOU LEAVE HERE WITH ONE THING TODAY I WANT YOU TO LEAVE HERE BELIEVING THAT THERE IS HOPE TO GET US OUT OF
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50035 THE FIRST STEP TO THIS IS REALLY CHANGING OUR PERSPECTIVE GOING FROM HOW DO WE FIGHT
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50036 WE HAVE TO MAKE THAT SHIFT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY THEN WHEN WE'LL TRULY BE ABLE TO CLOSE THE
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50037 SO IF WE'VE BEEN ASKING THE WRONG QUESTION WHAT IS THE QUESTION THAT WE SHOULD BE ASKING
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50038 INSTEAD OF ASKING HOW DO WE FIGHT INFECTIONS
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50039 WE SHOULD BE ASKING HOW DO WE SURVIVE INFECTIONS
trainval/7ZWTG0SeCEg/50040 I KNOW THAT A SINGLE WORD CHANGE FROM FIGHT TO SURVIVE SEEMS SIMPLE BUT BY MAKING THE SINGLE
trainval/80GqbW1MmQM/50001 THEY SAID WE'VE GOT OUR HANDS FULL WITH INFECTIOUS DISEASES
trainval/80GqbW1MmQM/50002 AND SHE CAME UP WITH WHAT SHE REFERRED TO WHEN TALKING TO ME AS HER THREE POINT PROGRAM
trainval/80GqbW1MmQM/50003 I WOULD INVITE THEM INTO MY HUT AND FILL IT WITH STEAM AND WITHIN MINUTES THEY WERE HOLDING OUT THEIR HANDS
trainval/80GqbW1MmQM/50004 AMERICA NEEDS MY ATTENTION NOW
trainval/80GqbW1MmQM/50005 I'D SAID TO HIM THAT I WANTED TO GET ONE OF THOSE THOSE FUR HATS LIKE THE ONES KARZAI WORE
trainval/80GqbW1MmQM/50006 JUST AFTER THE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER THE SOUTH AFRICAN ARTIST WILLIAM KENTRIDGE WITH WHOM I'D SPENT A LOT OF TIME
trainval/80GqbW1MmQM/50007 WE MUST TAKE ACTION AS CITIZENS OF OUR COUNTRIES YET EMBRACE THE LARGER
trainval/80USSKwX0iU/50001 I HAD TO START DOING SOMETHING THAT WAS CREATING A MORE POSITIVE LIFE FOR MY SON AND FOR
trainval/80USSKwX0iU/50002 1 BILLION PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY
trainval/855Now8h5Rs/50001 BUT AGAIN THE KEY IS WHEN PUT TO THE TEST THESE LEARNING STYLES DON'T EXIST IT DOESN'T MAKE A
trainval/855Now8h5Rs/50002 I WILL SAY THAT WHEN WE SURVEY PEOPLE MANY PEOPLE SAY THEY HAVE PREFERENCES
trainval/855Now8h5Rs/50003 SO IF I ASKED HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO LEARN SOMETHING
trainval/855Now8h5Rs/50004 OR HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO STUDY
trainval/855Now8h5Rs/50005 MANY OF YOU MIGHT SAY I'D PREFER TO SEE IT OR I'D PREFER TO HEAR IT OR I'D PREFER TO ACTUALLY DO IT
trainval/855Now8h5Rs/50006 MOSTLY WHAT YOU LEARN IN THE CLASSROOM IS MUCH MORE CONCEPTUAL OR MEANING BASED
trainval/855Now8h5Rs/50007 WE HAVE TO MAKE CONNECTIONS TO IT CONNECTING IT TO OUR EXPERIENCES OR COMING UP WITH OUR OWN EXAMPLES OR THINKING
trainval/855Now8h5Rs/50008 IN OTHER WORDS THIS GAME BOARD WAS MORE MEANINGFUL TO THEM
trainval/855Now8h5Rs/50009 THEY COULD SEE THE STRATEGY INVOLVED
trainval/855Now8h5Rs/50010 AND AS ABSURD AS THAT SOUNDS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THE SAME PROBLEMS THE SAME CRITICISMS
trainval/855Now8h5Rs/50011 AND THIS BASIC FINDING BY THE WAY HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO OTHER CONTEXTS EVERYTHING FROM CHESS TO BASKETBALL TO
trainval/855Now8h5Rs/50012 BUT BY SAYING THAT LEARNING STYLES DON'T EXIST I'M NOT SAYING PEOPLE ARE THE SAME
trainval/855Now8h5Rs/50013 LEARNING STYLES JUST ISN'T ONE OF THEM
trainval/855Now8h5Rs/50014 PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO BE RIGHT TO BE WRONG I SHOULD SAY
trainval/855Now8h5Rs/50015 MORE OFTEN THAN NOT WE TRY TO PROVE OURSELVES RIGHT
trainval/855Now8h5Rs/50016 WE LOOK FOR EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT WHATEVER IT IS WE THINK
trainval/855Now8h5Rs/50017 MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THIS IS UNINTENTIONAL
trainval/855Now8h5Rs/50018 THIS IS SUBCONSCIOUS
trainval/855Now8h5Rs/50019 WE NOTICE EVERY TIME WE'RE THINKING OF SOMEONE AND THEY CALL US BECAUSE IT'S A COOL COINCIDENCE IT'S KIND OF EXCITING
trainval/855Now8h5Rs/50020 WE NOTICE WHEN WE HAVE THAT MOMENT OF D J VU
trainval/855Now8h5Rs/50021 WE DON'T NOTICE ALL THE TIMES THAT WE'RE THINKING OF SOMEONE AND THEY DON'T CALL US
trainval/855Now8h5Rs/50022 OR WE DON'T REALLY THINK ABOUT ALL THE DREAMS WE'VE HAD THAT DON'T COME TRUE
trainval/855Now8h5Rs/50023 THAT'S NOT EASY
trainval/855Now8h5Rs/50024 THE FACT THAT LEARNING STYLES DON'T MATTER TO SOME EXTENT SHOULD BE A RELIEF BECAUSE IT'S ONE LESS THING TEACHERS HAVE TO
trainval/855Now8h5Rs/50025 BUT AT THE VERY LEAST WE CAN'T AFFORD TO BE WASTING OUR TIME AND RESOURCES TRYING TO PROMOTE LEARNING
trainval/855Now8h5Rs/50026 BUT AGAIN IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE WILLING TO LET OUR GUARD DOWN SOMETIMES AND CHALLENGE OUR BELIEFS AND
trainval/855Now8h5Rs/50027 THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT LEARNING STYLES DON'T EXIST IN MANY WAYS SHOULD BE FURTHER GOOD NEWS BECAUSE IT MEANS ALL OF US ARE
trainval/85bqT904VWA/50001 SPENCER'S FORM WAS NOT ONLY GENIUS IN ITS APPEARANCE BUT IT WAS A THING OF BRILLIANCE IN
trainval/85bqT904VWA/50002 THERE WERE OTHERS THAT FOLLOWED IN SPENCER'S PEN STROKES
trainval/85bqT904VWA/50003 OF COURSE I PRACTICED MY ARTWORK AND MY HANDWRITING INCESSANTLY SO MUCH SO THAT I GAINED A
trainval/85bqT904VWA/50004 MAY WE ALWAYS KEEP IT EVER CLOSE TO OUR HEARTS
trainval/85hbMtegrLc/50001 WE HAVE AN AFTER SCHOOL MENTORING PROGRAM AND WE CREATE A PEACE CLUB
trainval/85hbMtegrLc/50002 AT MY UNDERSTANDING THAT MY GRANDSON WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER OF THIS HUMAN BEING I WENT TO THE PRAYER CLOSET LIKE I WAS
trainval/85hbMtegrLc/50003 THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE IN THE TARIQ KHAMISA FOUNDATION PROVIDE SO MANY TOOLS FOR THE KIDS TO PUT IN THEIR TOOLKIT
trainval/85hbMtegrLc/50004 WHEN I WAS 14 I MURDERED MR
trainval/85hbMtegrLc/50005 I CALL THIS MY PEACE FORMULA
trainval/85hbMtegrLc/50006 AS IT'S EVIDENT IT WORKED FOR ME
trainval/86Hyq4bBpA0/50001 CANCER DOESN'T CARE WHERE WE WORK
trainval/86xSuStz0MA/50001 AREN'T YOU AFRAID YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP WRITING FOR YOUR WHOLE LIFE AND YOU'RE NEVER AGAIN GOING TO CREATE A BOOK THAT ANYBODY
trainval/86xSuStz0MA/50002 AREN'T YOU AFRAID THE HUMILIATION OF REJECTION WILL KILL YOU
trainval/86xSuStz0MA/50003 AREN'T YOU AFRAID THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WORK YOUR WHOLE LIFE AT THIS CRAFT AND NOTHING'S EVER GOING TO COME OF IT AND YOU'RE GOING TO DIE ON A SCRAP
trainval/86xSuStz0MA/50004 AND I ALWAYS HAVE BEEN
trainval/86xSuStz0MA/50005 I STILL HAVE MAYBE ANOTHER FOUR DECADES OF WORK LEFT IN ME
trainval/86xSuStz0MA/50006 AND IT WOULD COME BARRELING DOWN AT HER OVER THE LANDSCAPE
trainval/86xSuStz0MA/50007 AND I WOULD IMAGINE THAT A LOT OF YOU HAVE TOO
trainval/86xSuStz0MA/50008 OTHERWISE GO BOTHER SOMEBODY ELSE TODAY
trainval/86xSuStz0MA/50009 WHEN I HEARD THAT STORY IT STARTED TO SHIFT A LITTLE BIT THE WAY THAT I WORKED TOO AND THIS IDEA ALREADY SAVED ME ONCE
trainval/86xSuStz0MA/50010 BUT THEN I REMEMBERED TOM TALKING TO THE OPEN AIR AND I TRIED IT
trainval/86xSuStz0MA/50011 WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE WE NEED THAT
trainval/86xSuStz0MA/50012 TO YOU NONETHELESS
trainval/87vO1XhHuHI/50001 BEFORE ANY FORMAL INSTRUCTION BEGAN ALEXIS SAID WOW
trainval/87vO1XhHuHI/50002 WE ARE CONNECTING THEM TO THE ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH TECHNOLOGY
trainval/88SlA2EZxtY/50001 AND THE LAW IS SET MANY TIMES BECAUSE OF THE FIGHTS OF VERY COURAGEOUS WOMEN AND SOME
trainval/88SlA2EZxtY/50004 WOMEN ARE SAID TO BE MUCH MORE EMOTIONAL THAN MEN AND BY THE WAY IN THE CONTEXT OF COMPANY
trainval/88SlA2EZxtY/50005 WOMEN ARE SAID TO HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE OF DIRECTION
trainval/88SlA2EZxtY/50006 AND YET THERE IS ANOTHER SENSE OF SPACE THAT WOMEN DO HAVE AND MEN DON'T
trainval/88SlA2EZxtY/50007 AND THAT'S THE SENSE OF DETAIL IN A SMALLER SPACE
trainval/88SlA2EZxtY/50008 SENSE OF DIRECTION
trainval/88SlA2EZxtY/50009 AND EVEN IF SHE MANAGES TO HAVE BOTH AT THE SAME TIME SHE MIGHT NOT GET THE
trainval/88SlA2EZxtY/50010 THEY KNOW TIME RUNS FAST
trainval/88SlA2EZxtY/50011 AND THEY'RE LESS POLITICAL MAYBE BECAUSE THEIR LIFE DOESN'T REVOLVE AROUND THEIR CAREER ONLY
trainval/88SlA2EZxtY/50012 THAT'S USUALLY WHAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT
trainval/88SlA2EZxtY/50013 EQUAL BUT DIFFERENT
trainval/88SlA2EZxtY/50014 EQUAL AND COMPLEMENTARY
trainval/88SlA2EZxtY/50015 I WOULD NEVER AGREE TO THE IDEA OF A PREDETERMINATION OF FUNCTION BASED ON
trainval/89Dhye1lgik/50001 AND HIS NAME IS KENDRICK LAMAR
trainval/89Dhye1lgik/50002 LET US COME BACK TO N
trainval/89Dhye1lgik/50003 I'M THE MOST MYSELF I'M 100 MYSELF WHEN I'M RAPPING AND I'M NOT A FAKE
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50002 I THINK EVERY CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF 13 SHOULD BE FORCED TO SMOKE FOUR PACKS OF CIGARETTES A
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50003 YOU'RE NOT LAUGHING AT THE FACT THAT I'M TRYING TO KILL MY BROTHERS
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50004 YOU'RE LAUGHING AT ME FOR BEING AN IDIOT FOR THINKING THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50005 NO COMEDIAN WANTS TO OFFEND YOU THAT'S NOT OUR JOB
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50006 HE MADE A JOKE ABOUT THE PARALYMPICS
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50008 THIS HAPPENED THIS HAPPENED THEN THIS HAPPENED THEREFORE THIS HAPPENED
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50009 MORAL OF THIS STORY IS
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50010 IT'S ALWAYS STUFF LIKE
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50011 EVERYTHING'S A DIFFERENT WAY OF TELLING A STORY
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50012 I TELL STORIES DIFFERENTLY AS WELL
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50013 I'M A COMEDIAN
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50014 TAKE IT HOME
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50015 AND SOMEHOW INTEGRATE MYSELF INTO THIS STORY SO I'D BECOME A HERO SO I CAN THEN GO OUT ON STAGE IN FRONT OF A
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50016 WE'RE DESPERATE STORYTELLERS
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50017 THEN SWITCH OVER TO EASTENDERS OR TRUE BLOOD WHERE THERE ARE SCENES OF MURDER SEXUAL
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50018 OH I CAN'T BELIEVE CHRISTOPHER WALTZ KILLED ALL THOSE JEWISH PEOPLE
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50019 SHE'S ON HER THIRD MARTINI SHE'S READY TO GO
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50020 WE MIGHT PLAY A VERSION OF OURSELVES
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50021 BUT WE CAN'T BE OUR TRUE SELVES
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50022 IF WE WERE TO COME ON STAGE AND TALK TO YOU ABOUT OUR REAL OPINIONS WITH BALANCED THOUGHT THROUGH POINTS WE
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50023 AND PEOPLE WENT MENTAL
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50024 THAT'S WHEN SHE KNEW ABOUT IT
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50025 NO OF COURSE
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50026 IT SEEMS THE GENERAL PUBLIC CAN SAY WHATEVER THEY WANT ABOUT CELEBRITIES BUT COMEDIANS CAN'T AND THAT'S HYPOCRISY
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50027 THAT'S NOT FAIR
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50028 THERE IS A MARKET FOR SHOCK COMEDY
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50029 A HUGE MARKET OK
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50030 BUT THERE'S ALSO A MARKET FOR LEGGING SADOMASOCHISM AND JUSTIN BIEBER
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50031 YOU DON'T TAKE OTHER STORYTELLER'S STORIES OUT OF CONTEXT
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50032 EVERYONE WOULD AGREE THAT MY DAD'S A DREADFUL MAN
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50033 THERE WAS NO MONSTER UNDER THE BED NO BOOGIE MAN IN THE CORNER
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50035 AND SOMETIMES WE TURN IT IN A WAY THAT YOU DON'T LIKE
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50036 THEY THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50037 WHEREAS MOST OF THE TIME IT'S A HARDSHIP THAT'S CAUSED US TO GET INTO COMEDY
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50038 OUR REACTION TO OUR HARDSHIPS WAS TO MAKE LIGHT OF THE SITUATION AND GET OVER IT AS OPPOSED TO GOING ROUND THE COUNTRY MAKING SURE THAT
trainval/8aSUUhW7SHU/50039 IF AT ANY POINT YOU'VE DIS AGREED WITH ANYTHING I'VE SAID DON'T WORRY IT WAS JUST A STORY I MADE IT ALL UP
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50002 WE KNEW A LOT ABOUT HER LIFE AND THE DAY SHE DIED
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50003 SHE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST BIRDS TO HAVE THIS TAG
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50004 THE CORNELL LAB OF ORNITHOLOGY HAS A LEADING CITIZEN SCIENCE PROGRAM WHERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT BIRDS
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50005 DAVID DO WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50006 SHARE IT WITH OTHER PEOPLE
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50007 BE A GOOD CITIZEN
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50008 THEY CAN ANSWER IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE ABOUT THE WORLD
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50009 IT BECAME A NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL STORY
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50010 AS MY FRIEND RYAN JACKS WHO WAS ATTACKED BY OWL CAPONE ONE MORNING JOGGING IN THE PARK SHARED WITH THE PAPER HE
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50011 AS A SURGEON HE THOUGHT I AM HAVING A STROKE OR I HAVE BEEN HIT BY LIGHTNING
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50012 I WANT YOU TO WALK AWAY THINKING THAT BIRDS ARE AWESOME THEIR STORIES MATTER AND THAT YOU CAN
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50013 I KNEW IT WAS EITHER A BARRED OWL OR A GREY HORNED OWL JUST PROTECTING ITS BREEDING TERRITORY
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50014 IT WAS FEARLESS
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50015 THE STORY EVOLVED MORE PEOPLE HAD THEIR CAPS STOLEN THE CITY PUT UP SOME SIGNS IT
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50016 WE HAD A GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT IT
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50017 FOR THREE YEARS STEPHEN JR FLEW AROUND NOBODY ACTUALLY SAW HIM
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50018 WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50019 SHE BRED SHE HAD A FAMILY AND THEN STAGGERED THE WORLD
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50020 IT BREEDS IN AN ARCTIC SUMMER WITH A DAY OF ALMOST 24 HOURS LONG
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50021 THEN IT FLIES SOUTH FOR ANOTHER SUMMER
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50022 YOU ARE IN A TEDX AUDIENCE I KNOW YOU ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT OTHER THINGS
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50023 THAT IS FLYING TO THE MOON BACK AND FORTH THREE TIMES
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50024 THEY SORT OF FLY OFF AND GO AWAY
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50025 WHERE DID THE BIRDS GO
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50026 A GERMAN PERSON WHO WASN'T A SCIENTIST SHOT THIS BIRD
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50027 AND SCIENTISTS WERE READY FOR THIS PIECE OF EVIDENCE
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50028 TEN DAYS AFTER I HAD MARKED IT IN OREGON SOMEONE IN CALIFORNIA TOOK ITS PICTURE
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50029 THIS IS A YOUNG BIRD
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50030 IT WAS A DATA POINT I COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN ANY OTHER WAY
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50031 IF YOU SEE A BIRD TAKE YOUR TIME LOOK AT IT TAKE A PICTURE SHARE IT
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50032 HE FIGURED OUT WHERE IT WAS
trainval/8b2vNkEtfpc/50033 IT JUST SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE
trainval/8C2t8P809x8/50001 THEN HE OR SHE AT THAT POINT THEY BOTH TOLD ME THAT THIS IS THE CURRENT STATE WHERE MANY BUGS THAT WE
trainval/8C2t8P809x8/50002 AND BEFORE WE LEAVE THIS ROOM WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE JOHN GETS BETTER
trainval/8C2t8P809x8/50003 THE TECHNOLOGY I USED TO UNDERSTAND THAT IS CALLED METABOLOMICS
trainval/8C2t8P809x8/50004 SO I DID AN EXPERIMENT IN THE LAB
trainval/8C2t8P809x8/50006 THIS IS GIVEN TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE DIARRHEA LIKE JOHN
trainval/8COaMKbNrX0/50001 THE GUN GOES OFF
trainval/8COaMKbNrX0/50002 AN AMERICAN SPRINTER JUMPS OUT TO THE FRONT
trainval/8COaMKbNrX0/50003 RATHER THAN BLOCKS JESSE OWENS HAD A GARDENING TROWEL THAT HE HAD TO USE TO DIG HOLES IN THE CINDERS TO START FROM
trainval/8COaMKbNrX0/50004 BIOMECHANICAL ANALYSIS OF THE SPEED OF OWENS' JOINTS SHOWS THAT HAD BEEN RUNNING ON THE SAME SURFACE AS BOLT
trainval/8COaMKbNrX0/50005 ON RARE OCCASIONS A HIGH SCHOOL KID DOES IT
trainval/8COaMKbNrX0/50006 SO IF YOU APPLY A ONE AND A HALF PERCENT SLOWDOWN CONVERSION TO EVERY MAN WHO RAN HIS SUB FOUR MILE ON A SYNTHETIC
trainval/8COaMKbNrX0/50007 AND THAT GUY WHO WON THE 1904 OLYMPIC MARATHON IN THREE IN A HALF HOURS THAT GUY WAS DRINKING RAT POISON AND
trainval/8COaMKbNrX0/50008 AND THIS SHOWED IN ATHLETES' BODIES
trainval/8COaMKbNrX0/50009 IN FACT IF YOU PLOT ON A HEIGHT VERSUS MASS GRAPH ONE DATA POINT FOR EACH OF TWO DOZEN SPORTS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE 20TH
trainval/8COaMKbNrX0/50010 WHAT'S HAPPENING WHEN THAT HAPPENS IS THAT THE ELECTRICAL IMPULSE IS CAUSING ALL THEIR MUSCLE FIBERS TO TWITCH AT ONCE AND THEY'RE THROWING
trainval/8COaMKbNrX0/50012 BUT NORMALLY WE CAN'T ACCESS NEARLY ALL OF IT
trainval/8COaMKbNrX0/50013 OUR PRIMATE COUSINS CAN'T DO THAT
trainval/8cwWSS29faQ/50001 IT'S THE SAME IN MARKETING
trainval/8cwWSS29faQ/50002 SO WITH THE ACT OF OBSERVING CONSUMERS CHANGES THEIR BEHAVIOR
trainval/8cwWSS29faQ/50003 THE MARKETING IS THE MESSAGE FOR MARKETING IS THAT TRY TO MEASURE WHAT CONSUMERS ACTUALLY
trainval/8cwWSS29faQ/50004 THIS DISTRIBUTION OF BRAND ENERGY GETS YOUR BRAND CLOSER TO THE PEOPLE MORE IN WITH THE PEOPLE
trainval/8cwWSS29faQ/50005 THE MESSAGE FOR MARKETING IS THAT YOUR BRAND IS MORE DISPERSED
trainval/8cwWSS29faQ/50006 YOU CAN'T FIGHT IT SO EMBRACE IT AND FIND A WAY TO WORK WITH IT
trainval/8Dv2Hdf5TRg/50001 MANY CHILDREN IN THIS STUDY WERE BORN INTO POOR FAMILIES OR INTO WORKING CLASS FAMILIES THAT HAD CRAMPED
trainval/8Dv2Hdf5TRg/50002 I'VE GOT THREE BOYS THEY'RE THREE NINE AND 12
trainval/8Dv2Hdf5TRg/50003 LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF THAT
trainval/8Dv2Hdf5TRg/50004 IN ONE STUDY SCIENTISTS LOOKED AT ABOUT 17000 CHILDREN WHO WERE BORN IN 1970
trainval/8Dv2Hdf5TRg/50006 AND ONE STUDY ACTUALLY PUT FIGURES ON THAT SO IT LOOKED AT CHILDREN GROWING UP IN PERSISTENT POVERTY AND HOW WELL THEY WERE
trainval/8Dv2Hdf5TRg/50007 NOW AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THE ANSWERS AREN'T QUITE AS SIMPLE AS THAT
trainval/8etnSTnX92g/50001 AND I BECAME FRIENDS WITH CHARACTERS IN BOOKS
trainval/8etnSTnX92g/50002 I BECAME FRIENDS WITH HERMIONE GRANGER AND JUNIE B
trainval/8etnSTnX92g/50003 AND AS A WRITER I FOCUSED MOSTLY ON QUEER YOUTH NARRATIVE
trainval/8etnSTnX92g/50004 BECAUSE THE THING ABOUT PETER IS HE WAS NEVER AFRAID
trainval/8etnSTnX92g/50005 A LOT OF US USE READING TO ESCAPE OUR REALITY
trainval/8etnSTnX92g/50006 HE BUILT A HOUSE AROUND HIM MADE OF CARDBOARD AND WOOD FROM THE GARAGE
trainval/8etnSTnX92g/50007 AND THERE'S A COUPLE REASONS FOR THAT
trainval/8etnSTnX92g/50008 AND HIS FATHER NEVER BLEW IT DOWN EVEN THOUGH IT SHIVERED WHEN PETER CRAWLED OUT OF IT AND SAID LOOK DAD
trainval/8etnSTnX92g/50009 QUEER VOICES NON QUEER VOICES AND I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT
trainval/8etnSTnX92g/50010 LOOK WHAT I MADE
trainval/8etnSTnX92g/50011 WHICH IS WHY I STARTED WRITING PETER AND THE CONCRETE JUNGLE
trainval/8etnSTnX92g/50012 SO I PLAYED A LOT WITH VISUAL FORM AND LANGUAGE
trainval/8etnSTnX92g/50013 I CAN'T TELL IF THE SLICK WATER LINES ARE RIVERS LEADING FROM HIS TEMPLES OR JUST UNDER HIS EYES
trainval/8etnSTnX92g/50014 I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT
trainval/8etnSTnX92g/50015 AND THIS REALLY NEEDS TO TURN INTO SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER
trainval/8FKYe2v0teI/50001 SO ORIGINS ARE IMPORTANT
trainval/8FKYe2v0teI/50002 WE CAN'T SAY THEY'RE NOT IMPORTANT THEY ARE IMPORTANT IN OUR LIVES
trainval/8GOFoquSdkI/50001 MY SEARCH FOR THAT TOOK ME TO 11 DIFFERENT COMPANIES IN THE FIRST YEAR
trainval/8GOFoquSdkI/50002 KEEP THAT IN MIND
trainval/8GOFoquSdkI/50003 THIS MOVEMENT IS ALREADY COMPOSED OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WITH THE SHARPEST MINDS AND THE GENTLEST
trainval/8GOFoquSdkI/50004 WE BELIEVE THAT THAT COLLECTIVE COMMITMENT IS GIVING RISE TO A NEW KIND OF EMPLOYEE
trainval/8gSAkUOElsg/50001 THAT'S NOT THE POINT
trainval/8gSAkUOElsg/50002 AND SO THE KIDS QUICKLY GET PAST THE STAGE WHERE THEY JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER STUFF AND CAN GET ONTO ACTUALLY USING
trainval/8gSAkUOElsg/50003 IT HELPS TO DEVELOP ALL THE MENTAL GYMNASTICS THAT'S INVOLVED IN HAVING TWO
trainval/8gSAkUOElsg/50006 WITH CHILDREN'S HANDS IT'S REALLY REALLY HARD TO PLAY
trainval/8gSAkUOElsg/50007 I'M NO GOOD AT MUSIC
trainval/8gSAkUOElsg/50008 A FEW PEOPLE CARRY IT ON BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF US DON'T
trainval/8gSAkUOElsg/50009 SO IS THIS SOME MASSIVE FAILURE OF PRIMARY SCHOOL POLICY
trainval/8gSAkUOElsg/50011 OF COURSE THAT'S NOT THE POINT
trainval/8gSAkUOElsg/50012 BY LEARNING THE RECORDER WE LEARN ABOUT MUSIC
trainval/8gSAkUOElsg/50013 WE START TO READ MUSIC
trainval/8gSAkUOElsg/50014 YOU LEARN ABOUT RHYTHM AND TIME SIGNATURES KEEPING TIME WITH OTHERS AND HARMONIES
trainval/8gSAkUOElsg/50015 IT'S HAPPENING AS WE SPEAK WITH LESSONS DELIVERED BY ESPERANTO SPECIALISTS LIKE ME BUT ALSO
trainval/8gSAkUOElsg/50016 ACTUALLY IT'S OBVIOUS
trainval/8gSAkUOElsg/50017 WHY IS IT SO GOOD AT THIS
trainval/8gSAkUOElsg/50018 AND THEN IT'S DUDEK UNU DUDEK DU AND SO ON ALL THE WAY UP TO 99
trainval/8gSAkUOElsg/50019 SO BY TRANSLATING THE NUMBER INTO ESPERANTO IT CLARIFIES WHAT'S GOING ON WHAT THAT 2' IN 27' ACTUALLY MEANS
trainval/8gSAkUOElsg/50022 NOW I'VE BEEN SPEAKING FRENCH FOR 25 YEARS I'VE LIVED IN FRANCE AND MY FAMILY IS BILINGUAL ENGLISH FRENCH AND
trainval/8HplGZBS7FY/50001 YOU'RE GOING TO BE THERE AREN'T YOU
trainval/8HplGZBS7FY/50002 I WAS SICK TO MY STOMACH
trainval/8HplGZBS7FY/50003 AND I WOULDN'T KNOW IT TILL THE END OF THE YEAR
trainval/8HplGZBS7FY/50004 BUT HE NEVER PUT A MOOD NUMBER BELOW 80 AGAIN
trainval/8HplGZBS7FY/50005 HE BECAME ONE OF THE MOST ENERGETIC SCIENCE STUDENTS I HAD ALL YEAR AND AT THE END OF THE YEAR HE TOLD ME SOMETHING THAT FOREVER
trainval/8HplGZBS7FY/50006 YOU SEE THERE'S A MILLION THINGS THAT SEEMS THAT CAN AFFECT OUR MOOD
trainval/8HplGZBS7FY/50007 AND IT DOES CHANGE THROUGHOUT THE DAY
trainval/8HplGZBS7FY/50008 WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER TODAY
trainval/8HplGZBS7FY/50009 SO IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE PEOPLE'S LIVES START BY CHANGING PEOPLE'S NUMBERS
trainval/8iZSsHd0IlU/50001 WHAT IS IT REALLY
trainval/8iZSsHd0IlU/50003 YOU KNOW BAD IDEA
trainval/8jkri0AeZWQ/50001 TO BIGGER THINGS LIKE WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH MY 401K
trainval/8jkri0AeZWQ/50002 SO MEET JESSICA
trainval/8jkri0AeZWQ/50004 THEN SHE'S GOING TO SPEND 1200 ON RENT
trainval/8jkri0AeZWQ/50005 WHY DO I HAVE TO WORRY SO MUCH
trainval/8jkri0AeZWQ/50006 INSTEAD OF AGGRESSIVELY PAYING IT DOWN SHE ONLY GOING TO PAY HER MINIMUM PAYMENTS
trainval/8jkri0AeZWQ/50007 APPLYING THOSE EXACT SAME BEHAVIORAL TRAITS NOT LEARNING MUCH MORE ABOUT PERSONAL FINANCE MAKING A FEW MORE
trainval/8jkri0AeZWQ/50008 AMERICA IS STRUGGLING WITH OBESITY AND THIS IS A SHOW THAT BRINGS THAT TO THE FOREFRONT
trainval/8jkri0AeZWQ/50009 WE'RE IN A POSITION WHERE THE AMERICAN DREAM OF HOME OWNERSHIP IS NOT A REALITY AS 25 OF
trainval/8jkri0AeZWQ/50010 THEY'LL GO OFF TO COLLEGE AND THEY'LL BE IN A SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER PLACE THAN JESSICA WAS DECADES AGO
trainval/8jkri0AeZWQ/50011 I WANT THAT FOR JESSICA
trainval/8jkri0AeZWQ/50012 I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE CAN GO BACK TO THE TENS OF MILLIONS WE CAN ULTIMATELY GO BACK TO JESSICA AND
trainval/8jPQjjsBbIc/50001 SO IN THE HOME DESIGNATE A SPOT FOR YOUR KEYS A HOOK BY THE DOOR MAYBE A DECORATIVE BOWL
trainval/8jPQjjsBbIc/50002 FOR YOUR PASSPORT A PARTICULAR DRAWER
trainval/8jPQjjsBbIc/50003 FOR YOUR READING GLASSES A PARTICULAR TABLE
trainval/8jPQjjsBbIc/50004 REMEMBER WHEN YOU'RE UNDER STRESS THE BRAIN RELEASES CORTISOL
trainval/8jPQjjsBbIc/50005 AND THERE'S PERHAPS NO MORE STRESSFUL A SITUATION THAN WHEN YOU'RE CONFRONTED WITH A MEDICAL DECISION TO MAKE
trainval/8jPQjjsBbIc/50006 AND SO YOU'RE THINKING YEAH
trainval/8jPQjjsBbIc/50007 MY DOCTOR WOULDN'T PRESCRIBE SOMETHING TO ME IF IT'S NOT GOING TO HELP
trainval/8jPQjjsBbIc/50008 AND THEY INCLUDE TERRIBLE THINGS DEBILITATING MUSCLE AND JOINT PAIN GASTROINTESTINAL DISTRESS
trainval/8jPQjjsBbIc/50009 BUT WAIT A MINUTE
trainval/8jPQjjsBbIc/50010 THEY INCLUDE IMPOTENCE ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION URINARY INCONTINENCE RECTAL TEARING
trainval/8jPQjjsBbIc/50011 AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY AND YOU'RE ONE OF THE 50 PERCENT WHO HAS THESE THEY'LL ONLY LAST FOR A YEAR OR TWO
trainval/8jPQjjsBbIc/50012 THESE ARE THINGS TO TALK ABOUT AND THINK ABOUT NOW WITH YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR LOVED ONES
trainval/8jPQjjsBbIc/50013 YOU MIGHT CHANGE YOUR MIND IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT BUT AT LEAST YOU'RE PRACTICED WITH THIS KIND OF THINKING
trainval/8jPQjjsBbIc/50014 300 PEOPLE HAVE TO TAKE THE DRUG FOR A YEAR BEFORE ONE HEART ATTACK STROKE OR OTHER ADVERSE EVENT IS PREVENTED
trainval/8JSMI8Xrwms/50001 I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH MY LIFE WAS ABOUT TO CHANGE
trainval/8JSMI8Xrwms/50002 FOR SOME IT IS SHARING THEIR STORY
trainval/8JSMI8Xrwms/50003 SHE GAVE ME A PIN FOR LISTENING
trainval/8JSMI8Xrwms/50004 HER NAME WAS CAMERON GALLAGHER
trainval/8JSMI8Xrwms/50005 WE GOT LUNCH AND WENT TO THE PARK
trainval/8JSMI8Xrwms/50006 LATER THAT NIGHT MY MUM TOLD ME THAT I WAS A REALLY GOOD FRIEND BUT I DON'T THINK I DID ANYTHING SPECIAL BECAUSE
trainval/8JSMI8Xrwms/50007 SHE DIED THAT DAY
trainval/8JSMI8Xrwms/50008 I WILL ALWAYS SHARE SPENDING CAMERON'S LAST DAY WITH HER
trainval/8JSMI8Xrwms/50009 WHEN PROMO STARTED FOR THE 5K MAMMA GRACE STARTED TELLING PEOPLE THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO BE NICE TO
trainval/8JSMI8Xrwms/50010 THAT SPEAKS VOLUMES TO MY MESSAGE OF COMPASSION
trainval/8khcH5Lqxgk/50001 AND IT MIGHT JUST SEEM LIKE THAT JUST LIKE FICTION
trainval/8lEUvISNgEE/50001 ANY GUESSES HOW BIG IS THAT NUMBER
trainval/8lEUvISNgEE/50002 SO THAT IS MY STORY BUT I'M ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU CARES ABOUT
trainval/8LQhhYgjlJ0/50001 WE SHOULD VALUE THAT AS AN ATHLETIC ACTIVITY IN AND OF ITSELF AND NOTHING TO HOW IT COMPARES TO PEOPLE WITHOUT
trainval/8lw30T0v44A/50001 I HOPE YOU GUYS ENJOY IT
trainval/8m1X26Auw6Q/50001 THE LINE ON THE BOTTOM SHOWS THEN SHOWS THE CHANGE IN CHEMISTRY
trainval/8m1X26Auw6Q/50002 SO WE START AT THE BOTTOM WHICH CAN BE OVER FOUR KILOMETERS DEEP JUST OFF OUR CONTINENTAL SHELF AND WE TAKE
trainval/8m1X26Auw6Q/50003 THEY MODERATE OUR CLIMATE
trainval/8m1X26Auw6Q/50004 AND THEY PROVIDE JOBS AND MEDICINE AND FOOD INCLUDING 20 PERCENT OF
trainval/8m1X26Auw6Q/50005 WELL TODAY I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT A SERIOUS REALITY THAT IS CHANGING OUR OCEANS CALLED
trainval/8m5Ebx6nuGE/50001 WE DON'T LOOK BACKWARD
trainval/8m5Ebx6nuGE/50002 WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM UPSTREAM
trainval/8m5Ebx6nuGE/50003 HE SAID HE TOLD YOU IT WAS NOT BAD
trainval/8m5Ebx6nuGE/50004 THIS IS POLAND JOHN NOT CALIFORNIA
trainval/8m5Ebx6nuGE/50005 WHERE DOES IT COME FROM
trainval/8m5Ebx6nuGE/50006 COME ON YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING
trainval/8m5Ebx6nuGE/50007 BUT APPARENTLY NOT
trainval/8m5Ebx6nuGE/50008 HE SAID WRITING GREAT CODE
trainval/8m5Ebx6nuGE/50009 AND THEN WHAT MIGHT THAT MAKE POSSIBLE
trainval/8m5Ebx6nuGE/50010 AND I SAID HOW MANY
trainval/8m5Ebx6nuGE/50011 AND HE SAID OH A COUPLE OF MILLION
trainval/8m5Ebx6nuGE/50012 NOW THAT IS SOMETHING
trainval/8m5Ebx6nuGE/50013 WHAT RUNS YOU RIGHT NOW
trainval/8m5Ebx6nuGE/50014 I DON'T THINK SO
trainval/8m5Ebx6nuGE/50015 HE SAID WHAT WOULD BE A PURPOSE WORTHY OF WHO YOU ARE
trainval/8m5Ebx6nuGE/50016 WHAT DO YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT
trainval/8m5Ebx6nuGE/50017 I SAID TRANSFORMING THE WORLD AT WORK
trainval/8m5Ebx6nuGE/50018 IT TURNS OUT THAT WAS JUST MORE THAN A MARKETING STATEMENT FOR ME
trainval/8m5Ebx6nuGE/50019 DON'T DO ANYTHING LESS THAN THAT
trainval/8m5Ebx6nuGE/50020 THAT IS WHAT LIGHTS ME UP
trainval/8m5Ebx6nuGE/50021 THIS IS REALLY CRUCIAL SO HERE YOU GO
trainval/8m5Ebx6nuGE/50022 I LIKE WHAT WOODY ALLEN SAID
trainval/8meWY0W40OA/50001 ALREADY THAT'S FALLEN TO ABOUT 11
trainval/8meWY0W40OA/50002 AND THAT'S WHY NOW THE NEW BREAKTHROUGHS THE NEW FRONTIERS IN TERMS OF OIL EXTRACTION ARE SCRAMBLING ABOUT IN
trainval/8meWY0W40OA/50003 SO THE IPCC SAID THAT WE MIGHT SEE SIGNIFICANT BREAKUP OF THE ARCTIC ICE IN 2100 IN THEIR WORST
trainval/8meWY0W40OA/50004 BUT THE WORLD ISN'T SECOND LIFE
trainval/8meWY0W40OA/50005 AND AS WE SIT EXCHANGING FREE IDEAS WITH EACH OTHER THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE MINING COAL IN ORDER TO POWER THE
trainval/8meWY0W40OA/50006 IT'S SOMETHING WHICH EVERYBODY WHO'S INVOLVED WITH IT DEVELOPS AND PASSES ON AS THEY WORK WITH IT
trainval/8meWY0W40OA/50008 THERE IS NO GREAT CENTRAL ORGANIZATION THAT PUSHES THIS PEOPLE JUST PICK UP AN IDEA AND THEY RUN WITH IT AND THEY IMPLEMENT IT WHERE THEY
trainval/8meWY0W40OA/50009 IT LEARNS VERY MUCH FROM ITS MISTAKES
trainval/8meWY0W40OA/50010 AND IT FEELS HISTORIC
trainval/8meWY0W40OA/50011 IT TRIES TO CREATE A SENSE THAT THIS IS A HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING REALLY EXTRAORDINARY
trainval/8meWY0W40OA/50012 AND I THINK IT'S A MORE USEFUL CONCEPT THAN SUSTAINABILITY AS I SAID
trainval/8meWY0W40OA/50013 YOU KNOW IT'S A KIND OF NICE IDEA BUT WHAT DO THEY ACTUALLY DO ON THE GROUND
trainval/8meWY0W40OA/50014 WE NEED NATIONAL RESPONSES
trainval/8meWY0W40OA/50015 WE NEED LOCAL GOVERNMENT RESPONSES
trainval/8meWY0W40OA/50016 BUT ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE GOING TO BE MUCH EASIER IF WE HAVE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE VIBRANT AND COMING UP WITH IDEAS AND LEADING
trainval/8meWY0W40OA/50017 AND ALSO STARTING TO PLAY AROUND WITH THE IDEA OF ALTERNATIVE CURRENCIES
trainval/8meWY0W40OA/50018 AND HOW CAN WE EMBRACE THAT AND ACTUALLY COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT WAS ACTUALLY MORE LIKELY TO SUSTAIN EVERYBODY
trainval/8meWY0W40OA/50019 ED MILIBAND THE ENERGY MINISTER OF THIS COUNTRY WAS INVITED TO COME TO OUR RECENT CONFERENCE AS A KEYNOTE
trainval/8meWY0W40OA/50020 AND IT IS SOMETHING WHICH HAS SEVERAL CHARACTERISTICS
trainval/8n5O9tz30So/50001 IN THE 16 STATES IN 2005 THAT INSTITUTED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS SAYING THAT GAY MARRIAGE IS WRONG AND
trainval/8n5O9tz30So/50002 THIS HURTS PEOPLE
trainval/8n5O9tz30So/50003 THINK ABOUT THAT RIGHT
trainval/8n5O9tz30So/50004 ALL THOSE LET'S SAY POLITICIANS WHO ARE SUDDENLY LOOKING FOR A LITTLE BOYS IN AIRPORT BATHROOMS
trainval/8n5O9tz30So/50005 IT'S JUST NOT COOL
trainval/8n5O9tz30So/50006 AND THAT STATISTIC IS BEARED OUT IN THE FACT THAT THERE'S LESS CRIME IN THE CITIES WHERE THERE'S MORE PORN WATCHED
trainval/8n5O9tz30So/50007 WE ARE ALLOWED TO DRAW OUR OWN BOUNDARIES
trainval/8n5O9tz30So/50008 I WANT YOU TO READ THE SURVEY THAT YOU HAVE AND I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT SOMEBODY NEXT TO YOU AND I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT HIM IN THE EYE AND
trainval/8oeiOeDqSNc/50001 THE THREE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF A DECENTRALIZED LEGAL SYSTEM ARE
trainval/8oHvknJfklE/50001 THEN THEY GOT ME MAPPED
trainval/8oHvknJfklE/50002 AH YOU'RE A KENYAN ASIAN
trainval/8oHvknJfklE/50004 IT WAS A MEMBER OF THIS SAME HINDU FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENT WHO SHOT DEAD MAHATMA
trainval/8oHvknJfklE/50005 IT UNDERMINES OUR FIXED TRUTHS AND WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE OUR CULTURE' AND THEIR CULTURE
trainval/8OkzozrUEHY/50001 OF COURSE WELL HOW DO I DO 4
trainval/8OkzozrUEHY/50002 WE FIND WHAT WORKS AND THEN WE PROTECT IT WE DEFEND IT AGAINST EVERYTHING ELSE
trainval/8OkzozrUEHY/50003 AND YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/8OkzozrUEHY/50004 THERE'S ACTUALLY 2 ON THAT SIDE 2 ON THIS SIDE
trainval/8OkzozrUEHY/50005 AND IT'S IN THOSE SPACES THAT WE RECLAIM CONTROL OF OUR LIVES
trainval/8OkzozrUEHY/50006 AND THERE'S AN INFINITE WAY THAT YOU CAN DEFINE YOUR LIFE
trainval/8olL43PKJKw/50001 THE QUESTION HURTS ME
trainval/8olL43PKJKw/50002 I'M SHAKING A LITTLE BIT
trainval/8olL43PKJKw/50003 BUT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT AND INVITE YOU INTO AN INSIDE CONVERSATION TODAY BECAUSE IT IS NECESSARY AND
trainval/8olL43PKJKw/50004 BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU THE STATISTICS
trainval/8olL43PKJKw/50005 82 PERCENT OF BLACK WOMEN ARE OVER A HEALTHY WEIGHT RIGHT NOW
trainval/8olL43PKJKw/50006 THAT'S EVERY 11 MINUTES
trainval/8olL43PKJKw/50007 WE ASKED OURSELVES THAT SAME QUESTION
trainval/8olL43PKJKw/50008 WHY IS WHAT'S OUT THERE NOT WORKING FOR THEM
trainval/8olL43PKJKw/50009 AND THEN JUST DAYS AFTER THAT I GOT MY STEPS IN TODAY FOR MY BABY NORM
trainval/8olL43PKJKw/50010 SO WE STUDIED MODELS LIKE WANGARI MAATHAI WHO WON THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE FOR INSPIRING WOMEN TO PLANT 50 MILLION TREES IN
trainval/8olL43PKJKw/50011 LET ME RALLY MY TEAM
trainval/8olL43PKJKw/50012 LET ME GRAB SOME SUPPLIES
trainval/8olL43PKJKw/50013 VANESSA AND I WERE IN FORT LAUDERDALE
trainval/8OnsjVdEuRk/50001 AND WE SAID WELL THE FIRST ERECTION WOULD TAKE ONE WEEK
trainval/8pHzROP1DSw/50001 SO WHAT IS NEW ABOUT BIG DATA
trainval/8pHzROP1DSw/50002 SO IT'S 4000 YEARS OLD
trainval/8pHzROP1DSw/50003 AND WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN REUSE THIS INFORMATION FOR USES THAT WE NEVER EVEN IMAGINED WHEN WE FIRST
trainval/8pHzROP1DSw/50004 IN THIS RESPECT LOCATION HAS BEEN DATAFIED
trainval/8pHzROP1DSw/50005 IT INCREASES THE ACCURACY OF ITS PREDICTION
trainval/8pHzROP1DSw/50006 YOU FIGURE IT OUT
trainval/8pHzROP1DSw/50007 THREE OF THE TRAITS WERE ONES THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T NEED TO LOOK FOR BUT THAT THE MACHINE
trainval/8pHzROP1DSw/50008 PRIVACY WAS THE CENTRAL CHALLENGE IN A SMALL DATA ERA
trainval/8pHzROP1DSw/50009 HE OR SHE VOTES
trainval/8pHzROP1DSw/50010 HE OR SHE IS A STAKEHOLDER IN SOCIETY
trainval/8pHzROP1DSw/50011 AND THAT PERSON'S JOB AS WELL AS AN ENTIRE FLEET OF PROFESSIONALS LIKE THAT PERSON IS GOING TO FIND THAT THEIR
trainval/8pHzROP1DSw/50012 IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE THE CHALLENGE THAT WAS FACED BY PRIMITIVE MAN AND FIRE
trainval/8PQc3M2HQSs/50001 LIKE THAT IS IT SPEAKS TO ME RIGHT
trainval/8pqStCgDkT4/50001 IF YOU'RE IRRITATED BY SOMETHING SOMEONE ELSE IS DOING PAUSE AND REFLECT ON WHY
trainval/8pqStCgDkT4/50002 WHY IS THIS HAPPENING
trainval/8pqStCgDkT4/50003 WHAT'S GOING ON
trainval/8pqStCgDkT4/50004 BECAUSE VERY LIKELY IT'S MORE ABOUT YOU THAN ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE
trainval/8pqStCgDkT4/50005 EVERYONE BRINGS A UNIQUE PERSONALITY AND THEY'RE DYING FOR YOU TO NOTICE IT
trainval/8qqLMFBGvWI/50001 US HUMANS HAVE MADE A GREAT ART AT THE DISCONNECT ABOUT WHAT IT IS WE ACTUALLY EAT
trainval/8qqLMFBGvWI/50002 BEFORE I STOPPED EATING ANIMALS CHICKEN WAS MY FAVOURITE MEAT
trainval/8qqLMFBGvWI/50003 IF DUCK WAS ON THE MENU THAT'S WHAT I'D ORDER
trainval/8qqLMFBGvWI/50004 THE DEFENDERS OF THE INDUSTRY SAY IT'S NECESSARY BECAUSE THE BIRDS ARE AGGRESSIVE
trainval/8qqLMFBGvWI/50005 FOR MOST PEOPLE THEIR ENCOUNTERS WITH POULTRY ARE WHEN THEY'RE IN THE SUPERMARKET SHOPPING OR WHEN
trainval/8qqLMFBGvWI/50006 AND THEN SOMETIMES I ACTUALLY STOP MYSELF AND THINK
trainval/8rzlrItooG4/50001 SOME ATTRIBUTE THIS GOLDEN WORLD KNOWLEDGE TO PLATO OTHERS TO PYTHAGORAS
trainval/8rzlrItooG4/50002 WOULD YOU GET A DIVORCE
trainval/8rZzHkpyPkc/50001 THE WOLVES KILLED COYOTES AND AS A RESULT OF THAT THE NUMBER OF RABBITS AND MICE
trainval/8rZzHkpyPkc/50002 RAVENS AND BALD EAGLES CAME DOWN TO FEED ON THE CARRION THAT THE WOLVES HAD LEFT
trainval/8rZzHkpyPkc/50003 REWILDING TO ME MEANS BRINGING BACK SOME OF THE MISSING PLANTS AND ANIMALS
trainval/8rZzHkpyPkc/50004 IT'S NOT CLIMATE LARGELY WHICH HAS GOT RID OF THE WORLD'S MEGAFAUNAS
trainval/8rZzHkpyPkc/50005 AND THEY MAKE IN MY VIEW A POWERFUL CASE FOR THE REINTRODUCTION OF MISSING
trainval/8s3bdVxuFBs/50001 HIS TOUR MANAGER CALLED ME UP AND SAYS WE'RE ON TOUR IN FARGO NORTH DAKOTA
trainval/8s3bdVxuFBs/50002 HE'LL PROBABLY HAVE SEVERAL MANSIONS
trainval/8s3bdVxuFBs/50003 HE'D EASILY TRADE YOU ONE OF THEM
trainval/8s3bdVxuFBs/50005 MARK SAYS I'M AN AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHER WITH A LOT OF KISS MEMORABILIA
trainval/8s3bdVxuFBs/50006 ARE YOU BE INTERESTED IN ANY OF THAT
trainval/8s3bdVxuFBs/50008 I REALLY WANTED TO TRADE WITH HIM
trainval/8s3bdVxuFBs/50009 WHAT DO YOU HAVE
trainval/8s3bdVxuFBs/50011 BUT BEFORE I GET STARTED ON THAT STORY I WANT TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THIS SLIDE BEHIND ME
trainval/8s3bdVxuFBs/50012 WE'RE IMPROVING EACH OTHER'S LIVES ALBEIT ON A SMALL SCALE
trainval/8s3bdVxuFBs/50014 I'LL TRADE YOU MY WORST SNOWMOBILE
trainval/8s3bdVxuFBs/50015 I WAS INTRIGUED JUST BY THE IDEA OF SOMEBODY'S WORST SNOWMOBILE
trainval/8s3bdVxuFBs/50016 AND WE MET UP ONE NIGHT
trainval/8s3bdVxuFBs/50017 HALF OF IT'S UNRENTED
trainval/8s3bdVxuFBs/50021 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN
trainval/8s3bdVxuFBs/50022 HE'S WELL WE NEED TOWN COUNCIL APPROVAL
trainval/8s3bdVxuFBs/50023 I SAY ALRIGHT IF YOU CAN GET IT THAT'D BE GREAT
trainval/8s3bdVxuFBs/50024 TURNS OUT TOWN COUNCIL APPROVAL WAS GETTING TWO PEOPLE TO PUT THEIR HAND IN THE AIR
trainval/8s3bdVxuFBs/50025 IF YOU HAVE A PAPERCLIP TRADE IT AWAY
trainval/8S66QUJk3w4/50001 WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THE TYPICAL TWO WOMEN AND THE POSTMAN COMES IN OR THE TWO WOMEN AND THE
trainval/8S66QUJk3w4/50002 YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
trainval/8S66QUJk3w4/50003 BECAUSE IT MAKES ME OUT SOMETHING I'M NOT
trainval/8S66QUJk3w4/50004 CAN I JOIN IN
trainval/8S66QUJk3w4/50008 I CAN DO IT IT'S FINE
trainval/8S66QUJk3w4/50009 AND IT'S LIKE MY SEXUALITY ISN'T UP FOR GRABS IT ISN'T UP TO CHANGE
trainval/8S66QUJk3w4/50010 AND THAT'S LIKE I SAID WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING IT'S A NATURAL STATE OF MIND OF CAUTIOUSNESS
trainval/8S66QUJk3w4/50011 IT'S NOT FAIR THAT I HAVE TO WAKE UP AND FEEL LIKE THAT EACH DAY
trainval/8S66QUJk3w4/50012 AND THEY ONLY WENT OUT FOR A GOOD NIGHT NOT TO BE PERSECUTED FOR WHO THEY ARE
trainval/8S66QUJk3w4/50013 DON'T TREAT SOMEONE LIKE THAT
trainval/8S66QUJk3w4/50014 NOW HOW YOU CAN HELP
trainval/8S66QUJk3w4/50015 I'M TELLING YOU MY STORY TODAY BECAUSE I'D LIKE YOU TO GET INTO MY LIFE JUST FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES
trainval/8S6S5vZGSSk/50001 WE TEACH SWIMMING AND SOCCER
trainval/8S6S5vZGSSk/50002 THE QUESTION FOR US THIS AFTERNOON IS REALLY
trainval/8S6S5vZGSSk/50003 WE ARE BEGINNING TO LOOK AT ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION FOR NON VIOLENT CRIME
trainval/8S6S5vZGSSk/50004 MOST OF THESE INTERVENTIONS THOUGH TARGET LATE ADOLESCENTS OR ADULTHOOD WHEN
trainval/8SAWKDRHZuw/50001 BEFORE HIS MOTHER DIED SHE TRIED TO CATCH HIS EYE
trainval/8SAWKDRHZuw/50002 HE REFUSED TO LOOK AT HER
trainval/8SAWKDRHZuw/50003 LET ME ASK YOU HOW MANY OF YOU KNEW BEFORE I STARTED TALKING THAT THERE ARE CONCENTRATION CAMPS IN NORTH KOREA
trainval/8SAWKDRHZuw/50004 HE'D BEEN EDUCATED IN THE FORMER SOVIET UNION
trainval/8SAWKDRHZuw/50005 THE ELECTRIC FENCE
trainval/8SAWKDRHZuw/50006 THE ELECTRIFIED FENCE THAT SURROUNDS THE CAMP
trainval/8SAWKDRHZuw/50007 SHIN DID NOT HESITATE THOUGH
trainval/8SAWKDRHZuw/50008 HE SAYS THAT HE'S PHYSICALLY OUTSIDE BUT NOT PSYCHOLOGICALLY OUTSIDE BARBED WIRE
trainval/8SAWKDRHZuw/50009 ONE OF THE THINGS HE TOLD ME IS THAT HE'S EVOLVING FROM BEING AN ANIMAL INTO TRYING TO BE A HUMAN
trainval/8SAWKDRHZuw/50010 THERE ARE 24000 NORTH KOREANS NOW LIVING IN SOUTH KOREA
trainval/8SAWKDRHZuw/50011 ALMOST ALL OF THEM HAVE COME THERE IN THE PAST 12 YEARS
trainval/8SAWKDRHZuw/50012 ALMOST ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN EXAMINED BY GOVERNMENT PSYCHIATRISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS IN SOUTH KOREA WHO SAY THAT
trainval/8SAWKDRHZuw/50013 THEY HAVE A HARD TIME DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN CRITICISM AND BETRAYAL
trainval/8SAWKDRHZuw/50014 AND NO ONE IS THINKING THAT NORTH KOREA IS ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE BUT TOTALITARIAN SYSTEMS DON'T LAST
trainval/8SG4H4sVSW8/50001 THAT SOUNDED LIKE A SOAP OPERA THEN
trainval/8SG4H4sVSW8/50002 BUT YOU'LL NEVER GET ANYWHERE
trainval/8SG4H4sVSW8/50003 SO NOW WHEN WE LOOK TO RUSSIA AND THE FORMER SOVIET UNION AND OTHER COMMUNIST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD IN MOST CASES WE'RE SEEING A
trainval/8SmeicgKjwA/50001 SO WHEN YOU SEE A WOMAN WITH BRAIDS OR LOCKS DRAPING DOWN HER BACK
trainval/8t4Vj6lmzVo/50001 ACCESS OUR DATA
trainval/8t987Lxt1t4/50001 SO THEN MY IDEA WAS OK SO WHAT IF I TRIED TO BRING PHILOSOPHY
trainval/8t987Lxt1t4/50002 SO I THOUGHT HE'S OUR GUY
trainval/8t987Lxt1t4/50003 SO THAT'S HOW WE SHOULD RELATE TO OTHERS
trainval/8t987Lxt1t4/50004 THE FIRST ONE IS SOCIAL
trainval/8t987Lxt1t4/50005 AND I WOULD LIKE TO QUALIFY THAT IDEA
trainval/8t987Lxt1t4/50006 SO WHY TO ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE
trainval/8t987Lxt1t4/50007 BUT I'M ALSO GOING TO GIVE YOU A PERSONAL MORE INDIVIDUAL REASON
trainval/8tEuaj4h8dw/50001 THE LAST CHAPTER IN ANY SUCCESSFUL GENOCIDE IS THE ONE IN WHICH THE OPPRESSOR CAN
trainval/8u9Wvz1edxI/50001 THIS IS WHAT WE CALL THESE WOMEN IN MY TRIBE IN KENYA
trainval/8u9Wvz1edxI/50002 IT SEEMED LIKE SUCH AN UNFAIR AND INACCURATE PORTRAYAL OF A POPULATION OF WOMEN WHO
trainval/8u9Wvz1edxI/50003 BUT THEN AS SOON AS YOU GRADUATE COLLEGE IT SEEMS LIKE THIS WHOLE SET OF STANDARDS
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50001 SO IT TRICKLES INTO YOUR BODY SLOWER
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50002 APPLE JUICE ON THE OTHER HAND IS IMMEDIATE
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50003 AND THAT IMMEDIACY STRESSES YOUR BODY OUT
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50004 BUT THE PROBLEM WITH SUGAR IS THAT I'M NOT ALONE
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50005 WE ALL REALLY LIKE IT
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50006 IT PULLS OUR TRIGGERS IN WAYS THAT MAKES US WANT TO EAT MORE
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50007 IT IS OVERWHELMING ALL OF THE CHOICES WE'RE FACED WITH TODAY
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50008 AND WHAT MAKES A FOOD PROCESSED
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50009 OF COURSE ALL FOODS ARE PROCESSED
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50010 AGRICULTURE IS A KIND OF PROCESS SO IS COOKING FERMENTING DICING PRESERVING
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50011 ALL FOODS ARE PROCESSED AND OFTEN THEY ARE BETTER FOR IT
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50012 PEOPLE CAN MAKE CORN INTO CORN TORTILLAS
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50013 PEOPLE CAN'T REALLY MAKE HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP WITHOUT ACCESS TO A LABORATORY AND AN ADVANCED CHEMISTRY DEGREE
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50014 THE SECOND PROCESS IS WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU WHEN YOU ACTUALLY EAT THAT FOOD
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50015 HOW YOUR BODY RESPONDS WHEN YOU DRINK A GLASS OF APPLE JUICE VERSUS EATING AN APPLE
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50016 AND IT IS THIS LAST ONE THAT OF CONSUMER SPENDING THAT I FIND THE MOST POTENTIAL FOR UN PROCESSING
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50017 YOU STOP AT THE STORE ON THE WAY HOME TO SEE IF THEY HAVE KALE
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50018 HOW DOES A WATERMELON GET FROM THE GROUND IN HERMOSILLO TO A SAFEWAY IN TUCSON
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50019 IT STARTS ON A FARM A REALLY BIG FARM 1000 ACRES OF WATERMELON
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50020 A MIGRATING FIELD CREW GOES IN THERE AND HARVESTS THEM WITHIN A DAY THEY PACK THEM UP PUT THEM ON A SEMI TRUCK
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50021 AND LET ME TELL YOU THE SCALE IS STAGGERING
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50022 AT THIS PARTICULAR WAREHOUSE DURING THEIR HIGH SEASON EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY MIGHT MOVE IN AND OUT
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50023 I REMEMBER STANDING IN THIS WAREHOUSE FULL OF MANGOES AND IT BEING INCONCEIVABLE TO ME HOW THIS MASS OF FRUIT MIGHT EVER
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50024 THE SYSTEM IS VAST
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50025 AND ITS SURVIVAL DEPENDS ON PESTICIDES REFRIGERATION AND SEMI TRUCKS
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50026 THIS IS WHAT I EAT
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50027 YES WE CALL HIM FARMER FRANK
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50028 SO WHEN YOU BUY FOOD THAT'S GONE THROUGH THIS VAST SYSTEM YOU ARE SUPPORTING THAT 91 CENTS
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50029 LET'S GO TO THE SECOND PROCESS
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50030 AND THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS SUGAR
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50031 SUGAR IS IN EVERYTHING
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50032 BEFORE I GO THERE I WILL SAY I LOVE SUGAR
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50033 IT IS IN FOR EXAMPLE IN THE BLUEBERRY FLAVORED FLAX SEEDS
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50034 THE SPINACH OF BREAKFAST CONFECTIONS
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50036 AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES SUGAR SO TRICKY
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50037 IT COMES IN SO MANY DIFFERENT FORMS IT'S REALLY HAD TO AVOID
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50038 BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW IS THAT FOR YOUR BODY SUGAR IS SUGAR
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50039 DO YOU FEEL DIFFERENTLY
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50040 I HAVE DIETED ON AND OFF MY WHOLE LIFE
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50041 I'VE COUNTED CALORIES I'VE DONE WEIGHT WATCHERS REALLY I'VE BEEN THROUGH THE WRINGER
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50042 MAKE IT YOUR ONE SWEET A DAY
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50043 LET'S GO BACK TO TONIGHT
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50044 I AM AWARE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE FOR WHOM 4 50C A MEAL IS SIMPLY UNAFFORDABLE
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50046 I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN THAT I DEDICATED THE LAST CHAPTER OF MY BOOK TO THE ENDEAVOR OF EATING UNPROCESSED ON THE AMOUNT OF
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50047 BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS MOST OF US HAVE A FEW DOLLARS THAT WE COULD SPEND DIFFERENTLY
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50048 BUT I READ WHAT WE HAVE READ
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50049 I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHERE MY FOOD IS COMING FROM BECAUSE I KNOW WHERE IS COMING FROM
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50050 I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHERE MY MONEY IS GOING BECAUSE I KNOW WHO'S GETTING MY MONEY
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50051 IT'S ONE RULE AND THEN I DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50052 I CAN DO WHAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO WITH FOOD WHICH IS SIMPLY ENJOY IT
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50053 YOU DO THINGS AND I DO THINGS
trainval/8Ug1MnU6LKw/50054 IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU AND I DECIDE TO MAKE SMALL CHANGES IN OUR OWN LIVES THAT BIG CHANGE BEGINS TO
trainval/8vSGrrQs8ow/50001 THANKS VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING
trainval/8vSGrrQs8ow/50002 THEY NEED TO CARRY OUT IMPACT ASSESSMENT TO IDENTIFY AND FIX THE PROBLEMS
trainval/8woKcr7uSYQ/50001 NOW I WAS PERHAPS AN UNLIKELY CHAMPION FOR THIS CAUSE
trainval/8woKcr7uSYQ/50002 I STUDIED CHILDREN'S LITERATURE BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO WORK WITH KIDS AND BOOKS
trainval/8woKcr7uSYQ/50003 AND I WALKED IN AND WAS ASSIGNED A THREE YEAR OLD NAMED MARIA
trainval/8woKcr7uSYQ/50004 WE'RE LETTING OUR FEAR AND OUR SKEPTICISM ABOUT THESE DEVICES HOLD US BACK FROM REALIZING THEIR
trainval/8woKcr7uSYQ/50005 WHERE DID THEY MAKE A FEW MISTAKES BEFORE THEY FOUND THE RIGHT ANSWER
trainval/8woKcr7uSYQ/50006 WHAT IF THEY COULD REDUCE TESTING ANXIETY
trainval/8woKcr7uSYQ/50007 WHAT IF WE START TALKING TO KIDS REGULARLY ABOUT THE CONTENT ON THESE SCREENS
trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50001 I'VE GOT TO SHARE THIS THIS IS AMAZING
trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50002 FOR ME AND FOR THEM
trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50003 MY KID'S 12 NOW THERE'S ANOTHER ONE AS WELL
trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50004 THE TIME I SPENT TEACHING THESE THINGS TO MY IN LAWS WAS A POWERFUL EXPERIENCE
trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50005 MY FATHER IN LAW NOT SO INTERESTED BUT THAT'S OK BECAUSE MY MOTHER IN LAW SHE SOAKED IT IN
trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50006 DOES SHE SIT AT THE COMPUTER ALL DAY
trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50007 MY KIDS WERE SIX AND TEN
trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50008 WE DIDN'T SEE IT COMING
trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50009 WE HAD NO LETTERS WE HAD NOTHING WHERE SHE SAID THIS IS EVERYTHING THAT I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER ME BY
trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50010 WE DIDN'T HAVE THOSE THINGS THAT YOU WISH YOU HAD
trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50011 BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAD
trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50012 A GIFT THAT I FEEL THAT EVERYONE DESERVES TO HAVE
trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50013 BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50014 HOW ARE WE GOING TO HELP THEM
trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50015 THAT'S UP TO YOU TO THINK ABOUT
trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50016 IT'S A THOUGHT PROCESS YOUR WHOLE FAMILY NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND
trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50017 WHY DON'T WE DO THAT ONLINE
trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50018 A HIGHER LEVEL OF DIGITAL LITERACY CAN HELP
trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50019 WE REALLY SHOULDN'T BE DOING THAT ONLINE
trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50020 THAT'S JUST IN THIS FIRST YEAR
trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50021 MORE AND MORE SERVICES REQUIRE YOU TO FILL OUT A FORM ONLINE
trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50022 HOW DO WE REALLY MAKE AN IMPACT
trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50023 BRING THE BIG FAMILY THANKSGIVING FAMILY REUNION IF IT'S NOT FAMILY IT'S YOUR TIGHT CLOSE CIRCLE OF
trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50024 WHAT MAKES YOU UPSET ONLINE
trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50025 I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE TOLD MY MOTHER IN LAW

trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50027 DON'T SLAM A FAMILY MEMBER OR A FRIEND FOR A CHOICE THEY MADE ONLINE

trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50031 QUIETLY NUDGING SOMEONE TO CHANGE THEIR PASSWORD BEFORE IT SPREADS TO ANOTHER FAMILY OR FRIEND
trainval/8xHrpO6p7dE/50032 IT WILL HELP YOU MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HELPING GUIDE OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS AND MAKING DECISIONS FOR YOURSELF
trainval/8XQ1onjXJK0/50001 SEE THOSE HANDS THERE
trainval/8XQ1onjXJK0/50002 THE GREAT THING ABOUT LEARNING CHINESE IS THAT YOUR CHINESE TEACHER GIVES YOU A NEW NAME
trainval/8XQ1onjXJK0/50003 SO THERE I AM IN THE EMBASSY IN BEIJING OFF TO THE GREAT HALL OF THE PEOPLE WITH OUR AMBASSADOR WHO HAD ASKED ME
trainval/8XQ1onjXJK0/50004 AND SO THE AMBASSADOR BEGAN WITH THIS INELEGANT PHRASE
trainval/8XQ1onjXJK0/50005 IT NEEDED TO BE A LITTLE MORE ELEGANT A LITTLE MORE CLASSICAL SO I RENDERED IT AS FOLLOWS
trainval/8XQ1onjXJK0/50006 THIS GUY IS AN AMERICAN
trainval/8XQ1onjXJK0/50007 WE LIVE NOW IN A WORLD OF INTERDEPENDENCE AND GLOBALIZATION
trainval/8XQ1onjXJK0/50008 IT COULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN
trainval/8XQ1onjXJK0/50009 LET ME FIRST GO TO IN FACT CHINA'S VIEWS OF THE U
trainval/8XQ1onjXJK0/50010 AND THE REST OF THE WEST
trainval/8XQ1onjXJK0/50011 INSTEAD WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE U
trainval/8XQ1onjXJK0/50012 AND THE COLLECTIVE WEST
trainval/8XQ1onjXJK0/50013 THIS IS WHAT OUR HEAD TELLS US WE NEED TO DO BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR HEART
trainval/8zj8HJntlP4/50001 I WANTED MORE OF ALL OF IT
trainval/8zj8HJntlP4/50002 I WAS A CHILD OF THE 80S AND 90S
trainval/8zj8HJntlP4/50003 ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THANK GOD FOR CURIOSITY BECAUSE AT 19 WANTING TO SEE THE WORLD I TRAVELED ABROAD TO INDIA WHERE I
trainval/8zj8HJntlP4/50004 WHAT'S MORE MY STUFF WAS LIMITED ON THAT SEMESTER
trainval/8zj8HJntlP4/50005 HOW I CAME TO BELIEVE OTHERWISE HAS BEEN AN EYE OPENING EXPERIENCE
trainval/8zj8HJntlP4/50006 MY BEDROOM WALLS WEREN'T GOING TO MAGICALLY EXPAND
trainval/8zj8HJntlP4/50007 I HAD TO CREATE SPACE WITHIN THE CONFINES I WAS GIVEN AND IT WAS A SMALL BEDROOM PACKED WITH
trainval/8zj8HJntlP4/50008 SO ONCE THE CITY SCHOOLED ME IN THE FINE ART OF DRESSING THE DECLUTTERING EXTENDED TO MY
trainval/8zj8HJntlP4/50009 I WAS RUTHLESS ABOUT IT AND THE RESULT WAS AWESOME
trainval/8zj8HJntlP4/50010 GONE WERE THE DAYS OF HEMMING AND HAWING IN FRONT OF A MIRROR WONDERING IF I LOOKED OK
trainval/8zj8HJntlP4/50011 THE 1950S ERA SUPERMARKET CONTAINED 3000 DIFFERENT ITEMS BUT BY THE
trainval/8zj8HJntlP4/50012 SO I JUST WANT TO ASK TWO THINGS OF YOU BEFORE I WRAP UP
trainval/8zw7AXwnb8M/50001 I DON'T KNOW WHO TALKS LIKE THAT BUT THAT'S JUST IN MY MIND
trainval/90mj79GqWhc/50001 AND ANOTHER MAN LOOKED IN MY DIRECTION AND SAID YES THERE HE IS
trainval/90mj79GqWhc/50002 HE'S ON THIS ELEVATOR WITH US
trainval/90mj79GqWhc/50003 AND THE BIBLE SAYS THAT DAVID LAID UP GREAT STORES OF IRON AND WHICH ARCHAEOLOGISTS HAVE
trainval/90mj79GqWhc/50004 IT'S THE PART OF YOU THAT YEARNS REALLY FOR GOD
trainval/90mj79GqWhc/50005 WHAT'S LIFE ALL ABOUT
trainval/93fJ33L9OKw/50001 NOBODY WILL EVER DO THIS
trainval/93fJ33L9OKw/50002 A LOT OF WEDDINGS AT THAT HOTEL
trainval/93hbqLBpSHI/50001 I WILL NEVER LEAVE
trainval/95MmftgCHMo/50001 IT S HORRIBLE TO THINK ABOUT
trainval/97MWOERYSdE/50001 HE DIDN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT
trainval/97MWOERYSdE/50002 AND SNOWDEN CAME UP WITH A SUGGESTION WHICH WAS AND I KID YOU NOT {LG}
trainval/97MWOERYSdE/50003 THEY MET WITH SNOWDEN AT THE MIRA HOTEL INITIALLY GLENN AND LAURA
trainval/97MWOERYSdE/50004 THEY WENT UPSTAIRS AND THEY BEGAN TALKING
trainval/97MWOERYSdE/50005 BASICALLY EVENTS OF THE BEGINNING OF LAST YEAR WENT INTO FAST FORWARD BY THE SPRING OF LAST YEAR SNOWDEN WAS READY TO DO THIS LEAK
trainval/97MWOERYSdE/50007 IN OTHER WORDS THERE'S A COMPLETE RECORD OF WHERE YOU'VE BEEN
trainval/97MWOERYSdE/50008 BUT HE IS ALSO A BRILLIANT REPORTER
trainval/97MWOERYSdE/50009 IF YOU GO TO YOUR PRIVACY SETTINGS YOU CAN FIND OUT IT'S ALL BEING COLLECTED
trainval/97MWOERYSdE/50010 AND THE THREE OF THEM FLEW TO HONG KONG
trainval/97MWOERYSdE/50011 REALLY IT WAS KIND OF A BADLY WRITTEN KGB DRAMA
trainval/97MWOERYSdE/50012 I THINK WE SHOULD THANK EDWARD SNOWDEN
trainval/97rrxS1yBU0/50001 NOW THREE LIVES WASN'T THE BAD PART OF IT
trainval/9aC7bUTBKv0/50001 OR IS IT MERELY PRESUMPTUOUS
trainval/9aC7bUTBKv0/50002 HE DID NOT RUN DOWN SHOUTING
trainval/9AgCr2tTvng/50001 SO KIND OF IT WAS THE WANNABE WRITER'S DREAM RIGHT
trainval/9ebJlcZMx3c/50001 BEFORE THAT I KNEW NOTHING
trainval/9ebJlcZMx3c/50003 SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I KNOW NOW
trainval/9ebJlcZMx3c/50004 WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THAT THAT IS ALL THE KNOWLEDGE YOU NEED TO FUNDAMENTALLY UNDERSTAND HOW YOUR MEMORY
trainval/9ebJlcZMx3c/50005 WELL WE COMPETE IN MEMORY
trainval/9ebJlcZMx3c/50006 I'M A MEMORY ATHLETE
trainval/9ebJlcZMx3c/50007 I THINK IT'S EASY IF I SHOW YOU
trainval/9ebJlcZMx3c/50008 WHAT DO YOU MEAN
trainval/9ebJlcZMx3c/50010 AND WHAT COMES AFTER HEARTS OF 10
trainval/9ebJlcZMx3c/50011 THIS ONE I WILL REMEMBER
trainval/9ebJlcZMx3c/50012 IT HAS A DOOR ON IT
trainval/9ebJlcZMx3c/50014 I MEAN YOU'VE NEVER BEEN INSIDE A SNAIL CELL
trainval/9ebJlcZMx3c/50015 THAT'S ONE OF THE EVENTS TO MEMORIZE WORDS
trainval/9ebJlcZMx3c/50016 I KNOW HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE JUST DID BEFORE
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50001 AND I LOOKED UP AND SAID WHO IS THAT MAN
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50002 AND THEY SAID HIS NAME WAS DR
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50003 MARTIN LUTHER KING
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50004 AND I SAID TO MY PARENTS I'VE GOT TO GO
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50005 I WANT TO GO
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50006 I WANT TO BE A PART OF THIS
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50007 AND THEY SAID ABSOLUTELY NOT
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50008 AND THEY DECIDED TO DO IT
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50009 IT SIMPLY MEANS THAT THEY BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO IT
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50010 AND AS A RESULT OF THAT EXPERIENCE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK WHILE I WAS THERE IN JAIL DR
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50012 ROBERT MEYERHOFF SAID WHY IS IT THAT EVERYTHING I SEE ON TV ABOUT BLACK BOYS IF IT'S NOT ABOUT BASKETBALL IS NOT POSITIVE
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50013 WE MARRIED THOSE IDEAS AND WE CREATED THIS MEYERHOFF SCHOLARS PROGRAM
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50014 AND WHAT IS SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THE PROGRAM IS THAT WE LEARNED A NUMBER OF THINGS
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50015 AND THE QUESTION IS THIS HOW IS IT THAT NOW WE LEAD THE COUNTRY IN PRODUCING AFRICAN AMERICANS
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50016 S IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING AND M
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50017 THAT'S A BIG DEAL
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50018 GIVE ME A HAND FOR THAT
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50019 AND THE NUMBER ONE REASON WE FIND QUITE FRANKLY IS THEY DID NOT DO WELL IN FIRST YEAR SCIENCE COURSES
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50020 WE NEED TO FIND WAYS OF MAKING IT HAPPEN
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50021 NUMBER ONE HIGH EXPECTATIONS
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50022 EVERY FOUNDATION MAKES THE DIFFERENCE IN THE NEXT LEVEL
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50023 HE RETOOK THE COURSE
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50024 SHE'S ON THE FACULTY TENURE TRACK IN PSYCHIATRY PH
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50025 SHE AND HER ADVISER HAVE A PATENT ON A SECOND USE OF VIAGRA FOR DIABETES PATIENTS
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50026 SO BUILDING COMMUNITY AMONG THOSE STUDENTS VERY IMPORTANT
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50027 THEY WERE LOOKING AT THIS AMAZING PROTEIN DESIGN
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50028 I'LL NEVER FORGET A FACULTY MEMBER CALLING THE STAFF AND SAYING I'VE GOT THIS YOUNG MAN IN CLASS A YOUNG BLACK GUY AND HE SEEMS LIKE HE'S
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50029 HE'S NOT TAKING NOTES
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50030 WE NEED TO TALK TO HIM
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50031 WHAT WAS SIGNIFICANT WAS THAT THE FACULTY MEMBER WAS OBSERVING EVERY STUDENT TO UNDERSTAND WHO WAS REALLY INVOLVED
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50032 YOU'RE EXCITED ABOUT LEARNING AND YOU WANT TO ASK GOOD QUESTIONS
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50033 AND WHAT WE LEARNED WAS THAT WE NEEDED TO THINK ABOUT REDESIGNING COURSES
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50034 AND SO WE REDESIGNED CHEMISTRY WE REDESIGNED PHYSICS
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50035 IF YOU DON'T KNOW IT THERE'S BEEN A 79 PERCENT DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF WOMEN MAJORING IN
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50036 WHEN I WAS A 12 YEAR OLD CHILD IN THE JAIL IN BIRMINGHAM I KEPT THINKING I WONDER WHAT MY
trainval/9EglK8Mk18o/50037 I HAD NO IDEA THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR THIS LITTLE BLACK BOY IN BIRMINGHAM TO
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50001 I SAID I'M GAY
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50002 AND I WAS RATHER TAKEN ABACK
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50003 I HAD THOUGHT OF DEAFNESS ENTIRELY AS AN ILLNESS
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50004 AND I SUDDENLY THOUGHT MOST DEAF CHILDREN ARE BORN TO HEARING PARENTS
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50005 THOSE HEARING PARENTS TEND TO TRY TO CURE THEM
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50006 AND I HATCHED THE IDEA THAT THERE ARE REALLY TWO KINDS OF IDENTITY
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50007 AND EVEN THOUGH SHE DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF EDUCATIONAL OR FINANCIAL ADVANTAGES SHE FOUND THE BEST DOCTOR IN THE COUNTRY FOR
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50008 AND HE ENDED UP ACHIEVING AT A LEVEL THAT HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN CONTEMPLATED BY ANY MEMBER OF HIS FAMILY
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50009 ONE OF THE FAMILIES I INTERVIEWED TOM AND KAREN ROBARDS WERE TAKEN ABACK WHEN AS YOUNG AND
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50010 IN THE TIME SINCE THAT ATLANTIC MONTHLY STORY RAN THE LIFE EXPECTANCY FOR PEOPLE WITH DOWN SYNDROME
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50011 DO YOU WISH YOUR CHILD DIDN'T HAVE DOWN SYNDROME
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50012 AND KAREN ROBARDS SAID TO ME I'M WITH TOM
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50013 BUT SPEAKING FOR MYSELF WELL I WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED 23 YEARS AGO WHEN HE WAS BORN THAT I COULD
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50014 TWO BEERS FOR THEM IS FOUR BEERS FOR HIM
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50015 TESTING IN HUMANS IS AROUND THE CORNER
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50016 AND I BELIEVE IN BOTH OF THEM
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50017 BUT I THINK IT'S A TRAGEDY WHEN ONE OF THEM DOESN'T SEE THE OTHER
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50018 SHE SAID I KNEW I COULDN'T GO IN THERE AND INTERRUPT HIM BUT I WENT HOME AND I LEFT HIM EIGHT MESSAGES ON HIS CELL PHONE
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50019 THIS IS WHAT WE HEAR WHEN YOU MOURN OVER OUR EXISTENCE
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50020 THIS IS WHAT WE HEAR WHEN YOU PRAY FOR A CURE THAT YOUR FONDEST WISH FOR US IS THAT SOMEDAY WE
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50021 AND THE FIRST WEEKEND I SPENT WITH THEM THE FIRST OF MANY I RECORDED MORE THAN 20 HOURS OF CONVERSATION
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50022 WE WERE SITTING IN THE KITCHEN
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50023 IF I HADN'T GONE TO OHIO STATE AND CROSSED PATHS WITH TOM THIS CHILD WOULDN'T HAVE EXISTED AND THIS TERRIBLE THING
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50024 AND MANY PEOPLE WERE ASTONISHED AND SAID BUT HOW CAN YOU DECIDE TO HAVE CHILDREN IN THE MIDST OF
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50025 AND I DON'T ACCEPT SUBTRACTIVE MODELS OF LOVE ONLY ADDITIVE ONES
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50026 SHE SAID THAT MIGHT MEAN THAT HE HAD BRAIN DAMAGE
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50027 IN SO FAR AS HE WAS EXTENDING THEM HE WAS DOING SO ASYMMETRICALLY WHICH SHE THOUGHT COULD MEAN THAT THERE WAS A TUMOR OF SOME
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50028 AND HE HAD A VERY LARGE HEAD WHICH SHE THOUGHT MIGHT INDICATE HYDROCEPHALUS
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50029 AND LIKE ALL PARENTS SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME I WANTED TO PROTECT MY CHILD FROM ILLNESS
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50030 AND I WANTED ALSO TO PROTECT MYSELF FROM ILLNESS
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50031 AND YET I KNEW FROM THE WORK I HAD DONE THAT IF HE HAD ANY OF THE THINGS WE WERE ABOUT TO START TESTING
trainval/9EVEmZ2cSes/50032 AND ULTIMATELY I FEEL THAT IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE TEST FLAME RETARDANT PAJAMAS IN AN INFERNO
trainval/9FCsyK4aRXQ/50001 AND THAT WAS A SIMPLE CHOICE OF DECIDING YES' OR DECIDING NO
trainval/9FCsyK4aRXQ/50002 I WAS AGED 29 AT THE TIME
trainval/9FCsyK4aRXQ/50003 THIS WAS THE ONE TRUE DEFINING MOMENT OF MY LIFE
trainval/9FCsyK4aRXQ/50004 I FIND MYSELF WONDERING WHAT KIND OF WORLD IS HE ENTERING
trainval/9fyjlxizLFI/50001 AND I NEVER FORGOT THAT AND TO THIS DAY I STILL TAKE THOSE WORDS VERY MUCH TO HEART AND
trainval/9h2dFSIsH0I/50001 IT'S FROM THE SENATE
trainval/9h2dFSIsH0I/50002 AND THIS FREAKED THE MEDIA BUSINESSES OUT IT FREAKED THEM OUT EVERY TIME
trainval/9h2dFSIsH0I/50003 SO WHEN THE AUDIO HOME RECORDING ACT OF 1992 WAS PASSED THE MEDIA BUSINESSES GAVE UP
trainval/9h2dFSIsH0I/50004 SO THEY WENT FOR PLAN B
trainval/9h2dFSIsH0I/50005 AND THE MAIN REASON IT HASN'T WORKED IS THE INTERNET HAS TURNED OUT TO BE FAR MORE POPULAR AND FAR MORE POWERFUL THAN
trainval/9h2dFSIsH0I/50006 WE ARE IN A WORLD WHERE MOST AMERICAN CITIZENS OVER THE AGE OF 12
trainval/9h2dFSIsH0I/50007 SOME OF THE STUFF WE SHARE IS STUFF WE'VE FOUND
trainval/9H38oQBw2HU/50001 THERE ARE OVER 200 KINDS OF CANCER
trainval/9H38oQBw2HU/50003 BUT IT TURNS OUT THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER FOLKS THAT WOULD BE INTERESTED
trainval/9H38oQBw2HU/50004 WHAT ARE ALL THE CHALLENGES THAT MIGHT GET IN THE WAY
trainval/9i7cGZadEV4/50001 WE ONLY CHANGED THEIR BEHAVIOR
trainval/9ijS6iMi9gA/50001 WHERE'S YOUR ACCENT MISS
trainval/9ijS6iMi9gA/50002 AND SO OUR STORIES OF GROWING UP IN POVERTY OUR STORIES OF GROWING UP IN TRAUMATIC
trainval/9ijS6iMi9gA/50003 AND THEN GETTING STUCK
trainval/9ijS6iMi9gA/50004 AND SO IN 1998 I DECIDED TO START GEMS WHICH IS GIRLS EDUCATIONAL AND MENTORING SERVICES KIND OF
trainval/9ijS6iMi9gA/50005 I WAS ORIGINALLY WORKING WITH ADULT WOMEN
trainval/9ijS6iMi9gA/50006 OK THIS IS THE MOMENT WHERE OUR GIRLS AND YOUNG WOMEN AND ADULT WOMEN BEGIN TO BE TREATED AS VICTIMS NOT AS
trainval/9ijS6iMi9gA/50007 AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'VE CONTINUOUSLY FOUND
trainval/9ijS6iMi9gA/50008 I CAME ORIGINALLY TO WORK WITH ADULT WOMEN COMING OUT OF THE SEX INDUSTRY
trainval/9ijS6iMi9gA/50009 WE DON'T LIVE IN THAT KIND OF COUNTRY
trainval/9jRkACywckE/50001 WE HAD TO CHANGE OUR CULTURE ABOUT INFORMATION
trainval/9jRkACywckE/50002 WE HAD TO SHARE
trainval/9jRkACywckE/50003 BUT AS I WAS TALKING TO MY INTELLIGENCE OFFICER I SAID WHAT DO WE DO
trainval/9jRkACywckE/50004 AND HE SAID WELL YOU FOUND THEM
trainval/9jRkACywckE/50005 WHAT IF THE ENEMY FINDS OUT
trainval/9jRkACywckE/50006 AND HE SAYS THEY'RE THEIR PERSONNEL RECORDS
trainval/9jRkACywckE/50007 I THINK THERE ARE TWO PARTS OF THIS
trainval/9KACXVScWS4/50001 IT'S ALREADY WITH US
trainval/9KACXVScWS4/50002 WE HAVE A PLAN WE THINK WE HAVE A PLAN
trainval/9KACXVScWS4/50003 CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT
trainval/9KACXVScWS4/50004 AND SO YESTERDAY IT WAS VERY INTERESTING TO MEET WITH THESE PEOPLE
trainval/9KACXVScWS4/50005 THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS
trainval/9KaMufF0rAY/50001 CONTRARY TO POPULAR OPINION THE BRAIN DOESN'T JUST SWITCH OFF WHEN WE GO TO SLEEP INSTEAD IT GOES THROUGH A
trainval/9KaMufF0rAY/50002 NOW INTERESTINGLY AS WE AGE OUR SLEEP PATTERNS ALSO CHANGE
trainval/9KaMufF0rAY/50003 SO WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF THERE WAS A WAY THAT WE COULD MAINTAIN THOSE SLOW
trainval/9KaMufF0rAY/50004 RIGHT NOW OUR RESULTS ARE VERY PROMISING SO WE'RE HOPING THAT IN NOT TOO MANY YEARS WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO OFFER A SORT
trainval/9KaMufF0rAY/50005 WE ALL KNOW WE LIVE IN A SLEEP DEPRIVED SOCIETY
trainval/9KaMufF0rAY/50006 AND THESE SYMPTOMS WERE THE FACT THAT THEY LOST THEIR MEMORIES THEY COULDN'T LEARN NEW THINGS AND THEY
trainval/9KaMufF0rAY/50007 BUT SUBSEQUENT RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT HE WAS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
trainval/9KaMufF0rAY/50008 INSTEAD I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING WHICH I THINK IS MUCH MORE INTERESTING
trainval/9KaMufF0rAY/50009 THIS IS HOW WE CAN MANIPULATE THE SLEEP THAT WE DO GET IN ORDER TO GET THE MOST OUT OF IT IN ORDER TO
trainval/9KaMufF0rAY/50011 PRESS AS MANY 4 1 3 2 4 SEQUENCES AS YOU CAN
trainval/9KaMufF0rAY/50012 IT'S HELPING US TO STRENGTHEN UP MEMORIES
trainval/9KaMufF0rAY/50013 IT'S CRITICAL FOR CREATIVITY AND FORMS OF INNOVATION AND I BET EVERYONE HERE HAS
trainval/9KaMufF0rAY/50014 LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU AN EXPERIMENT WHICH SHOWS THIS
trainval/9KaMufF0rAY/50015 IT'S BEEN SHOWN THAT IF WE TRIGGER SOME KINDS OF PROBLEMS WHILE PEOPLE ARE ASLEEP THEN THEY CAN BE BETTER
trainval/9KaMufF0rAY/50016 SO I'M SURE SOME OF YOU HAVE HAD A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE AT SOME POINT IN YOUR LIFE
trainval/9KaMufF0rAY/50017 YOU MAY HAVE BEEN MUGGED YOU MAY HAVE BEEN IN A CAR CRASH MAYBE OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO YOU THAT YOU'D REALLY YOU
trainval/9KaMufF0rAY/50018 INSTEAD OF JUST MEASURING OUR SLEEP WE COULD BE USING THE INFORMATION THAT WE NOW HAVE ABOUT
trainval/9kxL9Cf46VM/50001 I ENDED UP ON A CONSERVATIVE WEBSITE
trainval/9MegHiL93B0/50001 SO AFTER A FEW INSTANCES OF THIS STEVE HAPPILY BECAME SEVE
trainval/9MegHiL93B0/50002 THIS IS A SONG THAT I WROTE LAST YEAR
trainval/9MegHiL93B0/50003 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/9o2CRjTRKIA/50001 HE KNEW HE WAS DYING BECAUSE HE HAD ESOPHAGEAL VARICES OTHERWISE KNOWN AS INTERNAL BLEEDING
trainval/9o2CRjTRKIA/50002 AND THEY DROVE OUT TO SOME GREAT WILD UNKNOWN DESERT
trainval/9o2CRjTRKIA/50003 I THINK YOU'LL LOVE IT
trainval/9o2CRjTRKIA/50004 AND INSTEAD I SHOULD HAVE BEEN STUDYING FOR MY ACCOUNTING FINAL I HAD A C IN THAT CLASS I JUST BARELY PASSED IT IN THE END
trainval/9o2CRjTRKIA/50005 THE REASON I READ IT WAS BECAUSE ABBEY WROTE ABOUT THE DESERT SOUTHWEST THIS LANDSCAPE RIGHT HERE IN
trainval/9o2CRjTRKIA/50006 HE WANTED US TO GET OUT OF OUR HOUSES AND INTO OUR CARS AND TRAVEL THOSE LANDS
trainval/9o2CRjTRKIA/50007 AND THEN I STARTED READING OTHER AUTHORS DESERT SOUTHWEST WRITERS I READ TERRY TEMPEST WILLIAMS
trainval/9o2CRjTRKIA/50008 AND THIS WAS GREAT WORK IMPORTANT WORK BEAUTIFUL WORK BUT MY HEART WAS SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD THE ENVIRONMENTAL
trainval/9o2CRjTRKIA/50009 AND THEN ONCE I RETURNED BACK TO AMERICA I MOVED TO THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST AND WORKED FOR THE NORTHWEST YOUTH CORPS AND
trainval/9o2CRjTRKIA/50010 ALL BY CRACKING OPEN ONE SINGLE BOOK
trainval/9o2CRjTRKIA/50011 AND THEN IT FINALLY DAWNED ON ME
trainval/9o2CRjTRKIA/50012 EDWARD ABBEY AND HIS HIDDEN DESERT GRAVE
trainval/9o2CRjTRKIA/50013 I WROTE A BOOK
trainval/9o2CRjTRKIA/50014 THE SEARCH FOR EDWARD ABBEY AND HIS HIDDEN DESERT GRAVE
trainval/9o2CRjTRKIA/50015 AND THEN IT'S PART MEMOIR AS I ASK ABBEY NOW DEAD A GHOST MENTOR FOR ME HOW TO LIVE MY
trainval/9o2CRjTRKIA/50016 AND KEN SLEIGHT TALKED TO ME IN HIS HOUSE IN THE LA SAL MOUNTAINS OF UTAH ABOUT THE DAMMING OF GLEN CANYON
trainval/9o2CRjTRKIA/50017 HE CALLED IT LAKE FOUL
trainval/9o2CRjTRKIA/50018 SO THAT'S WHAT I DID
trainval/9o2CRjTRKIA/50019 MY BEST FRIEND HAUS STILL MY BEST FRIEND AFTER ALL THESE YEARS JOINED ME IN THE DESERT AND WE SPENT TWO NIGHTS
trainval/9o2CRjTRKIA/50020 I RESIGNED MY POSITION I MOVED TO NORTHERN VERMONT WHERE I MET MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE SARAH AND I STARTED ALL OVER
trainval/9o2CRjTRKIA/50021 ALL BECAUSE OF READING ONE SINGLE BOOK
trainval/9o2CRjTRKIA/50022 HE SHOULD HAVE SAID READ THIS BOOK
trainval/9o2CRjTRKIA/50023 SO WHAT ONE BOOK WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE
trainval/9o2CRjTRKIA/50024 THANK YOU SO MUCH
trainval/9o5jAaZn2p0/50001 THAT'S KIND OF WHEN A LIGHT WENT OFF IN MY HEAD
trainval/9o5jAaZn2p0/50002 DO I OR DON'T I
trainval/9OECsmMont4/50001 ALL THESE INCREDIBLE FLAVORS THAT I HAD NO IDEA EXISTED IN CHOCOLATE
trainval/9OECsmMont4/50003 THIS IS THE BASE OF WHAT WE MAKE A GREAT CHOCOLATE BAR FROM
trainval/9OECsmMont4/50004 FORESTERO GROWN IN A COUPLE OF COUNTRIES MOSTLY WEST AFRICA AND SENT TO INDUSTRIAL CHOCOLATE
trainval/9OECsmMont4/50005 SO WE'VE NOT ADDED ANYTHING TO IT
trainval/9OECsmMont4/50006 HE PLANTED HIS FIRST TREE IN 1958
trainval/9OECsmMont4/50008 BUT THAT'S JUST THE NATURAL FLAVOR OF THAT BEAN
trainval/9OECsmMont4/50009 THESE BIG BUSINESSES HAVE LEFT HIM BY THE WAYSIDE TAKEN A LOT OF HIS KNOWLEDGE FROM WHAT I CAN TELL
trainval/9OECsmMont4/50010 THREE US DOLLARS ROUGHLY
trainval/9OECsmMont4/50011 COCOA IS THEIR MAIN EXPORT SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM THAT THEY GET A GOOD PRICE FOR THEIR
trainval/9P73k8m3Ytw/50002 IT HAD A BUNCH OF INPUTS EACH INPUT HAD A WEIGHT COMBINE THOSE INPUTS WEIGHTED BY THESE WEIGHTS AND PRODUCE AN
trainval/9P73k8m3Ytw/50003 THEY BEGAN TO USE THIS KIND OF NETWORK TO LEARN HOW TO RECOGNIZE SPEECH FOR EXAMPLE
trainval/9P73k8m3Ytw/50004 THEY CLAIM TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT IN 8 HOURS OF TRAINING AND NOW THEY HAVE A ROBOT THAT CAN DO THAT
trainval/9P73k8m3Ytw/50005 THEY ARE THE WORLD'S LARGEST JOB CREATORS ABOUT 50000 NEW DIRVERS SIGN UP FOR
trainval/9P73k8m3Ytw/50007 OH MY GOSH WE BETTER DO SELF DRIVING CARS WE CAN'T RELY ON GOOGLE'S SELF DRIVING CARS SO THEY STARTED A RESEARCH
trainval/9P73k8m3Ytw/50008 IT BECOMES A MUCH BETTER PROPOSITION TO ALWAYS USE A UBER RATHER THAN HAD THEIR OWN CAR
trainval/9P73k8m3Ytw/50009 YOU CAN HAVE THE CAR APPROPRIATE FOR THE THING
trainval/9P73k8m3Ytw/50010 MOST CARS TODAY JUST SITTING IN A PARKING LOT OR SITTING IN YOUR DRIVEWAY AND THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING
trainval/9P73k8m3Ytw/50011 WITH SELF DRIVING CARS THEY CAN DRIVE ALL THE TIME SO MUCH BETTER USE OF THE HARDWARE
trainval/9P73k8m3Ytw/50012 RISK DYING YOURSELF OR SHOULD YOU RISK KILLING THE MOTORCYCLIST
trainval/9P73k8m3Ytw/50013 TODAY IF A PERSON'S FACE THAT IN THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT THEY WOULD MAKE A DECISION ONE WAY OR THE OTHER AND WE WOULD SAID
trainval/9P73k8m3Ytw/50014 IN THIS SITUATION WHAT SHOULD YOU DO
trainval/9P73k8m3Ytw/50015 DECIDED TO RUN INTO THE MOTORCYCLIST
trainval/9P73k8m3Ytw/50016 THEY ARE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT PEDESTRIANS
trainval/9P73k8m3Ytw/50017 IF THERE'S A PEDESTRIAN THEY WOULD DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO AVOID THEM
trainval/9P73k8m3Ytw/50018 THAT HAS LED TO WHAT PEOPLE HAS CALLING
trainval/9P73k8m3Ytw/50019 PEDESTRIAN CHICKEN IN MOUNTAIN VIEW YOU'LL SEE A GOOGLE SELF DRIVING CAR IF YOU'RE A PEDESTRIAN AND YOU'RE ABOUT TO
trainval/9P73k8m3Ytw/50020 IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO WORK IN THE TECHNOLOGY AREA
trainval/9qd36SQPxSY/50001 SO I AM A SPACECRAFT ENGINEER A SPACECRAFT OPERATIONS ENGINEER AT NASA'S JET
trainval/9qd36SQPxSY/50002 AND THESE ROVERS ARE OUR ROBOTIC EMISSARIES
trainval/9qd36SQPxSY/50003 SO WHILE SHE SLEEPS WE WORK ON HER PROGRAM FOR THE NEXT DAY
trainval/9qd36SQPxSY/50004 WE DIDN'T START OUT THINKING THAT WE WERE GOING TO NEED MARS WATCHES
trainval/9qd36SQPxSY/50005 YEAH NOT SO MUCH
trainval/9qd36SQPxSY/50006 WHAT TIME IS IT ON MARS
trainval/9qd36SQPxSY/50007 IT WAS JUST VERY CONFUSING
trainval/9qd36SQPxSY/50008 WILL I WAKE THEM UP
trainval/9qd36SQPxSY/50009 SO THIS ALSO WORKS FOR THE HOUSE FOR AT HOME
trainval/9qd36SQPxSY/50011 IS IT OK TO CALL
trainval/9qd36SQPxSY/50012 OK WE'RE GETTING READY FOR MARS TIME
trainval/9qd36SQPxSY/50013 SO THEY LIVED ON MARS TIME FOR A MONTH AND HAD THESE GREAT ADVENTURES LIKE GOING BOWLING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
trainval/9qd36SQPxSY/50014 AND SO HERE I WAS LIVING IN KIND OF THIS DARKENED ENVIRONMENT BUT SO WAS HE
trainval/9qd36SQPxSY/50015 AND THAT WAS BECAUSE AGAIN THIS EVENTUALLY BECOMES HARD
trainval/9qd36SQPxSY/50016 IT WAS A HUGE BONDING EXPERIENCE WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS ON THE TEAM BUT IT IS
trainval/9qd36SQPxSY/50017 ARE YOU AWAKE
trainval/9qd36SQPxSY/50018 AND I DECIDED OK SO HE NEEDS A MARS WATCH
trainval/9RMaD0Sk7hc/50001 THERE WAS ALSO A VERY COMPLEX STORY THAT POSITED THAT I WAS A PEDOPHILE AND I WAS RUNNING FROM STATE TO
trainval/9RMaD0Sk7hc/50002 I DID TRY AND TALK TO ANY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MENTOR SCHOOL DISTRICT
trainval/9RMaD0Sk7hc/50003 I WANTED TO HEAR WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE BULLYING PROBLEM IN THEIR SCHOOL
trainval/9RMaD0Sk7hc/50004 IDEALLY I DIDN'T WANT TO DEMONIZE THEM
trainval/9RMaD0Sk7hc/50005 TEENAGERS JUST DON'T TELL THEIR PARENTS EVERYTHING
trainval/9RMaD0Sk7hc/50006 SHE RECEIVED DEATH THREATS ON HER CELL PHONE AFTER SCHOOL
trainval/9RMaD0Sk7hc/50007 AND HER PARENTS WERE GETTING DESPERATE AND THEY WERE NOT GETTING HELP FROM THE SCHOOL
trainval/9RMaD0Sk7hc/50008 WHEN SHE WAS GOING TO BE HOMESCHOOLED SHE WENT TO THE MENTOR PRINCIPAL AND SHE ASKED IF I'M BEING HOMESCHOOL CAN I STILL
trainval/9RMaD0Sk7hc/50009 I FELT VERY UPSET
trainval/9RMaD0Sk7hc/50010 IN FACT I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S WHAT HAPPENS ANYWHERE
trainval/9RMaD0Sk7hc/50011 I REMEMBER VERY WELL WHEN COLUMBINE HAPPENED
trainval/9RMaD0Sk7hc/50012 NONE OF THEM WANTED TO TALK TO ME
trainval/9RTkZaX1cH0/50001 7 MILLION SPECIES
trainval/9RTkZaX1cH0/50002 THIS CAN'T HAPPEN ON MARS TODAY
trainval/9RTkZaX1cH0/50003 THE ATMOSPHERE OF MARS TODAY IS TOO THIN AND TOO COLD FOR WATER TO BE STABLE AS A LIQUID
trainval/9RTkZaX1cH0/50004 ATMOSPHERIC PARTICLES GOT ENOUGH ENERGY TO BREAK FREE FROM THE GRAVITY OF THE PLANET ESCAPING AWAY TO SPACE NEVER
trainval/9RTkZaX1cH0/50005 THERE ARE TWO WAYS IF WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE THINGS A LITTLE BIT
trainval/9RTkZaX1cH0/50006 THE SAILS MAY GATHER ENERGY FROM THE SOLAR WIND
trainval/9RTkZaX1cH0/50007 THE MAGNETIC FIELD MAY GATHER ENERGY FROM THE SOLAR WIND THAT ALLOWS EVEN MORE ATMOSPHERIC ESCAPE TO HAPPEN
trainval/9SGSSQssNj4/50001 THERE'S A LIKELIHOOD THAT YOUR PROBLEM WAS ACTUALLY SOLVED BY THOSE MATHEMATICIANS BUT I CAN'T BLAME YOU FOR NOT KNOWING ENOUGH MATH
trainval/9SGSSQssNj4/50002 I KNOW THAT THEY MEAN THAT THEY HATED IT AND THEY'RE DONE WITH IT AND THEY'LL NEVER HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT AGAIN
trainval/9SGSSQssNj4/50003 IS THIS ACTUALLY TESTING WHETHER I KNOW THAT 3 4 LIES BETWEEN 1 2 AND 1
trainval/9SGSSQssNj4/50004 DURING THE FIRST MINUTE WELL THEY WERE SLEEPING
trainval/9SGSSQssNj4/50005 THE SECOND MINUTE
trainval/9SGSSQssNj4/50006 THE NEXT MINUTE TEN BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING AWAKE I GUESS
trainval/9SGSSQssNj4/50007 IT CERTAINLY HAS AN UPPER BOUND
trainval/9SGSSQssNj4/50008 I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW
trainval/9SGSSQssNj4/50009 LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
trainval/9SGSSQssNj4/50010 AND SOMETIMES SOLVING A PROBLEM IS ALL ABOUT CHANGING YOUR PERSPECTIVE
trainval/9SqHrhrTktc/50003 FOUR AND A HALF HOURS ON THE TABLE AND EVERYTHING WAS DONE
trainval/9SqHrhrTktc/50004 WE DON'T NEED ANY OF THAT
trainval/9SqHrhrTktc/50005 SO IT REALLY IS GREAT
trainval/9SqHrhrTktc/50007 WE HAD TO GET GOOD QUALITY IMAGES FROM WHICH TO MAKE THE CAD MODEL
trainval/9SqHrhrTktc/50008 AND THEN WE REALIZED THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY A MIRROR IMAGE OF THE REAL AORTA
trainval/9SqHrhrTktc/50009 BECAUSE HE IS SO SUCCESSFUL
trainval/9SqHrhrTktc/50010 IN THE UK WE HAVE THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE AND CLINICAL EXCELLENCE
trainval/9SqHrhrTktc/50012 AND WE HAD TO GET PAST THE NICE PROBLEM
trainval/9SqHrhrTktc/50013 WE NOW HAVE A GREAT CLINICAL GUIDANCE OUT ON THE NET
trainval/9SqHrhrTktc/50014 I SUPPOSE THE FUNDING BUREAUCRATS ULTIMATELY HAVE TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER
trainval/9SQYDFiWnSs/50001 I'M SO THANKFUL FOR MY GRANDMOTHER AND THE LESSONS THAT SHE DAWNED UPON ME
trainval/9SQYDFiWnSs/50002 THE VERY NEXT YEAR THIS WOMAN MY GRANDMOTHER DIDN'T WAKE UP OUT OF HER SLEEP IN VIRGINIA BEACH
trainval/9SQYDFiWnSs/50003 SHE SAID WHAT
trainval/9SQYDFiWnSs/50004 WE LAUGHED LIKE KIDS LAUGH AT THAT POINT IN TIME
trainval/9SQYDFiWnSs/50005 MEANWHILE MY TEACHER MISS CHAMBERS THE LADY WHO TAUGHT ME POETRY AND HOW TO COUNTRY TWO
trainval/9SQYDFiWnSs/50006 SHE WALKS OVER TO ME VERY SLOW AND SULKY LIKE SHE'S LATE FOR SCHOOL FOR THE LAST TIME
trainval/9SQYDFiWnSs/50007 SHE SAID WHAT JOVAN
trainval/9SQYDFiWnSs/50008 SHE SAID WELL IT'S THIS PERIOD IN TIME WHEN PEOPLE WITH SKIN COLOR LIKE YOURS HAD TO DO THINGS AGAINST THEIR WILL
trainval/9SQYDFiWnSs/50010 FOR THE NEXT 40 MINUTES I SAT IN THE BACK OF CLASS WHILE THE REST OF MY CLASSMATES FOUND THEIR EUREKA
trainval/9SQYDFiWnSs/50011 SHE SAID FIRST OF ALL YOU CAN'T BE THROWING YOUR BACKPACK AT YOUR FATHER LIKE THAT
trainval/9SQYDFiWnSs/50012 ANSWER THE QUESTION
trainval/9SQYDFiWnSs/50014 WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE PART OF NATURE
trainval/9SQYDFiWnSs/50015 DO YOU LOVE THE OCEANS
trainval/9SQYDFiWnSs/50016 DO YOU LOVE THE RIVERS
trainval/9SQYDFiWnSs/50017 I SAID GRANDMA I LOVE THE MOUNTAINS
trainval/9SQYDFiWnSs/50018 AND EVERY BIT OF BLACK BOY BUOYANCY CAME STORMING BACK INTO MY CHEST
trainval/9SQYDFiWnSs/50019 THE VERY NEXT DAY AT SCHOOL WE HAD OUR PRESENTATIONS
trainval/9SQYDFiWnSs/50020 KATE DEPUTY STEPPED UP AND TALKED ABOUT THE DUTCH ROYALTY IN HER FAMILY
trainval/9SQYDFiWnSs/50021 I WAS TAUGHT THIS BY MY GRANDMOTHER MARILEE ROBERTS MAYS
trainval/9SQYDFiWnSs/50022 IN 1995 ON A FAMILY VACATION I WENT TO VISIT THIS PLACE FOR THE FIRST TIME
trainval/9SQYDFiWnSs/50023 SO I STARTED TO WONDER HOW MANY PEOPLE DID THIS WOMAN SET FREE
trainval/9SQYDFiWnSs/50024 HOW MANY DOORS DID YOU LEAVE OPEN
trainval/9UiK4llJOXc/50001 DID YOU EVER STOP TO THINK ABOUT HOW THOSE ITEMS OF INVENTORY ACTUALLY FOUND THEIR WAY INSIDE THAT BOX IN THE
trainval/9UiK4llJOXc/50002 AND I STARTED THINKING ABOUT IT AGAIN
trainval/9UiK4llJOXc/50003 IF THE WORKER IN STATION THREE DECIDES TO LEAVE AND GO TO THE BATHROOM IT HAS NO IMPACT ON THE PRODUCTIVITY OF
trainval/9usocDBGnvA/50001 BUT WHAT I HAVE LEARNED IS SOMETHING THAT IS VALUABLE FOR ALL OF US REGARDLESS OF THE WAY WE LIVE OUR LIVES
trainval/9uuhxGhD9bo/50001 IT DESCRIBES THE IDEA THAT OUR CONTEMPORARY SURROUNDINGS ARE CONSTANTLY CHANGING AND THEY HAVE BECOME
trainval/9uuhxGhD9bo/50002 SO FOR ONE OF MY RECENT COLLECTIONS I DEVELOPED A DYNAMIC TEXTILE THAT WOULD ENHANCE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE
trainval/9uuhxGhD9bo/50003 AND THIS KINETIC GARMENT CAN RESPOND TO THE SURROUNDINGS IN TERMS OF SOUND
trainval/9uuhxGhD9bo/50004 AND NOT ONLY DID I WANT TO MOUNT 600 OF THESE ON THE GARMENT I ALSO WANTED TO ADDRESS EACH DOT
trainval/9uuhxGhD9bo/50005 THERE ARE TWO THINGS WE ALWAYS HAVE WITH US WHEN WE LEAVE THE HOUSE
trainval/9uuhxGhD9bo/50006 WEARABLE SOLAR GIVES YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHARGE YOUR PHONE ON THE GO WHEREVER YOU ARE
trainval/9uuhxGhD9bo/50007 ONE OF THE MAIN ISSUES FOR INSTANCE IS THAT THEY'RE NOT WASHABLE
trainval/9uuhxGhD9bo/50008 SO WE ARE NOW LOOKING AT SOLAR HARVESTING FIBERS PRINTABLE SOLAR CELLS AND WASHABLE TEXTILE CIRCUITS TO UPGRADE THE
trainval/9uuhxGhD9bo/50010 NOBODY KNEW WHAT TO DO WITH IT
trainval/9uuhxGhD9bo/50011 THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I'M CURRENTLY RESEARCHING AS PART OF MY PHD PROGRAM CALLED CRAFTING WEARABLES AT THE
trainval/9vKRj9yV8pI/50001 IN FACT YOU WERE RIGHT
trainval/9vKRj9yV8pI/50002 AND BEING A NOW WHAT SOLUTION KIND OF GIRL I SAID SO NOW WHAT
trainval/9vKRj9yV8pI/50003 IT'S TIME TO STOP THIS EXPERIMENT
trainval/9vKRj9yV8pI/50004 AND IT'S REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE WE ONLY EVER REFERENCE THAT IN A VERY BASIC WAY
trainval/9vKRj9yV8pI/50005 FIRST YOU HAVE THE FOLLICULAR PHASE FASCINATING PHASE
trainval/9vKRj9yV8pI/50006 THE FIRST IS YOU HAVE TO FALL IN LOVE
trainval/9VOHt1oULJ0/50001 IT IS PHILOSOPHICALLY VERY INTERESTING TO REALIZE THAT ALL OUR CELLS ARE PROGRAMMED TO
trainval/9VOHt1oULJ0/50002 BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS FOR EXAMPLE FOR CHILDHOOD CANCER
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50001 AS LONG AS WE'RE ONLY OUTRAGED AT THE RAPISTS AND THEIR ACTIONS AND AVOID LOOKING AT THE ROOTS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE THOSE ROOTS
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50002 IT IMPACTS VICTIMS ACROSS IDENTITIES
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50003 THAT'S WHY TODAY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SEXUAL VIOLENCE AS A MEN'S ISSUE
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50004 NOW THIS CAN BE HARD FOR US AS MEN TO HEAR
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50005 IT CAN FEEL LIKE WE ARE ALL BEING BLAMED FOR THE ACTIONS OF A FEW
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50006 TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE THAT WE CAN PLAY IN ENDING RAPE
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50007 OF THE COLLEGE MEN WHO ADMITTED TO ALREADY HAVING ENGAGED IN BEHAVIORS THAT MET ONE OF THE 10 BEHAVIORS THAT MET THE LEGAL
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50008 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RAPE AND SEX IS INFORMED CONSENT AND INFORMED CONSENT IS SIMPLY THAT EVERY STEP OF THE WAY
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50009 WE'VE LEARNED THE SAME THINGS AROUND SEXUAL INTERACTIONS
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50010 AND WHAT IF THIS DIDN'T ABSOLVE THEM OF ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THEIR ACTIONS BUT MEANT THAT
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50011 WE'VE HEARD NO MEANS NO AND THAT'S TRUE
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50012 IF SOMEONE SAYS NO OR STOP YOU DON'T HAVE CONSENT
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50013 WE ALSO LEARNED IF YOU'RE UNSURE GO REALLY FAST
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50014 CAN YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO DRINK THAT YOU'RE NO LONGER ABLE TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION AND NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY THAT CONSENT NO LONGER IS
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50015 I WANT TO TALK ABOUT JUST FOUR ASPECTS OF THE RAPE CULTURE
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50016 FIRST THE OBJECTIFICATION OF WOMEN
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50017 AND WE SOMETIMES CHOOSE TO VIEW SOME WOMEN WITH LESS INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITY AND HUMANITY AND THAT CAN LEAD TO
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50018 WE CAN INTERVENE IN THE MOMENT WHEN WE SEE TWO HIGHLY INTOXICATED PEOPLE LEAVING TOGETHER
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50019 WHEN WE SEE SOMEONE WHO'S NOT TAKING CUES THAT SOMEONE ISN'T INTERESTED OR WHEN WE SEE SOMEONE IN A VULNERABLE POSITION
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50020 WE CAN INTERVENE LONG BEFORE THOSE MOMENTS AT THE ROOT CAUSES OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE THAT MAKE THOSE MOMENTS POSSIBLE AND
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50021 NOW CAN SPEAKING UP BE AWKWARD
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50022 AND IT MAY FEEL LIKE SAYING NOTHING IS PLAYING IT SAFE BUT SAYING NOTHING HAS ITS OWN CONSEQUENCES
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50023 WHAT IF YOU FOUND OUT THE NEXT DAY THAT WHAT YOU SAW LED TO SOMEONE BEING SEXUALLY ASSAULTED OR RAPED
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50024 BUT TOO OFTEN WE SAY TO COLLEGE MEN
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50025 THINK ABOUT FOUR WOMEN YOU KNOW AND LOVE AND THINK ABOUT ONE OF THEM BEING SEXUALLY ASSAULTED
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50026 IF THIS HELPS YOU CONNECT WITH THIS ISSUE THAT'S GREAT BUT FOR ME IT SELLS US AS MEN SHORT
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50027 FIRST OF ALL THAT MESSAGE OFTEN SAYS
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50028 20 YEARS AGO I HEARD CORNELL WEST SPEAK ABOUT RACE AND RACISM IN THIS COUNTRY
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50029 HE ENDED THAT TALK THEN BY SAYING HE WASN'T OPTIMISTIC BUT HE WAS HOPEFUL
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50030 HE WENT ON TO EXPLAIN THAT OPTIMISM REQUIRES EVIDENCE OF PROGRESS BUT HOPE REQUIRES NO SUCH EVIDENCE AND IS SIMPLY A
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50031 WHEN IT COMES TO SEXUAL VIOLENCE I FEEL EXACTLY THE SAME WAY
trainval/9VXOknUbzBM/50032 I HOPE YOU'LL JOIN ME
trainval/9X68dm92HVI/50001 I WAS QUITE EXCITED ABOUT THIS
trainval/9X68dm92HVI/50002 YOU KNOW WE WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND WE FEEL WE MAKE DECISIONS
trainval/9X68dm92HVI/50003 WE OPEN THE REFRIGERATOR AND WE FEEL THAT WE DECIDE WHAT TO EAT
trainval/9X68dm92HVI/50004 NOT YOURS OF COURSE OTHER PEOPLE'S
trainval/9X68dm92HVI/50005 SO I DECIDED TO TRY AND WRITE SOMETHING MORE FUN
trainval/9X68dm92HVI/50006 VISION IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS WE DO
trainval/9X68dm92HVI/50007 AND IF WE HAVE THESE PREDICTABLE REPEATABLE MISTAKES IN VISION WHICH WE'RE SO GOOD AT WHAT ARE THE CHANCES WE WON'T MAKE
trainval/9X68dm92HVI/50008 HOW MUCH DO YOU CARE ABOUT PEOPLE
trainval/9X68dm92HVI/50009 OR MAYBE IT'S ABOUT RELIGION
trainval/9X68dm92HVI/50010 THIS IS WHY WE HAVE THESE FOUR MINUTE DATES
trainval/9X68dm92HVI/50011 IT'S NOT BECAUSE IT'S TRIVIAL
trainval/9X68dm92HVI/50012 IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T CARE
trainval/9X68dm92HVI/50013 AND IT'S SO COMPLEX THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
trainval/9X68dm92HVI/50014 SO YOU REFER THE PATIENT FOR HIP REPLACEMENT THERAPY
trainval/9X68dm92HVI/50016 LET'S GO FOR HIP REPLACEMENT
trainval/9X68dm92HVI/50017 IT'S LIKE HAVING YOUR CAR STOLEN
trainval/9X68dm92HVI/50018 THE GENERAL IDEA HERE BY THE WAY IS THAT WE ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW OUR PREFERENCES THAT WELL
trainval/9XFeW9dgyIs/50001 THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PEAK FISH
trainval/9XFeW9dgyIs/50002 IF WE DO A FEW SIMPLE THINGS IN TARGETED PLACES WE CAN BRING OUR FISHERIES BACK AND USE THEM TO
trainval/9XFeW9dgyIs/50003 DO WE HAVE TO FIX FISHERIES MANAGEMENT IN ALL OF THOSE COUNTRIES
trainval/9XFeW9dgyIs/50004 FIFTY NINE PERCENT OF THE TUNA WE TESTED WAS MISLABELED
trainval/9XFeW9dgyIs/50005 AND RED SNAPPER WE TESTED 120 SAMPLES AND ONLY SEVEN OF THEM WERE REALLY RED SNAPPER SO GOOD LUCK FINDING A RED
trainval/9XFeW9dgyIs/50006 IT'S BEING DONE BY SOME IN THE INDUSTRY BUT NOT ENOUGH SO WE'RE PUSHING A LAW IN CONGRESS CALLED THE SAFE SEAFOOD ACT AND I'M VERY
trainval/9XFeW9dgyIs/50007 WE KNOW THAT WE CAN MANAGE OUR FISHERIES SUSTAINABLY
trainval/9XRPbFIN4lk/50001 ALL OF THIS ACQUISITION OF THE NEXT THING THE NEXT NEW VERSION
trainval/9XRPbFIN4lk/50002 ON MAGNETIC ISLAND WE WERE STAYING AT A LITTLE B AMP B AFTER TAKING A FERRY TO GET OUT THERE
trainval/9XRPbFIN4lk/50003 SOME OF US BUY CLOTHES SOME OF US BUY GADGETS MOST OF US BUY VACATIONS TO WARM PLACES JUST TO
trainval/9XRPbFIN4lk/50004 DID YOU EVER SELL ANYTHING THAT YOU HAD TO BUY BACK
trainval/9XRPbFIN4lk/50005 YOU WANT TO SWITCH JOBS OR WORK LESS
trainval/9XRPbFIN4lk/50006 BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE MONEY IN THE FIRST PLACE
trainval/9y7YEmyzSDo/50001 THEY SPEND SIMILAR AMOUNTS FOR PRIMARY AND SECONDARY PUPILS AS PERCENTAGE OF GDP PER
trainval/9y7YEmyzSDo/50002 THE SAD ANSWER IS NO
trainval/9y7YEmyzSDo/50003 WHAT ABOUT COUNTRIES WHERE WE WON'T HAVE ENOUGH QUALIFIED TEACHERS
trainval/9y7YEmyzSDo/50004 TAKE SOMALIA FOR EXAMPLE
trainval/9y7YEmyzSDo/50005 AND WHAT ABOUT CHILDREN IN REFUGEE CAMPS OR IN VERY REMOTE RURAL AREAS
trainval/9y7YEmyzSDo/50006 IT WORKS THIS WAY
trainval/9y7YEmyzSDo/50007 YOU KNOW SOME OF THEM RUN FOR OFFICE AND THEY HELPED RAISE THE STATUS OF THE PROFESSION SO THAT MORE STUDENTS
trainval/9y7YEmyzSDo/50008 AND WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS EXAMPLE IS BEYOND CHANGING THE PARADIGM OF THE TEACHER
trainval/9y7YEmyzSDo/50009 AND WE KNOW TECHNOLOGY IS NOT ALWAYS PERFECT
trainval/9y7YEmyzSDo/50010 AND YET FILIPE IS ONE OF OVER 300000 STUDENTS THAT BENEFITED FROM THE
trainval/9y7YEmyzSDo/50011 OVER 20 COUNTRIES FROM AFRICA AND ASIA HAVE COMMITTED TO MAKE EDUCATION THEIR PRIORITY AND TO
trainval/9y7YEmyzSDo/50012 WHAT THIS DOES IS BASICALLY TWO THINGS
trainval/9y7YEmyzSDo/50013 SO WE CAME UP WITH A SOLUTION TO HELP COUNTRIES ESCAPE THE MIDDLE INCOME TRAP COUNTRIES THAT ARE NOT POOR
trainval/9y7YEmyzSDo/50014 WE WILL SUBSIDIZE OR EVEN ELIMINATE COMPLETELY INTEREST PAYMENTS ON THE LOANS SO THAT
trainval/9y7YEmyzSDo/50015 TUNISIA'S NOBEL PEACE PRIZE IN 2015 AS THE ONLY DEMOCRACY THAT EMERGED FROM THE ARAB SPRING
trainval/9yEl0SbCA9M/50001 ONE BILLION PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TODAY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ALL SEASON ROADS
trainval/9yEl0SbCA9M/50003 THAT'S THE PART THAT WORKS
trainval/9yEl0SbCA9M/50004 THAT'S THE PART THAT'S BROKEN
trainval/9yEl0SbCA9M/50005 THESE FLY AUTONOMOUSLY
trainval/9yEl0SbCA9M/50006 THIS IS THE KEY TO THE TECHNOLOGY
trainval/9YeQi5Zqy1I/50001 BUT I FOUND THAT WE HAVE BIOBANKS
trainval/9YeQi5Zqy1I/50002 WHEN SCIENTISTS ACCESS THE DNA IN THESE BIOBANKS THEY DON'T GET THE NAME OR CONTACT
trainval/9YeQi5Zqy1I/50003 AND I WANTED TO TRY TO HACK IT AND TO SEE IF I CAN BREACH THE PRIVACY OF THESE PARTICIPANTS
trainval/9YeQi5Zqy1I/50004 SO MY LAB CONDUCTED AN EMPIRICAL TEST
trainval/9YeQi5Zqy1I/50006 THEY WANT TO FIND THEIR RELATIVES OR MAYBE MEET THE BLACK SHEEP IN THEIR FAMILY
trainval/9YeQi5Zqy1I/50007 AND EVENTUALLY WE FOUND A MATCH TO ANOTHER Y CHROMOSOME
trainval/9YeQi5Zqy1I/50008 WITHOUT BIOBANKS WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO HELP ARIELA
trainval/9YGZkgkj3fM/50001 IS THIS STILL THE CASE
trainval/9YGZkgkj3fM/50002 AND CAN THIS GENERATION OF PEOPLE REDEFINE THE PUBLIC'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ART
trainval/9YGZkgkj3fM/50003 GRADUALLY PEOPLE HAVE BEGUN TO PICK UP THE FRAGMENTS BENDING AND TWISTING IN THEIR OWN UNIQUE
trainval/9yPlMBPNf2M/50001 I BELIEVE WE CAN CHANGE IT FOR THE BETTER
trainval/9yPlMBPNf2M/50002 I HAVE TAKEN PART IN EXPEDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE BALTIC SEA
trainval/9YR8jNtV4BE/50001 AFTER ALL THE STELLAR REPUTATION OF THE COOL KIDS DEPENDS ON IT
trainval/9YR8jNtV4BE/50002 NO THAT'S TOTALLY NOT HOW THAT WORKS
trainval/9YR8jNtV4BE/50003 AND SO IT IS THEN THE DECIDEDLY COOL KIDS THAT DEFINE THE OTHERS
trainval/9YR8jNtV4BE/50004 OR JUST MAYBE EXPOSURE OR OTHERING COME THROUGH STATEMENTS THAT SOMEHOW SUGGEST YOU
trainval/9YR8jNtV4BE/50005 SO LET'S GO WITH IT
trainval/9YR8jNtV4BE/50006 DIFFERENT HOW EXACTLY
trainval/9YR8jNtV4BE/50007 THAT SAID LET ME REITERATE A FEW THINGS
trainval/9YR8jNtV4BE/50008 AND SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE HUFFS AND PUFFS ROLLING OF EYES SHIFTING BODIES
trainval/9YR8jNtV4BE/50009 AND SO AS A RESULT PEOPLE ARE LEFT COMFORTABLY UNKNOWLEDGEABLE UNAWARE AND UNABLE
trainval/9YR8jNtV4BE/50010 THIS IS HOW WHO BELIEVE THEMSELVES TO HAVE THE BEST OF INTENTIONS COME TO BE SURPRISINGLY
trainval/9YR8jNtV4BE/50011 AND THEN IF I COULD BE SO BLESSED ASSUMING THAT AFTER HAVING ARRIVED IN SOME
trainval/9YR8jNtV4BE/50012 YES THAT UNAVOIDABLE PLACE WHERE SOME HAVE AND MAY STILL VOICE
trainval/9YR8jNtV4BE/50013 THERE ARE NO TIMEOUTS SCHEDULED INTERMISSIONS OR CUSHIONY CONVENIENT MOMENTS FOR
trainval/A0V9Rk9tNL0/50001 IT'S LIKE THE BLOOD LIGHTS UP INSIDE YOUR VEINS
trainval/a0x0r7aPI2M/50001 SO WE WON'T RECEIVE ANY MORE INFORMATION BACK FROM THEM
trainval/a0x0r7aPI2M/50002 I WAS FASCINATED BY IT
trainval/a17Z5Sk2XJY/50001 FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS HE WOULD WEAR PROPER PANTS
trainval/a17Z5Sk2XJY/50002 BUT THEM I SAID OH PLEASE
trainval/a17Z5Sk2XJY/50003 THERE'S NOTHING I HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE
trainval/a17Z5Sk2XJY/50004 HE WAS ABLE TO GET DRESSED ON HIS OWN HE WAS ABLE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM ON HIS OWN THOSE JEANS
trainval/a17Z5Sk2XJY/50005 THERE'S ACTUALLY A PROFESSOR IN THE UK BY THE NAME OF KAREN J
trainval/a17Z5Sk2XJY/50006 BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHY OLIVER FELT SO ISOLATED WHEN HE COULDN'T WEAR WHAT HE WANTED TO WEAR
trainval/a17Z5Sk2XJY/50007 I THOUGHT WE WERE KINDRED CRAZY HAIR SPIRITS TOGETHER
trainval/a17Z5Sk2XJY/50008 AND SO I DID
trainval/a17Z5Sk2XJY/50009 THE MISSION WAS TO EDUCATE THE FASHION INDUSTRY THAT MODIFICATIONS COULD BE MADE TO
trainval/a17Z5Sk2XJY/50010 I KNEW THAT IF I WAS GOING TO MAKE A CHANGE IN THE INDUSTRY I HAD TO USE MY BACKGROUND
trainval/a17Z5Sk2XJY/50011 MAGNETS MADE OUR HARVARD FRESHMAN ABLE TO WEAR JEANS ON CAMPUS BECAUSE HE COULD DRESS
trainval/a17Z5Sk2XJY/50012 I BELIEVED THAT I JUST NEEDED TO EDUCATE THE INDUSTRY OF THE
trainval/a17Z5Sk2XJY/50013 CLOTHING CAN BE TRANSFORMATIVE
trainval/a17Z5Sk2XJY/50014 CAN YOU IMAGINE THE TIME AND MONEY SHE SPENT
trainval/a19lSbFPRqY/50001 IN OTHER WORDS WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO HAVE A GOOD THEORY OF MIND TO BE ABLE TO PUT ONESELF
trainval/a19lSbFPRqY/50002 CHOOSE OPTION A NOT B
trainval/a19lSbFPRqY/50003 THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE HIGH VALUES OF KAPPA
trainval/a19lSbFPRqY/50004 HOW WAS HER PERCEPTION OF THE WORLD DIFFERENT FROM MINE
trainval/a19lSbFPRqY/50005 THIS COULD BE PHARMACOLOGY BASED AND COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY BASED
trainval/A27QjpQSIeo/50001 THE TWO BIGGEST THINGS
trainval/A27QjpQSIeo/50002 OR FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY THOSE HUGE HOSPITAL BILLS
trainval/A27QjpQSIeo/50003 THEN THERE'S THE BIGGER PICTURE
trainval/A27QjpQSIeo/50004 WHO'S ORGANIZING THE COMMUNITY
trainval/A27QjpQSIeo/50005 I'M A SOCIAL WOKER WHAT'S YOUR SUPER POWER
trainval/A27QjpQSIeo/50006 WHAT'S YOUR SUPER POWER
trainval/A27QjpQSIeo/50007 WELL ONE YEAR SHE HAD A YOUNG WOMAN SHE ASSIGNED HIM TO A CLIENT NAMED
trainval/a2MR5XbJtXU/50002 WE LIVE IN A REALLY VISUAL CULTURE
trainval/a2MR5XbJtXU/50003 WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME IF YOU THINK ABOUT TWO WORLDS WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT THE OUTSIDE
trainval/a2MR5XbJtXU/50004 MAYBE ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN
trainval/a2MR5XbJtXU/50005 BUT WHEN YOU ASK A MAKER TO MAKE A CHEST OF DRAWERS THEY DON'T ALWAYS DO WHAT YOU THINK THEY ARE GOING TO DO
trainval/a2MR5XbJtXU/50006 THE LAST LESSON IS THE BIG ONE
trainval/a2MR5XbJtXU/50007 HE WANTED TO BE AN ORATOR
trainval/a2MR5XbJtXU/50009 WE'VE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DIAPHRAGM
trainval/a2MR5XbJtXU/50010 IT TELLS YOU ABOUT PRACTICE
trainval/a2MR5XbJtXU/50011 IN FACT SHE ALSO READ A POEM THAT SHE HAD WRITTEN WHEN THEY FIRST MET
trainval/a2MR5XbJtXU/50012 THE POWER OF PRACTICE
trainval/a2MR5XbJtXU/50013 PRACTICE IS THE WAY TO A GREAT INSTRUMENT
trainval/a2MR5XbJtXU/50014 YOU DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
trainval/a2MR5XbJtXU/50015 HE BUILDS HIMSELF AN UNDERGROUND CELLAR
trainval/a2MR5XbJtXU/50016 WITHIN YOUR BODY IS SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY THE KING OF THE BODY
trainval/a2MR5XbJtXU/50017 IT'S WHAT THE GREEKS CALLED THE CENTER OF ALL EXPRESSION
trainval/a2MR5XbJtXU/50018 PUT YOUR HANDS UP IF YOU THOUGHT ABOUT YOUR DIAPHRAGM TODAY
trainval/a2MR5XbJtXU/50019 THEN HE GOES BACK
trainval/a2MR5XbJtXU/50020 SUDDENLY I GOT IT
trainval/a2MR5XbJtXU/50021 I GOT HOW IT SHOULD FEEL
trainval/a2MR5XbJtXU/50022 HE GOES BACK TO THE ASSEMBLY
trainval/a2MR5XbJtXU/50023 ALL SONG IS OUR BREATH
trainval/a2MR5XbJtXU/50024 THE ROMANS UNDERSTOOD THIS
trainval/A3Vpjwye9Mw/50001 BUT VIDEO GAMES I WAS INSTANTLY CAPTIVATED BY
trainval/A3Vpjwye9Mw/50002 AND SO BEING IN THIS NEW WORLD WHERE I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY FRIENDS THIS GAVE ME SOMETHING TO DIG DEEP INTO
trainval/A3Vpjwye9Mw/50003 AND IT GAVE SOMETHING FOR MY SISTER AND I TO PLAY IT TOGETHER
trainval/A3Vpjwye9Mw/50004 THE WAY IT LOOKED THE WAY IT FELT THE WAY IT SOUNDED
trainval/A3Vpjwye9Mw/50005 IT JUST BEGAN TO SORT OF POPULATE THROUGHOUT ALL OF CULTURE BOTH GAMING AND NON
trainval/A3Vpjwye9Mw/50006 IT JUST IT WAS EVERYWHERE FOR A LONG TIME AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MIGHT'VE REMEMBERED THE LATE 70S EARLY 80S
trainval/A3Vpjwye9Mw/50007 IN 83 84 THE INDUSTRY WAS ALMOST NON EXISTED
trainval/A3Vpjwye9Mw/50008 SO I STARTED JUST FOR FUN I PULLED OUT 3 OF MY FAVORITE GAMES
trainval/A3yBxsDv8lM/50001 WHEN WE'RE WELCOMED WHEN WE'RE LOVED OPENLY EASILY OUR TRUST GROWS OFF OF THAT
trainval/A47JaOMDH4c/50001 I LET GO WITH THAT MESS
trainval/A47JaOMDH4c/50003 WE HAVE THREE HOUSEHOLDS THAT SHARE THE SAME GARDEN SPACE
trainval/A4KMN9W4pRs/50001 WHAT ARE YOU DOING
trainval/A4KMN9W4pRs/50002 ALL THIS SORT OF STUFF
trainval/A4KMN9W4pRs/50003 AND SO THE WAY THAT IT WOUND UP WORKING OUT IS THERE IS THIS VERY MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL ARRANGEMENT WHERE THEY ESSENTIALLY
trainval/A4KMN9W4pRs/50004 KEEP IN MIND AS YOU'RE WATCHING IT THAT THERE ARE NO GRAPHICS IN THIS THERE ARE NO CGIS NO
trainval/a4PUlSHZvf8/50001 I WAS IN THE WORSE PLACE I'VE EVER BEEN IN A RACE BEFORE
trainval/a4PUlSHZvf8/50002 IT WAS NOW OR NEVER MY PACER AND I AGREED
trainval/a4PUlSHZvf8/50003 MY BODY CAME ALIVE
trainval/a4PUlSHZvf8/50004 MY PARENTS WERE THERE TO SHARE THE MOMENT WITH ME
trainval/a4PUlSHZvf8/50005 AND SO PUSHED ME A LITTLE TOUCH MORE
trainval/a4PUlSHZvf8/50006 THEY KNEW IT WAS POSSIBLE
trainval/a4PUlSHZvf8/50007 I WANT THERE TO BE MORE SISU GIRLS IN OUR WORLD
trainval/a4PUlSHZvf8/50008 GIRLS WHO ARE BRAVE ENOUGH TO SIT OUTSIDE OF THEIR COMFORT ZONE
trainval/a4PUlSHZvf8/50009 MY FOOTSTEPS HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN EASY
trainval/a4ZBzM3L6ws/50001 WE EVEN HAD TO ADD SOMEONE TO OUR SCHEDULES WHO WAS THE PERSON YOU CALLED WHEN YOU THOUGHT YOU'D ARRIVED BUT THEN REALIZED YOU HADN'T
trainval/a4ZBzM3L6ws/50002 WE AGREED THAT ADDRESSES WERE BAD
trainval/a4ZBzM3L6ws/50003 WE THOUGHT IT WAS ESSENTIAL THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE THIS SYSTEM IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE
trainval/a5xR4QB1ADw/50001 WE CAN BEGIN TO ACTUALLY REFLECT ON A FORM OF HELPING WHICH STARTS WITH A FOCUS ON WHAT'S STRONG
trainval/a5xR4QB1ADw/50002 PEOPLE TELLING US THAT THESE ARE THE ASSETS THAT MUST BE IDENTIFIED CONNECTED AND
trainval/a5xR4QB1ADw/50003 IS A QUESTION THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ASK MILLIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE DAY
trainval/a5xR4QB1ADw/50004 THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN ADDRESS LONELINESS IS BY BUILDING COMMUNITY BY BUILDING DEEP
trainval/a5xR4QB1ADw/50005 OR INDEED TO HELP AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY
trainval/a5xR4QB1ADw/50006 ROSABETH MOSS KANTER THE HARVARD ACADEMIC PUTS IT BEAUTIFULLY WHEN SHE SAYS THAT WHEN
trainval/a5xR4QB1ADw/50007 SO OFTEN WHEN WE LABEL PEOPLE AS VULNERABLE OR AS DEFICIENT OR AS PROBLEMATIC
trainval/a5xR4QB1ADw/50008 MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY SEE LITTER WHAT THEY DO IS ONE OF TWO THINGS TYPICALLY
trainval/a5xR4QB1ADw/50009 HE INVITED THEM TO BRING THEIR GIFTS
trainval/a5xR4QB1ADw/50010 AND WHAT ROBIN SAID WHEN SHE ASKED THOSE QUESTIONS WAS HE WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT MAKING WALKING STICKS
trainval/a5xR4QB1ADw/50011 THE TWO ISSUES THAT THEY TOOK ON THE FIRST WAS THE FACT THAT THERE WERE STREET CHILDREN IN EACH OF THEIR VILLAGES
trainval/a5xR4QB1ADw/50012 THEY ARE IN A SCHOOL THAT LOOKS AS MUCH LIKE AN ECONOMIC HUB AS IT DOES A SCHOOL IT S A SCHOOL THAT IS FOCUSED
trainval/a5xR4QB1ADw/50013 THAT WAS HIS GREAT PASSION TAKING BRANCHES FROM FALLEN TREES AND CARVING THEM INTO WALKING STICKS
trainval/a5xR4QB1ADw/50014 ROBIN IS NOT A CLIENT IN A SERVICE
trainval/a5xR4QB1ADw/50015 I BELIEVE THAT THE SOLUTION TO THE MOST INTRACTABLE PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE
trainval/a6Qvzp516gY/50001 HE WAS STARING PAST ME AND JUST KIND OF LOOKING AT THE GROUND
trainval/A71OktxTPac/50001 ON ONE REALLY HOT SUMMER DAY ON A CAMPUS A PROSPECTIVE FAMILY WAS BEING WALKED
trainval/A71OktxTPac/50002 BUT I ALSO HAVE MOMENTS THAT DON'T MAKE ME PROUD OF MYSELF
trainval/A71OktxTPac/50003 ON THE WAY TO SCHOOL SHE SAT IN THE BACK IN THE CAR AND INSTEAD OF BEING THE HAPPY
trainval/A71OktxTPac/50004 JUST RECENTLY I COUNSELED A MOTHER WHO WAS COOKING THREE DIFFERENT DISHES FOR HER THREE CHILDREN
trainval/A71OktxTPac/50005 SHE WAS EXHAUSTED AND SHE FELT UNAPPRECIATED
trainval/A71OktxTPac/50006 I TOLD HER TO STOP
trainval/A71OktxTPac/50007 I HAVE FOUR
trainval/A71OktxTPac/50008 THE PARADOX IS THAT MORE THAN ANYTHING IN OUR LIVES WE WANT OUR CHILDREN TO
trainval/A71OktxTPac/50009 CHILDREN WHO ARE EXPOSED TO CHRONIC STRESS ARE PRONE TO MENTAL PROBLEMS SUCH AS
trainval/A71OktxTPac/50010 HE COULD HAVE MADE ME
trainval/A71OktxTPac/50011 THIS IS MY MEMORY OF MY FATHER AND MY
trainval/A71OktxTPac/50012 AND IT IS MY MOTIVATION TO NEVER GIVE UP
trainval/A71OktxTPac/50013 CHILDREN DON'T NEED A STRESS FREE LIFE
trainval/A71OktxTPac/50014 THERE IS NO PERFECT DAY OR MOMENT TO COME
trainval/A71OktxTPac/50015 WHEN WE DECIDE TO RUN A MARATHON WE DON'T RUN 42 KILOMETERS ON OUR FIRST
trainval/A71OktxTPac/50016 AN EXPERIENCE OF UNCONDITIONAL LOVE
trainval/A71OktxTPac/50017 AND A TRACTOR RIDE IT WAS
trainval/A71OktxTPac/50018 I HAVE COME TO BELIEVE IT'S THE ONE THING WORTH LIVING FOR
trainval/a7B39MLVeIc/50001 AND WE KNEW HOW TO FIX IT
trainval/a7B39MLVeIc/50002 PEOPLE ON THE OTHER HAND WAS A DIFFERENT SUBJECT
trainval/a7B39MLVeIc/50003 WE ALL WENT QUITE NUTS I WILL SAY
trainval/a7B39MLVeIc/50004 I LITERALLY WAS EATING THE SAME CARBON OVER AND OVER AGAIN
trainval/a7B39MLVeIc/50005 AND IT'S VERY IRRITATING
trainval/a7B39MLVeIc/50006 AND EVERYBODY OUTSIDE THOUGHT WE WERE DYING
trainval/a7B39MLVeIc/50007 I MEAN THE MEDIA WAS MAKING IT SOUND LIKE WERE WERE DYING
trainval/a7B39MLVeIc/50008 AND I HAD TO CALL UP MY MOTHER EVERY OTHER DAY SAYING NO MUM IT'S FINE FINE
trainval/a7B39MLVeIc/50010 NOT ME THAT WAS FOR SURE
trainval/a7B39MLVeIc/50011 WE STINK OF HAIRSPRAY AND UNDERARM DEODORANT AND ALL KINDS OF STUFF
trainval/a7B39MLVeIc/50012 AND I'M ALSO PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THAT YOU'RE GETTING A SNEAK PREVIEW ON FRIDAY WE'RE GOING TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY
trainval/a7B39MLVeIc/50013 IN A MANGROVE FOREST LIKE THIS I HAVE NO IDEA
trainval/a7B39MLVeIc/50014 AND UNDERSTAND ITS INTERACTIONS WITH THE ENTIRE EARTH
trainval/a7B39MLVeIc/50015 IT'S SUCH A HUGE SUBJECT
trainval/a7B39MLVeIc/50016 AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE SMALL STUFF COUNTS
trainval/a7B39MLVeIc/50017 AND I LET ALL OF THE LEAVES FALL FROM THE TREES THAT I HAVE ON MY PROPERTY
trainval/a7B39MLVeIc/50018 I'VE BEEN BUILDING TOPSOIL
trainval/a7B39MLVeIc/50019 AND SO NOW ALL THE BIRDS COME IN
trainval/a7B39MLVeIc/50020 AND I HAVE HAWKS
trainval/a7B39MLVeIc/50021 PEOPLE MUST HAVE THOUGHT I WAS NUTS
trainval/a7cDt5r2pGY/50002 SOME OF THE WORST ISSUES OF OUR TIME ARE CONNECTED TO IT
trainval/a7cDt5r2pGY/50003 AND FRESH WATER PLANET EARTH HAS A VERY LIMITED SUPPLY
trainval/a7cDt5r2pGY/50004 AND ALL OF US WILL BENEFIT
trainval/a7whovUoYu4/50001 WE MAY HAVE IT SOMEDAY
trainval/a7whovUoYu4/50002 IN FACT IT'S MUCH LESS TRANSMISSIBLE THAN VIRUSES SUCH AS FLU OR
trainval/a7whovUoYu4/50003 AND IN FACT WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD VACCINE CANDIDATES AVAILABLE NOW FOR MORE THAN A DECADE
trainval/a7whovUoYu4/50004 WHY IS THAT THOSE VACCINES ARE JUST GOING INTO CLINICAL TRIALS NOW
trainval/a7whovUoYu4/50005 WELL PARTIALLY BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT OR THOUGHT TO BE DIFFICULT TO WEAPONIZE THE VIRUS BUT
trainval/a7whovUoYu4/50006 AND THIS IS REALLY THE POINT
trainval/a7whovUoYu4/50007 AND VACCINES ARE OUR BEST DEFENSE
trainval/A9kQBAH1nK4/50001 AT HEARTMATH WE'VE DONE LOTS OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH TO LOOK AT HEART IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND TO
trainval/A9kQBAH1nK4/50002 HOW DOES THE FIELD IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW FROM THE ACCUMULATION OF ASSOCIATION WITH EACH OTHER AND ALL THE GREAT SPEAKERS HOW DOES THAT
trainval/A9kQBAH1nK4/50003 THAT WAS WHAT WAS MOST IMPORTANT
trainval/A9kQBAH1nK4/50004 SO I HAVE A WILLING VOLUNTEER THAT I MET BACKSTAGE JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO A BRAVE YOUNG WOMAN NAMED ALLIE WHO'S AGREED TO COME
trainval/A9kQBAH1nK4/50005 THE BOTTOM VIEW'S THE SAME PERSON A FEW MINUTES LATER
trainval/A9kQBAH1nK4/50006 WHAT HAVE THEY DONE
trainval/A9kQBAH1nK4/50007 THEY'VE SHIFTED FROM FEELING FRUSTRATION TO FEELING A HEART RELATED EMOTION
trainval/A9UmdY0E8hU/50001 IT'S SO EXPENSIVE TO HAVE THESE PEOPLE WORKING THERE
trainval/A9UmdY0E8hU/50002 BECAUSE THE WELFARE STATE AND THE UNIONS WORK IN TANDEM WITH CAPITALIST DYNAMICS
trainval/AA1BT0tfihw/50001 BUT THE QUESTION BECOMES
trainval/AA1BT0tfihw/50002 HOW DO I CONTROL THEIR INTERACTIONS
trainval/AA1BT0tfihw/50003 BUT I DON'T DO IT FROM AN ENTIRELY ENGINEERING OR MATHEMATICAL PERSPECTIVE
trainval/AA1BT0tfihw/50004 HOW DO YOU SOLVE THAT PROBLEM
trainval/AA1BT0tfihw/50005 THAT PROBLEM IS CALLED JAMMING AND THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT PLAGUES BATS OR SHOULD PLAGUE BATS AND ALSO ANY
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50001 SO AS FIREFIGHTERS WE HAVE TO USE ALL OF OUR WIT AND WE HAVE TO OUTWIT OUTSMART IT AND
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50002 AND WHAT WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING WITH PILLS AND PROCEDURES AND MORE LEGISLATION AND MORE DOCTORS
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50003 WHAT ABOUT CALCIUM
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50004 AND I SAID LISTEN AS FAR AS PROTEIN'S CONCERNED IT'S A BOOGIE MAN DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50005 I'M WEARING MY SHIRT INSIDE OUT
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50006 THE SCIENTIFIC TERM THE MEDICAL TERM FOR PROTEIN DEFICIENCY IS KWASHIORKOR YOU
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50007 CALCIUM COMES FROM THE GROUND
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50008 IT'S A MINERAL
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50009 IT'S NOT COWCIUM
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50010 I'M DOING IT ON PURPOSE
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50011 AND THAT'S PROBLEMATIC
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50012 SO IF YOU WANT TO SLAY THAT ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION DRAGON AND ALLOW YOUR PUFF THE MAGIC DRAGON
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50013 AND THEY SAY WELL HOW DO YOU DO THAT
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50015 NOW THESE GUYS KNEW THE PROCESSED AND REFINED FOODS WERE NOT HEALTHY
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50016 THEY KNEW ABOUT THE SUGAR AND THE POP AND THE FRIED CHIPS AND THE CANDY BARS
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50017 LET'S PICK ON OLIVE OIL FOR A SECOND
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50018 NOT ONE IOTA
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50019 AND SO I HEREBY DECLARE THAT YOU ARE ALL IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP {LG}
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50020 WE'RE THE ONLY ONES THAT HAVE THE UNMITIGATED AUDACITY TO GO THERE ALRIGHT
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50021 SO WE WOULD TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF LEMON JUICE AVOCADO SOME SPICES AND DRIVE IT IN
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50022 MOST FISH HAS MORE CHOLESTEROL THAN RED MEAT OR CHICKEN SALMON WHICH IS CONSIDERED THE HEALTHIEST
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50023 MOST AMERICANS ARE CONSUMING 5 TO 15 GRAMS OF FIBER A DAY
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50024 YOU START EATING PLANT BASED AND SUDDENLY IT GOES UP TO 30 TO 70 GRAMS OF FIBER AND NOW YOU'RE REGULAR AS A
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50025 DON'T GO THERE GUYS
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50026 AND SO THIS IS WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50027 I'VE SEEN MEDIA MOGULS LIKE OPRAH AND ELLEN THAT ARE NOW PUSHING PLANTS
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50028 I'VE SEEN CEO'S LIKE JOHN MACKEY AND BIZ STONE OF TWITTER AND BILL FORD OF
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50029 THAT ARE GOING PLANT BASED
trainval/AAkEYcmCCCk/50030 I'VE SEEN PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES LIKE SERENA AND VENUS WILLIAMS AND THE 1 RUNNING BACK IN THE NFL
trainval/AAsSqx2aLsA/50001 THESE GUYS ARE SOFT AND CHUBBY
trainval/AAsSqx2aLsA/50002 WE'RE UP AGAINST A PARADOX AGAIN
trainval/AAsSqx2aLsA/50004 AND YES WHILE USING THE THREE PATHS LET'S NOT FORGET LET'S ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND THE BASIC PRINCIPLE THAT LIES AT THEIR
trainval/AAxJL17gZhk/50001 AND I'M GOING TO SHOW EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU HERE TODAY HOW TO DO THAT
trainval/AAxJL17gZhk/50002 THAT'S REALLY SCARY
trainval/AAxJL17gZhk/50003 BUT SO WHAT
trainval/AAxJL17gZhk/50004 SOMEBODY HAS TO WIN RIGHT
trainval/AAxJL17gZhk/50005 AND YOU BURY IT SOMEWHERE IN THAT BATHTUB
trainval/ab9rJPjU4RM/50001 WE'LL CALL THIS THE SEVEN MINUTE PRINCIPLE
trainval/ab9rJPjU4RM/50002 AS I SAID ABOUT A YEAR AGO I STARTED REALIZING THAT I NEEDED TO MAKE A CHANGE
trainval/abMQhaMdQu0/50001 I SAID I DON'T WANT A JOB
trainval/abMQhaMdQu0/50003 WENT TO STANFORD THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO NORTHWESTERN
trainval/abMQhaMdQu0/50004 I WENT HOME AND ASKED DAD I SAID HEY DAD
trainval/abMQhaMdQu0/50005 I SAID WHY NOT
trainval/abMQhaMdQu0/50006 THAT'S KIND OF INTERESTING
trainval/abMQhaMdQu0/50008 WHEN I WAS NINE YEARS OLD I CROSSED AND WENT TO MY RICH DAD'S OFFICE BEING AN ENTREPRENEUR HE STARTED TEACHING HIS
trainval/abMQhaMdQu0/50009 THIS IS FINANCIAL LITERACY
trainval/abMQhaMdQu0/50010 HOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND NUMBERS
trainval/abMQhaMdQu0/50011 NOW YOU HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL TO BE A DOCTOR A LAWYER AN ENGINEER BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL TO BE RICH
trainval/abMQhaMdQu0/50012 SO ALL OVER THE WORLD TODAY I ASKED WHAT DR
trainval/abMQhaMdQu0/50014 WE'RE JUST LITTLE PEOPLE IN MANY WAYS
trainval/abMQhaMdQu0/50015 THAT'S A LIE
trainval/abMQhaMdQu0/50016 THEY BAILED OUT THE RICH
trainval/abMQhaMdQu0/50017 BUT IT WAS A GREAT LEARNING EXPERIENCE
trainval/abMQhaMdQu0/50018 YOU MAKE MISTAKES YOU'RE CONSIDERED STUPID
trainval/abMQhaMdQu0/50019 SO A PERSON HAS GOT TO FIND A PLACE TO MAKE MISTAKES
trainval/abMQhaMdQu0/50022 THEN THEY ARE TURNING PRO
trainval/abMQhaMdQu0/50023 YOU CAN'T LEARN TO RIDE A BICYCLE UNTIL YOU FALL OFF THE BICYCLE
trainval/abMQhaMdQu0/50024 THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS WHEN THEY LEAVE SCHOOL EVEN COLLEGE GRADUATES
trainval/abMQhaMdQu0/50025 THE REASON I CAN BORROW HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
trainval/abMQhaMdQu0/50026 EVERY TIME YOU SAY YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT AND YOU SAY I'M A POOR I'M A LOSER I CAN'T DO SOMETHING I'M HELPLESS THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD TAKE
trainval/AbqsMDfX9Ig/50001 WELL CLOSE UP ON AN EMOTION ON A CHARACTER'S FACE THE PROTAGONIST BEGIN TO PULL BACK AS THE MUSIC
trainval/AbqsMDfX9Ig/50002 OR PUT A POEM UP ON THE SCREEN AND HAVE US TRANSLATE IT ONLY PROBLEM IS THE POEM WOULD BE IN A LANGUAGE
trainval/AbqsMDfX9Ig/50003 EVERYONE HAS A SMARTPHONE AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS REMIXING MASHING UP AND THEN SPITTING BACK
trainval/AbqsMDfX9Ig/50004 SHE CAN OPEN A CAN OF SODA SHE CAN SHE HAS MANY TALENTS SHE CAN CHUG THE CAN OF SODA AND THEN SHE CAN
trainval/AbqsMDfX9Ig/50005 MAYBE THEY WANT TO KEEP GROWING BUT MAN S TOO IGNORANT TO STOP MOWING SO LAWNS ARE CUT EACH
trainval/AbqsMDfX9Ig/50006 YOU HAVE AN IDEA AND YOU SHARE IT WITH SOMEONE SOMEONE HAS AN IDEA AND THEY SHARE IT WITH YOU YOU SHARE IT WITH OTHER PEOPLE IT GETS BOUNCED AROUND
trainval/AbqsMDfX9Ig/50007 ELIOT IS NOT AS YOU MAY THINK ROLLING OVER IN HIS GRAVE THAT I'M UP HERE FROM MTV ON THE TED
trainval/ac1mOswXxLs/50001 AND AT THE UNIVERSITY I DO DISABILITY SERVICES
trainval/ac1mOswXxLs/50002 AND I WORK WITH STUDENTS WHO ALSO HAVE DISABILITIES AND HELP THEM SET UP ACCOMMODATION PLANS SO THAT THEY CAN BE
trainval/ac1mOswXxLs/50003 AND MY MASTERPIECE IN MY LIFE IS ACTUALLY MY DEAFNESS
trainval/ac1mOswXxLs/50004 IT SOUNDS A LOT WEIRDER WHEN I SAY THAT OUT LOUD
trainval/ac1mOswXxLs/50006 YOU KNOW MAYBE IT WASN'T THE SAME AS WHAT WE ALL ENVISIONED BUT IT WAS HIS OWN ACCOMMODATION TOOL
trainval/ac1mOswXxLs/50007 I COULD HAVE GONE IN ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND OFTENTIMES I DID
trainval/ac1mOswXxLs/50008 I WAS BROUGHT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND AT THE EMERGENCY ROOM MY PARENTS WERE TOLD BY THE DOCTORS TO START PREPARING FOR THE
trainval/ac1mOswXxLs/50009 IT JUST WAS LIKE A TON OF BRICKS THAT WERE DROPPED ON MY CHEST
trainval/ac1mOswXxLs/50010 I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WHERE TO GO
trainval/ac1mOswXxLs/50011 COLLEGE WAS A GAME CHANGER FOR ME
trainval/ac1mOswXxLs/50012 AT THE SAME TIME I BLOSSOMED
trainval/ac1mOswXxLs/50013 I WANTED TO FIND OUT WHAT I WANTED TO DO WITH MY LIFE
trainval/ac1mOswXxLs/50014 SO I STARTED WORKING FOR THIS NONPROFIT RESOURCE CENTER FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND I TOOK ONE INTERNSHIP
trainval/ac1mOswXxLs/50015 AND SO I TOOK MY OWN ADVICE AND I STARTED SHARING IT WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND SAYING SOMETIMES SELF ACCOMMODATION
trainval/ac1mOswXxLs/50016 AND SO I TALKED TO MY FRIENDS AND I SAID IS THIS OKAY FOR ME TO DO
trainval/ac1mOswXxLs/50017 WOULD YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS
trainval/acikxzM6GaY/50001 WHEN OUR GOVERNMENTS FRAME SLUMS AS THREATS IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY VIOLENT LAND GRABS OR FORCED EVICTIONS THEY'RE COUNTING ON THOSE
trainval/acJscdoP2a4/50001 WE'RE CUTTING DOWN OUR MAGNIFICENT RAIN FOREST AT THE RATE OF ONE ACRE PER SECOND FOR SOY BEANS TO FEED CATTLE CHICKENS
trainval/acJscdoP2a4/50002 MY MOTIVATION TO GO VEG WAS NOT HEALTH
trainval/acJscdoP2a4/50003 THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS I DIDN'T KNOW A SINGLE OTHER VEGETARIAN
trainval/acJscdoP2a4/50004 MY DIET WAS REASONABLY GOOD BUT NOT OPTIMAL
trainval/acJscdoP2a4/50005 MY FATHER MIGHT BE CONSIDERED WEIRD
trainval/acJscdoP2a4/50006 AND BEST OF ALL MY SPIRITUAL CONNECTION BECAME MUCH STRONGER
trainval/acJscdoP2a4/50007 LADIES HOW EASY IS IT TO BREAK A NAIL
trainval/acJscdoP2a4/50008 WOULD SHE BE OVERCOME WITH JOY AND WANT TO CUDDLE THAT BUNNY
trainval/acJscdoP2a4/50009 WE CERTAINLY HAVE PLENTY OF OTHER OPTIONS THESE DAYS
trainval/acJscdoP2a4/50010 HE CALLS IT THE CANARY IN THE COALMINE
trainval/acJscdoP2a4/50011 IT TURNS OUT IT'S ALL ABOUT BLOOD FLOW
trainval/acJscdoP2a4/50012 ANIMAL FOODS CLOG THE ARTERIES
trainval/acJscdoP2a4/50013 WHY IS THAT
trainval/acJscdoP2a4/50014 WE'RE GROWING ENOUGH FOOD TO FEED MORE THAN TWICE THE POPULATION OF ALL THE HUMAN BEINGS IN THE WORLD
trainval/acJscdoP2a4/50015 SOME PEOPLE SAY THE VEGAN LIFESTYLE DOESN'T WORK FOR THEIR BODIES
trainval/acJscdoP2a4/50016 HAVE THEY REALLY TRIED ALL 20000 PLANT FOODS BEFORE GIVING UP
trainval/acJscdoP2a4/50017 ONCE UPON A TIME SLAVERY WAS NORMAL AND IT WAS COMMONLY BELIEVED THAT THE EARTH WAS FLAT
trainval/acJscdoP2a4/50018 PLENTY OF PLANT FOODS ARE PERFECT JUST AS THEY ARE
trainval/acJscdoP2a4/50019 EVEN A CUCUMBER'S EASY TO EAT ON THE RUN
trainval/acJscdoP2a4/50020 JUST WASH IT AND BITE INTO IT AS IT IS
trainval/acJscdoP2a4/50021 OR MAKE A SAVORY BLENDED GREEN SOUP
trainval/acJscdoP2a4/50022 IT'S GREAT TO HAVE SUPPORT
trainval/acNGOQO7URc/50001 LATER ON HUNGARIAN COMPOSER B LA BART K SPENT YEARS TRAVELING IN THE EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRYSIDE
trainval/Acsv55lctGY/50001 WOW YOU CAN DO THAT ON ACCORDION
trainval/AdHSwXl2nuQ/50001 AND SO WE DID EXACTLY THAT
trainval/AdHSwXl2nuQ/50002 WE HAD THOUSANDS OF CLICKS HUNDREDS OF E MAILS
trainval/adijpJHdWIU/50001 A GOOD FAIRY TURNED HIM INTO A REAL BOY
trainval/AE0gO5wSaok/50001 I CANNOT FORGET THEM
trainval/AE0gO5wSaok/50002 HE WOULD SCREAM
trainval/AE0gO5wSaok/50004 THOSE CRIMES SHOULD NOT GO UNPUNISHED
trainval/AE0gO5wSaok/50005 I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO LOSE THE PROTECTION OF MY COUNTRY
trainval/AE0gO5wSaok/50006 THEY HAVE HELPED ME OVER THE YEARS TO COME OUT OF THE DARKNESS
trainval/AE0gO5wSaok/50007 I'VE LOST THAT COUNT
trainval/aEa11FZwTRY/50001 BUT IN PARTICULAR WHAT HE FOCUSED ON WAS THE PROBLEM WITH EDUCATION
trainval/aEa11FZwTRY/50002 WE PUT TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON OUR KIDS IN TERMS OF UNIVERSITY AND ENTRANCE AND ALL THAT STUFF
trainval/aEa11FZwTRY/50003 SO WHAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU OVER THE NEXT TEN MINUTES OR SO IS WHAT I HAVE DISCOVERED
trainval/aEa11FZwTRY/50004 WHAT I'VE DISCOVERED FROM THE RESEARCH BUT NOT JUST WHAT I'VE DISCOVERED FROM THE RESEARCH WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY PRACTICING IN OUR HOME
trainval/aEa11FZwTRY/50005 NOW WHAT'S THE PROBLEM A BIG PROBLEM WITH MODERN SOCIETY IS THAT WE HAVE THE TOY INDUSTRIES AND THE ENTERTAINMENT
trainval/aEa11FZwTRY/50006 OF COURSE WE SHOULD
trainval/aEa11FZwTRY/50007 AND THEY CONSTRUCT STUFF
trainval/aEa11FZwTRY/50008 NOW WHAT DOES THAT NUMBER REPRESENT
trainval/aEa11FZwTRY/50009 WHAT THAT NUMBER ACTUALLY REPRESENTS IS THE MOST WATCHED TED TALK OF ALL TIME BECAUSE THAT'S HOW MANY VIEWS SIR KEN
trainval/aEa11FZwTRY/50010 WE SHOULD ALLOW FOR THOSE MULTI DAY PLAY ACTIVITIES
trainval/aEa11FZwTRY/50011 WE PLAN EVERYTHING FOR THEM AND IN FACT WHAT CHILDREN NEED IS UNSTRUCTURED TIME
trainval/aEa11FZwTRY/50012 HE SPOKE ABOUT EDUCATION
trainval/aEa11FZwTRY/50013 GAMING IS VERY INTERESTING
trainval/aEa11FZwTRY/50014 I READ A PAPER RECENTLY ABOUT GAMING
trainval/aEa11FZwTRY/50015 NOW THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE HERE BECAUSE IN OUR HOUSE WHAT WE DO IS WE CELEBRATE CREATIVITY
trainval/aEa11FZwTRY/50016 IN THE BOOKCASE I'M A BIG FAN OF BANSKY THE GRAFFITI ARTIST THERE'RE BOOKS ABOUT BANSKY
trainval/aEa11FZwTRY/50017 I TALKED TO HANNAH ABOUT THE MEANING OF THAT ART
trainval/aEa11FZwTRY/50018 NOW THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE IMPORTANT HERE AND THAT IS DIVERGENT THINKING
trainval/aEa11FZwTRY/50019 THE ANSWER IS A HOLE
trainval/aEa11FZwTRY/50020 WHEN DO WE GET THAT RUSH OF OXYTOCIN IT'S WHEN WE'RE IN DEEPLY LOVING AFFECTIONATE RELATIONSHIPS
trainval/aEa11FZwTRY/50021 IT'S ALSO PARENTS THAT KILL CREATIVITY
trainval/aeiSXpmMQys/50001 BUT WE LOVE TO HAVE A BIG ONE
trainval/aeiSXpmMQys/50002 I'M AT THE POINT NOW WHERE I CAN'T HEAR OR SEE
trainval/aeiSXpmMQys/50003 THERE WASN'T ANYBODY STANDING BEHIND ME
trainval/aeiSXpmMQys/50004 AND SO THIS IS KIND OF JUST A CONVERSATION WITH THE CROWD
trainval/aeiSXpmMQys/50005 THEY ALWAYS SAY IT'S THE BEST
trainval/aeiSXpmMQys/50006 WE'RE ALL LUCKY
trainval/aeiSXpmMQys/50007 WE'RE LUCKY TO BE FROM OKLAHOMA
trainval/aeiSXpmMQys/50008 ALL YOU FROM OKLAHOMA CITY AND TULSA TOO BAD
trainval/aeiSXpmMQys/50009 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF YOU'D HAVE BEEN FROM A SMALL TOWN
trainval/aeiSXpmMQys/50010 AND NOW UNUSUAL FOR MOST BOYS BUT NOW MY DAD WAS NOT ONLY MY
trainval/aeiSXpmMQys/50011 HE SAID SON YOU'VE NEVER HAD A PLAN AND THEN HE SAID A FOOL WITH A PLAN CAN BEAT A
trainval/aeiSXpmMQys/50012 BY GOLLY HE SAID YOU'LL BE OUT OF HERE IN JUNE OF 51
trainval/aeiSXpmMQys/50013 AND THEN INTERESTINGLY BRIAN'S FROM BARTLESVILLE
trainval/aeiSXpmMQys/50014 MY FIRST JOB WAS IN BARTLESVILLE
trainval/aeiSXpmMQys/50015 AND HE SAID GOOD LUCK
trainval/aeiSXpmMQys/50016 AND I'VE ENJOYED GIVING IT
trainval/aeiSXpmMQys/50017 HE COULD PLAY THE BIG TIME
trainval/aeiSXpmMQys/50018 AND SOMEBODY WOULD SAY ED PLAY UP
trainval/aeiSXpmMQys/50019 I HAVE BEEN GENEROUS
trainval/aeiSXpmMQys/50020 I'VE BEEN WEALTHY
trainval/aeiSXpmMQys/50021 I'VE HAD THE MONEY TO GIVE
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50001 A TOLLGATE IS A BARRIER THAT STOPS PEOPLE FROM MOVING FORWARD AND THINGS LIKE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY OR THE ABILITY TO
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50002 THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN STUCK EARLY ON ARE NOW FALLING FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND THOSE WHO ARE AT THE FRONT
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50003 2 MILLION HOUSEHOLDS ARE NOW HOOKED UP TO THE WEB
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50004 BUT ONLY 26 OF THOSE ON THE LOWEST INCOMES
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50005 AND IN THE SAME BREATH THEY RECKON THAT ABOUT 16 MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY LACK BASIC ONLINE
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50006 BUT TO HAVE THE GOOGLE APP YOU HAVE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50007 YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SMARTPHONE TO BE ABLE TO USE IT
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50008 AND ALSO THE EDUCATION ABOUT HOW A SMARTPHONE WORKS
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50009 SO KNOWLEDGE IS ALWAYS WITHIN REACH IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THOSE THINGS
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50010 AND THAT REALLY GOT ME THINKING
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50011 THE PRINCIPLE OF CHANGING OUR BELIEFS BASED ON WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE WORLD IS NOTHING NEW THE WORLD GOES THROUGH THIS CHANGE
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50012 AND INVOLVED A LOT OF HARD WORK TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50013 IN THESE PROGRESSIONS THEY WERE VERY LABOUR INTENSIVE AND IT WOULD TAKE MANY YEARS TO BECOME ESTABLISHED AT WHAT YOU WERE
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50014 BUT ONCE YOU DID YOU WOULD HAVE A CAREER FOR LIFE
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50015 WE NEED TO START TO THINK ABOUT THE HUMAN IMPLICATIONS OF THIS CHANGE
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50016 FOR SOMEONE WHO CAN'T DRIVE I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT ONE
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50017 AND THESE SKILLS AND TRADES ARE ALL IN THE PROCESS OF HAVING PRODUCTION SLOWLY MOVED AWAY FROM PEOPLE AND SLOWLY BEGINNING TO CHANGE THE
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50018 YOU'D HAVE LOW PAID YOU'D HAVE HIGH PAID AND YOU'D HAVE YOUR MIDDLE PAID
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50019 THE MIDDLE SECTION WOULD CONTAIN JOBS LIKE BOOK KEEPING CLERICAL WORK AND THESE WOULD PROVIDE TYPICALLY
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50021 WE NEED TO START LOOKING AT HOW TO DRIVE A SHIFT IN PRINCIPLES AND BELIEFS FOR THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50022 WE NEED TO PREPARE YOUNG PEOPLE TO TAKE THEIR PLACE IN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50023 AND HERE'S WHERE I SUGGEST WE START
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50024 IN A DAY AND AGE WHERE WE HAVE A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THE HUMAN MIND THAN EVER BEFORE THE MOST VALUABLE ASSET THAT WE CAN PASS ON IS
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50025 THERE IS A BRILLIANT AFRICAN PROVERB
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50027 PERSONALLY I DON'T THINK ANYONE CAN SAY THEY MADE IT ALONE
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50028 WE ARE INTERDEPENDENT BEINGS IN AN INTERDEPENDENT SOCIETY AND THAT NEEDS TO BE REFLECTED IN THE VALUES WE ARE IMPARTING TO A
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50029 WE MUST HELP EVERYONE TO NOT FEEL ISOLATED IN A DIGITAL WORLD
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50030 NO MATTER THE REVOLUTION THE MOST VALUABLE RESOURCE HAS BEEN AND ALWAYS WILL BE THAT OF HUMAN POTENTIAL
trainval/aEjUlH7bNDo/50031 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/Aetg4kJie0o/50001 HERE I AM NOW A PROFESSOR OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY AND PHARMACOLOGY
trainval/Aetg4kJie0o/50002 WE CAN'T TELL WHERE PAIN ORIGINATES FROM
trainval/Aetg4kJie0o/50003 OH SURE IF YOU HAVE A BROKEN BONE THAT'S PROBABLY WHERE THE PAIN IS COMING FROM
trainval/Aetg4kJie0o/50005 WE THINK WE'RE WELL ON OUR WAY
trainval/Aetg4kJie0o/50006 WE'RE INCREDIBLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS DISCOVERY
trainval/aeVtSWlH1qY/50001 THEY HAD SEEN PICTURES OF THE PLANES GOING INTO THE TOWERS THE TOWERS COMING DOWN
trainval/aeVtSWlH1qY/50002 BUT THEY HAVE BEEN DISTRACTED RECENTLY
trainval/aeVtSWlH1qY/50003 HE MADE IT OUR PROBLEM
trainval/aeVtSWlH1qY/50004 WHO KILLED BIN LADENISM
trainval/aeVtSWlH1qY/50005 NOW NOT ALL OF THESE THINGS WILL WORK IN LOCAL JIHAD
trainval/aeVtSWlH1qY/50006 MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IT'S A POWER STRUGGLE IN ONE COUNTRY OR EVEN A SMALL REGION WITHIN ONE COUNTRY
trainval/aeVtSWlH1qY/50007 WE DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK TO THAT
trainval/aeVtSWlH1qY/50008 I LIVE IN NEW YORK NOW
trainval/Af5qUxl1ktI/50001 THEY HAVE PERMANENTLY ALTERED THEIR GUT FLORA
trainval/aFBIPOSP7LM/50001 I LOVE THIS IDEA OF ENGAGEMENT
trainval/aFBIPOSP7LM/50002 SO WHEN YOU LEAVE HERE TODAY I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO ENGAGE OR RE ENGAGE
trainval/aFBIPOSP7LM/50003 AND HE WOULD REACT TO BEING DISTURBED ON A SATURDAY MORNING BY STALKING INTO THE PLAYROOM AND
trainval/aFBIPOSP7LM/50004 A PRIMAL APPRECIATION FOR THE BOND WE SHARED
trainval/aFBIPOSP7LM/50005 SCIENTISTS CALL THIS DEIDENTIFICATION
trainval/aFBIPOSP7LM/50006 BUT THERE ARE OTHER FORCES AT WORK TOO
trainval/aFBIPOSP7LM/50007 MOST MIDDLE BORNS DON'T GET QUITE AS SWEET A DEAL
trainval/aFBIPOSP7LM/50008 I THINK OF US AS THE FLYOVER STATES
trainval/aFBIPOSP7LM/50009 AND THERE CAN BE SELF ESTEEM ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT I'VE BEEN ASKED TO DO TED SO I FEEL MUCH
trainval/aFBIPOSP7LM/50010 THAT'S NOT FIGHTING THAT'S PERFORMANCE ART
trainval/aFDKHFsVRnY/50001 AND IS PRESIDENT OF THE MATH CLUB
trainval/afev0ZjAhUA/50001 I KNOW IT HAS FOR ME
trainval/afev0ZjAhUA/50002 THAT THIS PRECIOUS RESOURCE CALLED WATER IS SOMETHING WE ALL HAVE TO SHARE
trainval/AfljJGTVcKE/50001 AND THROUGH THEIR STORY WE'LL SEE THAT PROFOUND CHANGE IS INDEED POSSIBLE
trainval/AfljJGTVcKE/50002 BEING BULLIED BY YOUR SCHOOLMATES IS BIOLOGICALLY AND FUNDAMENTALLY NO DIFFERENT THAN BEING HUMILIATED IN
trainval/AfljJGTVcKE/50003 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/AFRmGkdXkxA/50001 FIFTY PERCENT RISK
trainval/AFRmGkdXkxA/50003 BUT MOST OF THEM DON'T KNOW
trainval/AFRmGkdXkxA/50004 TODAY WE'RE FINALLY DISCUSSING WHAT THIS HOSPITAL DOES THE RIGHT WAY
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50001 SO IF THESE WORDS YOU'VE NEVER HEARD THESE BEFORE I'M NOT SURPRISED
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50002 AND THAT WAS THE HEADLINE ON THE COVER OF THE MAGAZINE THAT MONTH AND THEY PAIRED THAT WITH A PHOTO OF
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50003 LET ME SITUATE MYSELF IN THIS CONVERSATION
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50004 AND THAT WAS OK FOR A WHILE
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50005 I EXISTED IN SORT OF A TOMBOY SPACE FOR MOST OF MY YOUNG ADULTHOOD OR MY YOUNG
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50006 IT DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50007 BUT I HAD NO IDEA HOW TO TALK ABOUT THAT
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50008 UNTIL I WAS ABOUT 23 24 YEARS OLD
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50009 ONE DAY WHILE I WAS JUST ROAMING THROUGH LIVEJOURNAL BORED AFTER CLASS I FOUND A
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50010 I HAD FINALLY FOUND LANGUAGE
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50011 I HAD FINALLY FOUND THE WORDS TO UNDERSTAND MYSELF THROUGH THE WORDS OF SOMEONE ELSE
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50012 SHE IDENTIFIES IN THE SAME WAY AS HER CHARACTER
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50013 SO A SOCIAL TRANSITION INVOLVES ESSENTIALLY THE COMING OUT PROCESS
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50014 HOW DO I THINK ABOUT MY GENDER
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50015 AND THEN COMMUNICATING THAT TO OTHER PEOPLE
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50016 SO THERE ARE SOME FOLKS WHO SAY I DON'T NEED THAT
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50017 NOW LOTS OF PEOPLE KNOW LAVERNE COX WHICH IS WHY I BRING HER UP OFTEN WHEN I DO TRAININGS ABOUT TRANSGENDER
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50018 WE'LL GO BACK TO THE WORD TRANSEXUAL
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50019 SOME FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY SAY THAT'S THE WORD THAT I USE THAT'S HOW I UNDERSTAND MY GENDER
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50020 IT'S NOT COVERED UNDER HEALTH INSURANCE OFTEN SO IT'S OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50021 BUT I WILL CAUTION YOU THAT THE TERM TRANSSEXUAL IS PROBABLY NOT THE BEST WORD THAT YOU SHOULD USE ON A DAY TO DAY
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50022 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OFTEN MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO PAY FOR THEMSELVES
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50023 THERE ARE OTHER FOLKS WHO TRANSITIONED FROM MALE TO FEMALE
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50024 THEY MAKE SENSE WE DON'T HAVE TO CHALLENGE A BUNCH OF STUFF TO TALK ABOUT BINARY IDENTITIES LIKE I
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50025 AND THIS CAN RANGE ANYWHERE FROM 5000 DOLLARS ON THE LOW END OF THE VARIOUS SURGICAL PROCEDURES
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50026 THEY SAY SCREW YOUR IDEAS ABOUT GENDER
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50027 I AM GENDERLESS OR GENDER IS AT LEAST NOT A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF MY LIFE IT'S NOT A WAY THAT I THINK OF MYSELF
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50028 SO WHAT DOES ALL OF THIS MEAN
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50029 SO IT'S NOT FOR EVERYONE NOT EVERY TRANS PERSON GOES THROUGH A TRANSITION IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50030 ALLY IS NO LONGER A NOUN
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50031 SPEAK UP FOR US WHEN WE CAN'T MAYBE DO IT FOR OURSELVES
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50032 BE OK WITH THAT
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50033 IT'S ALL RIGHT WE'LL ALL GET THROUGH IT TOGETHER
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50034 TAKE PEOPLE AT THEIR FACE VALUE
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50035 SOMEONE SAYS THAT THIS IS HOW THEY IDENTIFY BE COOL WITH THAT
trainval/AGivotqSrd0/50036 AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT BINARY IDENTITY IDEAS TRY TO CHALLENGE THOSE
trainval/AgMOJC5R4F8/50001 NORMALLY YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SEE HIM BUT THE AUGMENTED REALITY SYSTEM LETS YOU KNOW
trainval/AgMOJC5R4F8/50002 HE GOES CATCHES THE BALL SPRINTS IN TOUCHDOWN
trainval/AgMOJC5R4F8/50003 FANS WANT TO BE ON THE FIELD
trainval/AgMOJC5R4F8/50004 THEY WANT TO BE THEIR FAVORITE PLAYER
trainval/AgMOJC5R4F8/50005 BUT THE QUESTION I ASK YOU IS IS THAT'S ALL THAT WE'RE CONTENT TO USE AUGMENTED REALITY FOR
trainval/AgMOJC5R4F8/50006 I HAVE TO USE WORDS
trainval/AgMOJC5R4F8/50007 FANS WANT TO BE ON THAT FIELD
trainval/AgMOJC5R4F8/50008 CAN YOU GET THIS ON A RUNNING BACK
trainval/AgMOJC5R4F8/50009 WE WANT THAT EXPERIENCE
trainval/AgMOJC5R4F8/50010 I THINK ADULT DIAPER SALES MAY SURGE
trainval/AgMOJC5R4F8/50011 HOW DO WE USE THIS TO WIN GAMES
trainval/AgMOJC5R4F8/50012 BECAUSE TEAMS ALWAYS USE TECHNOLOGY TO WIN GAMES
trainval/AgMOJC5R4F8/50013 THEY LIKE WINNING
trainval/AgMOJC5R4F8/50015 IT WAS MORE ENTERTAINING
trainval/AgMOJC5R4F8/50016 IT'S ALSO FOR JOCKS
trainval/agNlsB530CI/50002 I COME BACK TO THE PRISON NOT BECAUSE I HAVE ISSUES
trainval/aGSZeDqG8Zk/50001 I DON'T WANT TO ROMANTICIZE POVERTY
trainval/AHcTWlxWzpE/50001 AND SO AS WITH FLIGHT IT'S VERY METABOLICALLY COSTLY
trainval/AHcTWlxWzpE/50002 WE'RE A LITTLE FRIGHTENED BY THINGS THAT CAN PERCEIVE THE WORLD SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN US
trainval/AHcTWlxWzpE/50003 AS I'VE SAID BEFORE BATS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR OUR ECOSYSTEMS TO FUNCTION CORRECTLY
trainval/AHcTWlxWzpE/50004 SO INDEED WE NEED THEM FOR OUR ECOSYSTEMS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY
trainval/AHcTWlxWzpE/50005 WITHOUT THEM IT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM
trainval/AHcTWlxWzpE/50006 IT'S WORKING ITS WAY SLOWLY ACROSS THE US AND WIPING OUT POPULATIONS OF BATS
trainval/AHcTWlxWzpE/50007 AND THE REALITY THAT BATS CAN BRING US SO MUCH BENEFITS IF WE JUST
trainval/AHcTWlxWzpE/50008 IT SIEVES OUT THE BAD VARIATION
trainval/AHcTWlxWzpE/50009 YOU WILL GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE EVOLUTIONARY PRIOR OF THAT SITE IS
trainval/AHcTWlxWzpE/50010 SO SAY FOR EXAMPLE THE REGION OF THE GENOME THAT I WAS LOOKING AT WAS A REGION THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR VISION
trainval/AHcTWlxWzpE/50011 BUT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IT A BIT BETTER
trainval/AHcTWlxWzpE/50012 AND 170 INCREASE OF INDIVIDUALS OVER 80
trainval/AHcTWlxWzpE/50013 WHAT ABOUT HEALTH
trainval/AHcTWlxWzpE/50014 BUT BATS ARE VERY DIFFERENT
trainval/AHcTWlxWzpE/50015 AND HOPEFULLY IN THE NEXT 5 YEARS I'LL BE GIVING YOU A TED TALK ON THAT
trainval/AHfiKav9fcQ/50001 SO YOU KNOW HOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO REACH 10000 STEPS A DAY AS AN IDEAL GOAL FOR LIVING A HEALTHY LIFE AND BEING A HEALTHY
trainval/AHfiKav9fcQ/50002 10000 STEPS IS 5 MILES
trainval/AHfiKav9fcQ/50003 I'LL BE TALKING WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT A FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING THINGS THAT CREATE ADDICTIVE
trainval/AHfiKav9fcQ/50004 YOU DO THE MATH
trainval/AHfiKav9fcQ/50005 AND IT'S NOT MY ACADEMIC CREDENTIALS THAT QUALIFY ME TO SHARE THIS WITH YOU IT'S MY
trainval/AHfiKav9fcQ/50006 SO NO PROBLEM I GO DOWN TO THE BASEMENT CLIMBED TWENTY STAIRS
trainval/AHfiKav9fcQ/50007 AND THIS IS A FRAMEWORK THAT WE SHARED FIRST WITH ME BY TONY ROBBINS WHO'S PULLED THESE NEEDS TOGETHER BUT IT'S BASED ON
trainval/AHfiKav9fcQ/50008 IS GOING TO BECOME AN ADDICTION IF IT MEETS THOSE NEEDS IN A POWERFUL WAY
trainval/AHfiKav9fcQ/50009 YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WAKE UP THAT WHEN YOU CLIMB 374 STAIRS YOU WILL GET AN AWARD CALLED THE STATUE OF LIBERTY
trainval/AHfiKav9fcQ/50010 I AM A SCIENTIST AND THIS IS THE KIND OF CLAIM THAT CAN'T BE EMPIRICALLY VALIDATED SO I CAN'T GO OUT AND TEST IT
trainval/AHfiKav9fcQ/50011 THIS IS ALSO WHY WE BUY LOTTERY TICKETS
trainval/AHfiKav9fcQ/50012 THAT WHATEVER JOB YOU'RE DOING IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE MAKING PROGRESS FROM DAY TO DAY YOU'RE GOING TO BE EXCITED
trainval/AHfiKav9fcQ/50013 THE FIRST OF THE HUMAN NEED
trainval/AHfiKav9fcQ/50014 AND THIS STRIIV ALSO HAS ADAPTIVE BENCHMARKS
trainval/AHfiKav9fcQ/50015 AND I THINK IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT WE COULD PREDICT WHICH BEHAVIORS WOULD SPREAD AND
trainval/AHfiKav9fcQ/50016 I'LL SHARE HOW EACH OF THESE FITS WITH STRIIV AS WE GO THROUGH
trainval/AHfiKav9fcQ/50017 AT THIS POINT THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION WHICH IS NOT THE VANGUARD OF COOL THEY HAVE A WHOLE PAGE ON THEIR WEBSITE
trainval/AHfiKav9fcQ/50018 AND LOOKING AT THE SIX HUMAN NEEDS AGAIN LET'S THINK ABOUT IT
trainval/AHfiKav9fcQ/50019 SO NEED FOR SIGNIFICANCE
trainval/AHfiKav9fcQ/50020 YOU'RE THE CENTER OF ATTENTION
trainval/AHfiKav9fcQ/50021 AND I AM TAKING IN A PERSPECTIVE OF THE FLASH MOBER WHICH IS ANOTHER TERM IN THE DICTIONARY
trainval/AHfiKav9fcQ/50022 EVERYBODY IS LOOKING AT YOU AND YOU'RE CREATING AN EXPERIENCE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO REMEMBER AND MAYBE OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING TO RELIVE
trainval/AHfiKav9fcQ/50023 YOU'RE MEETING YOUR NEED FOR UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE AS WE SAID VARIETY IT'S THE SPICE OF LIFE YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING
trainval/AHfiKav9fcQ/50024 SO WHEN YOU'RE COMING TOGETHER IN A FLASH MOB WITH OTHER PEOPLE IT'S AS IF YOU BECOME THIS GROUP
trainval/AHfiKav9fcQ/50025 YOU'RE CREATING STORIES THAT YOU CAN SHARE POTENTIALLY EVEN WITH YOUR GRAND CHILDREN
trainval/AHfiKav9fcQ/50026 SO NOT A CONTAGIOUS BEHAVIOR AND THIS IS WHY WE HAVE TO REGULATE IT
trainval/AHfiKav9fcQ/50027 I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT IT
trainval/AhKevstJyrc/50001 I STARTED TO RIDE A BICYCLE MORE AND DRIVE THE CAR LESS
trainval/AhKevstJyrc/50002 I CHANGED THE FOOD I WAS PUTTING INTO MY BODY NO MORE OF THAT PACKAGED PROCESSED JUNK INSTEAD WHOLE FOODS
trainval/AhKevstJyrc/50003 BUT WHAT I LEARNED IS THAT SUSTAINABLE LIVING IS A SPECTRUM
trainval/AhKevstJyrc/50004 I COULD CREATE ALL THE ELECTRICITY I NEEDED WITH VERY LITTLE MONEY BECAUSE I NEEDED LESS
trainval/AhSSmLEMgis/50001 REAL TIME DATA
trainval/AhSSmLEMgis/50002 AND HIS PROOF POINT WAS SO POWERFUL THAT AFTER HE DID THAT A GENERATION OF PILOTS AFTER HIM
trainval/AhUhpfKeLus/50001 WE HAVE TO DISRUPT
trainval/aI8KiPiVLyY/50001 HOWEVER AFTER FIVE DECADES OF RESEARCH THERE'S NO STRONG CONSENSUS ON THE
trainval/aI8KiPiVLyY/50002 FOR MANY YEARS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO STANDARDIZATION IN THE DEFINITION OF PMS WHEN
trainval/aI8KiPiVLyY/50003 WE NOW HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF SYMPTOMS AND A HIGH IMPACT ON FUNCTIONING THAT'S REQUIRED
trainval/aI8KiPiVLyY/50004 RESEARCH TELLS US THAT THE MORE A WOMAN BELIEVES THAT EVERYONE GETS PMS THE MORE LIKELY SHE
trainval/aI8KiPiVLyY/50005 LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I MEAN BY ERRONEOUSLY
trainval/aI8KiPiVLyY/50006 WELL I CAN TELL YOU THAT TREATING PMS HAS BECOME A PROFITABLE THRIVING INDUSTRY
trainval/aI8KiPiVLyY/50007 AND THEY ALSO LIST THE MEDICATIONS THAT PHYSICIANS HAVE PRESCRIBED TO TREAT IT LIKE ANTI DEPRESSANTS OR
trainval/aI8KiPiVLyY/50008 SO WE HAVE NOT HAD THAT AT ALL WITH THESE SO CALLED TREATMENTS
trainval/aI8KiPiVLyY/50009 WHEN WOMEN ARE PRESCRIBED DRUGS LIKE ANTI DEPRESSANTS OR HORMONES MEDICAL PROTOCOL REQUIRES THAT
trainval/aI8KiPiVLyY/50010 PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES REAP UNTOLD PROFITS WHEN WOMEN ARE CONVINCED THEY SHOULD TAKE A PRESCRIBED
trainval/aI8KiPiVLyY/50011 NOW FAR BE IT FROM ME TO ARGUE WITH THE MAGICAL POWERS OF CAFFEINE BUT I DON'T THINK REDUCING TENSION
trainval/aI8KiPiVLyY/50012 THE MEDICAL FIELD HAS A LONG HISTORY OF CONCEPTUALIZING WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE PROCESSES AS
trainval/aI8KiPiVLyY/50013 ONE STUDY FOLLOWED MEN AND WOMEN FOR FOUR TO SIX MONTHS AND FOUND THAT THE NUMBER OF MOOD
trainval/aI8KiPiVLyY/50014 IT'S OUT OF HER CONTROL
trainval/aIcwIH1vZ9w/50001 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A PROFESSIONAL TO BE EXCITED ABOUT CULTURE TODAY
trainval/aIcwIH1vZ9w/50002 THEY'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WE PROTECT AND YET WEREN'T STAYING AT ARM'S LENGTH
trainval/aIcwIH1vZ9w/50003 WHAT IS THAT ABOUT
trainval/aIcwIH1vZ9w/50004 WE ARE GOING TO EMBRACE IT
trainval/aIcwIH1vZ9w/50005 THE SAME PEOPLE DID BOTH OF THESE ACTIVITIES
trainval/aIcwIH1vZ9w/50006 AND THE REASON THEY INTERACTED DIFFERENTLY WAS BECAUSE OF THE DESIGN AND THE TOOLS THAT WERE GIVEN TO THEM
trainval/aIcwIH1vZ9w/50007 THIS IS FROM THE L
trainval/aIcwIH1vZ9w/50008 COUNTY MUSEUM OF ART
trainval/aIcwIH1vZ9w/50009 THEY DID THIS PROJECT A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHERE THEY ASKED PEOPLE A QUESTION ABOUT ART
trainval/aIcwIH1vZ9w/50010 THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO IS GOING TO GET MORE INVOLVED
trainval/aIcwIH1vZ9w/50011 SO AGAIN AT OUR MUSEUM WE THINK REALLY CAREFULLY ABOUT HOW TO BRING TO LIFE THE CONVERSATIONS THAT CAN HAPPEN
trainval/aiDSQyFdd68/50001 YOU CAN'T BREATHE AS WELL
trainval/aiDSQyFdd68/50002 AND FOR A WHOLE HOUSE THE NINE HEALTHY LIVING PRACTICES WE TEST CHECK AND FIX 250 ITEMS IN EVERY
trainval/aiDSQyFdd68/50003 WHY DO WE HAVE TO DO THIS WORK
trainval/aiDSQyFdd68/50004 BECAUSE THAT FLUSHES THE BUG OUT
trainval/aiDSQyFdd68/50005 SO WHAT DO WE DO
trainval/aiDSQyFdd68/50006 WE START WORK ON THE FIRST DAY
trainval/aiDSQyFdd68/50007 AND HE CAME OUT AND WITHIN A DAY IT WORKED OUT THAT MOST DUST IN THIS COMMUNITY WAS WITHIN A METER OF THE GROUND THE WIND
trainval/aiDSQyFdd68/50008 BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN NOW THERE WAS A SECOND PROBLEM
trainval/aiDSQyFdd68/50009 THAT'S OUR AVERAGE BUDGET
trainval/aiDSQyFdd68/50010 SO TWO PROBLEMS AND DESIGN SHOULD BE ABOUT MORE THAN ONE THING
trainval/aiDSQyFdd68/50011 I PUT IT TO YOU
trainval/aiDSQyFdd68/50012 IS THIS ELIMINATING POVERTY
trainval/aiDSQyFdd68/50013 AND THAT TO ME IS THE KEY
trainval/aiDSQyFdd68/50014 WELL OVER 1000 PEOPLE USE THOSE TOILETS
trainval/AIfBSkVI6NQ/50001 ESPECIALLY IN TODAY'S ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
trainval/AIfBSkVI6NQ/50002 FOR THE MARKETS TO BOUNCE BACK
trainval/AIfBSkVI6NQ/50003 FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE THE LIFE THEY WANT
trainval/AIfBSkVI6NQ/50004 I AM ONE OF THEM
trainval/AIfBSkVI6NQ/50005 I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO FACE REDUNDANCY
trainval/AIfBSkVI6NQ/50006 AND HOW CAN WE DO THAT TOGETHER
trainval/AIfBSkVI6NQ/50007 OWNING A SPORTS CAR
trainval/AIfBSkVI6NQ/50008 OR RUNNING A MARATHON
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50001 IT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO USE IN THE FUTURE
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50002 NOW THAT INCLUDES THE COST OF MILITARY AND THE COST OF THE FUEL BOTH
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50003 ARE WE SMARTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50004 I'M NOT SURE
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50005 I'M TALKING ABOUT OPEC OIL
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50006 THE OIL IS PRICED OFF THE MARGIN
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50007 YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE ENERGY
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50008 THERE IS NO QUESTION
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50009 SO I THINK I'VE MADE MY POINT THAT WE HAVE TO
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50010 IF WE DID WE COULD SEE THAT OUR OWN RESOURCES ARE EASIER TO USE THAN ANYBODY
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50011 THIS STUFF IS EVERYWHERE
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50012 IT'S MY LIFE
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50013 SOMEBODY THE OTHER DAY SAID I WAS THE SECOND LARGEST NATURAL GAS PRODUCER IN THE UNITED STATES
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50014 DON'T I WISH
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50015 BUT NO I'M NOT
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50016 I OWN STOCKS
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50017 AND I SAID BRIDGE TO WHAT
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50018 WHERE ARE WE HEADED
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50019 SEE BUT AGAIN I TOLD YOU I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY WITH THAT
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50020 YOU'VE MADE THE MONEY YOU NEED
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50021 I THINK IT'S PROBABLY 175 BILLION BARRELS
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50022 I GOT OUT OF SCHOOL IN 51
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50023 I WITNESSED MY FIRST FRACK JOB AT BORDER TEXAS IN 1953
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50024 FRACKING CAME OUT IN 47 AND DON'T BELIEVE FOR A MINUTE WHEN OUR PRESIDENT GETS UP THERE AND SAYS
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50026 I SAW MY FIRST ONE IN 53
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50027 THERE HAD TO HAVE BEEN 800000 WELLS FRACKED IN OKLAHOMA TEXAS KANSAS
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50028 WORTH T HAS BEEN ON IT FOR 25 YEARS
trainval/aIFFFGf1ZRE/50029 WHY ARE ALL THE TRASH TRUCKS TODAY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ON NATURAL GAS
trainval/AIfwFLDXFyQ/50001 THEY ARE MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED IN SENSING THAN ANIMALS
trainval/AIfwFLDXFyQ/50002 AND WHY ARE THEY SO SIMILAR
trainval/aiIxdFBA0Sw/50001 IT'S THE HOLLOWING OUT OF SMALL TOWNS
trainval/aiIxdFBA0Sw/50002 IT'S DOWNTOWNS BECOMING GHOST TOWNS
trainval/aiIxdFBA0Sw/50003 THERE ISN'T A SINGLE LICENSED ARCHITECT IN THE WHOLE COUNTY
trainval/aILSY9g7Tg0/50001 NO ONE'S GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO WITH IT NO ONE'S GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO FOR IT
trainval/aILSY9g7Tg0/50002 WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOOD FOR YOU
trainval/aILSY9g7Tg0/50003 WHAT HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS THAT THE MEN TURNED OUT TO BE EXTREMELY FRUGAL WITH THE MONEY THEY RECEIVED
trainval/aILSY9g7Tg0/50004 AND WHAT DID THEY SPEND IT ON
trainval/aILSY9g7Tg0/50005 IT'S ACTUALLY NOT MY IDEA
trainval/aILSY9g7Tg0/50006 TWO MORE HAD APPLIED FOR HOUSING
trainval/aILSY9g7Tg0/50007 BECAUSE OUR FOREFATHERS WORKED SO HARD TO ACHIEVE OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF PROSPERITY WE CAN NOW AFFORD TO GIVE
trainval/aILSY9g7Tg0/50008 AND AFTER TEN OR MAYBE TWENTY YEARS IT WLL TURN OUT THAT THE INVESTMENT HAS PAID FOR ITSELF
trainval/aILSY9g7Tg0/50009 ABOUT 99 OF YOU WOULD SAY
trainval/aILSY9g7Tg0/50010 OF COURSE NOT
trainval/aILSY9g7Tg0/50011 I THINK ABOUT 99 OF YOU WOULD SAY
trainval/aILSY9g7Tg0/50012 WELL THIS IS A GREAT IDEA
trainval/aILSY9g7Tg0/50013 IT WAS THIS MAN WHO ALMOST IMPLEMENTED A MODEST BASIC INCOME AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 70S IN THE UNITED
trainval/aILSY9g7Tg0/50014 THE BASIC INCOME MAY NOT BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE NEXT 3 OR 4 YEARS BUT IT MAY BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE NEXT
trainval/aILSY9g7Tg0/50015 IDEAS CAN AND DO CHANGE THE WORLD
trainval/aILSY9g7Tg0/50016 IN FACT HISTORY IS RULED BY LITTLE ELSE
trainval/AJg9SXIcPiM/50001 AND DON'T GET ME WRONG MAPPING APPS ARE THE GREATEST GAME CHANGER FOR ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO
trainval/AJg9SXIcPiM/50002 YOU TAKE YOUR PHONE OUT AND YOU KNOW IMMEDIATELY WHERE TO GO
trainval/AJg9SXIcPiM/50003 HOWEVER THE APP ALSO ASSUMES THERE ARE ONLY A HANDFUL OF DIRECTIONS TO THE
trainval/AJYRJ92g4GI/50001 FOOD WATER SEX
trainval/AJYRJ92g4GI/50002 OUR MINDS HAVE EVOLVED IN SUCH A WAY THAT WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THOSE THINGS WE SEEK THEM OUT
trainval/AJYRJ92g4GI/50003 SOUNDS CAN BE NOISE IN ONE CONTEXT AND MUSIC IN ANOTHER
trainval/AJYRJ92g4GI/50004 CLASSICAL MUSICAL TRAINING FOLLOWS THE APPRENTICESHIP MODEL WHERE YOU STUDY WITH ONE OR TWO TEACHERS FOR MANY YEARS
trainval/AJYRJ92g4GI/50005 BUT THE ONE THING THAT KEPT GNAWING AT ME OVER AND OVER AGAIN WAS HOW LITTLE NEUROSCIENCE HAD TRICKLED DOWN INTO THIS MODEL
trainval/AJYRJ92g4GI/50006 THEN IF YOU LISTEN TO THE ENTIRE SENTENCE AGAIN IT WILL SOUND AS IF THE PERSON BURSTS INTO SONG
trainval/AJYRJ92g4GI/50007 SO I DEVELOPED A COURSE CALLED TRAINING THE MUSICAL BRAIN HOW TO USE NEUROSCIENCE TO DEVELOP MORE EFFECTIVE PRACTICE
trainval/AJYRJ92g4GI/50008 THAT I COULDN'T SEE TEN YEARS AGO
trainval/AJYRJ92g4GI/50009 BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN A HUMAN OBSESSION
trainval/AJYRJ92g4GI/50010 IT TURNS OUT THAT WHEN YOUR BRAIN IS ENJOYING A PIECE OF MUSIC THAT MIGHT EVEN GIVE YOU THE
trainval/AJYRJ92g4GI/50011 DOPAMINE DESPITE ITS WIDESPREAD FAME HAS ACTUALLY BEEN UNDERSOLD IN MANY WAYS PEOPLE THINK OF IT AS THE PLEASURE CHEMICAL
trainval/AJYRJ92g4GI/50012 THE WAY THAT DOPAMINE'S AWASH IN THE BRAIN WHILE YOU'RE GETTING THE CHILLS FROM MUSIC IS VERY SPECIFIC TO WHEN AND WHERE IT
trainval/AJYRJ92g4GI/50013 I WAS DEVASTATED
trainval/AJYRJ92g4GI/50014 YOU CAN THINK OF THE CAUDATE AS YOUR PARENT
trainval/AJYRJ92g4GI/50015 HOW COULD THESE JUDGES GAUGE MY MUSICALITY
trainval/AJYRJ92g4GI/50016 THOSE RATS WANTED NOTHING MORE THAN TO PRESS THAT LEVER
trainval/AJYRJ92g4GI/50017 THAT'S WHAT I LEARNED THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS TO BE MUSICAL
trainval/AJYRJ92g4GI/50018 BUT THE MORE DESIRE THERE IS THE BETTER THE PLEASURE
trainval/AJYRJ92g4GI/50019 THAT'S WHAT SHE DOES FOR A LIVING SHE GIVES PLEASURE AND SHE GETS EXHAUSTED BY THE PARTY BUT AT THE PARTY SHE
trainval/AK9OBSx77S8/50001 BUT THEY WERE FORBIDDEN BY AUTHORITIES AT THE TIME TO PROMOTE THE SINGLE WITH A GIG
trainval/AK9OBSx77S8/50002 BUT THE FACT IS THAT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE WAR BANDS STARTED TO
trainval/AK9OBSx77S8/50003 WHEN MUSICIANS WITHOUT BORDERS FIRST ARRIVED IN MITROVICA WE WERE ASKED TO HELP REVIVE THE CITY'S ROCK
trainval/AK9OBSx77S8/50004 I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT THE MITROVICA ROCK SCHOOL IN KOSOVO
trainval/AK9OBSx77S8/50005 AND IT TAKES TIME BUT WE HAVE HAD SOME SMALL SUCCESS STORIES WITH THESE PEOPLE TOO
trainval/AK9OBSx77S8/50006 WE ARE TRYING TO CHANGE WHAT WE CAN WITH GENTLE PUSHING AND PULLING BUT WE'RE NOT WILLING TO PUSH IT TO THE POINT WHERE WE'RE
trainval/akOe5SUsQ2o/50001 I'VE DONE IT EVEN WITH PROGRESSIVE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
trainval/akOe5SUsQ2o/50002 THE LAST PERSON STANDING WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT THEY KNOW
trainval/AkUcaludrcI/50001 THE CEMENT LIKE COMPOSITE CAN BE FORMED INTO SEVERAL DIFFERENT SHAPES WHICH RESULTS IN AN EXTREMELY VERSATILE
trainval/aL00a3sfnYM/50001 WE TALK ABOUT THE BRAIN BUT OF COURSE EVERY BRAIN IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT AND MAYBE THERE ARE SOME INDIVIDUALS OR SOME
trainval/AlCqyZEXM1I/50001 BUT THE POLARIZATION KIND OF WENT BOTH WAYS I'D GO SPEND THE SUMMERS IN MEXICO AND MY COUSINS WOULD CALL
trainval/ALryABSAYiA/50001 IT WAS PRESCRIBED JUST IN CASE
trainval/ALryABSAYiA/50002 SHE DOES FINE POST OP
trainval/ALryABSAYiA/50003 I'M NOT REALLY SURE THIS IMPACTS ME
trainval/ALryABSAYiA/50004 DAY FIVE OF ANTIBIOTICS SHE DEVELOPS DIARRHEA A KNOWN SIDE EFFECT OF ANY ANTIBIOTIC
trainval/ALryABSAYiA/50006 SO I'M GOING TO FINISH WITH A STORY
trainval/ALryABSAYiA/50007 I LOOKED AND SAID COULD WE TRY A DIFFERENT APPROACH
trainval/AlsFSLXjVdw/50001 A YEAR AGO I HAD THE CHANCE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM FOR ENTREPRENEURS AT THE SINGULARITY
trainval/AlsFSLXjVdw/50002 HELP A BILLION PEOPLE
trainval/AlsFSLXjVdw/50003 A FEW WEEKS AGO A GUY FROM A BERLIN BASED COMPANY CALLED ME TRYING TO SELL ME A BUSINESS
trainval/ALTvG9MIR64/50001 LEAD IS A POTENT NEUROTOXIN WHICH CAUSES COGNITIVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND IS
trainval/ALTvG9MIR64/50002 NOW AMIDST THIS INJUSTICE FLINT RESIDENTS WERE RALLYING TOGETHER
trainval/ALTvG9MIR64/50003 AMONGST THEM WERE SOME AMAZING WOMEN OF FLINT MOTHERS CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR KIDS WHO CAME TOGETHER
trainval/ALTvG9MIR64/50004 THIS WAS SCIENCE IN SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC
trainval/ALTvG9MIR64/50005 AND THE STATE OF MICHIGAN WAS FORCED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM AND TAKE STEPS TO CORRECT IT
trainval/ALTvG9MIR64/50006 THESE UNHEALTHY CULTURES THAT ARE FESTERING IN THESE GROUPS WHERE THE FOCUS IS ON MEETING REGULATIONS
trainval/ALTvG9MIR64/50007 IT WASN'T UNTIL I ARRIVED IN GRADUATE SCHOOL AND WITNESSED FIRSTHAND THE CRIMINAL ACTIONS OF
trainval/ALTvG9MIR64/50008 I'M NOT SAYING EVERY SCIENTIST SHOULD BE AN ACTIVIST
trainval/ALTvG9MIR64/50009 THERE ARE REAL AND SOMETIMES VERY PAINFUL CONSEQUENCES OF SPEAKING UP
trainval/ALTvG9MIR64/50010 YOU KNOW WE FELL IN LOVE WITH SCIENCE WHEN WE WERE KIDS AND YET WE SOMEHOW SPEND MOST OF OUR TIME DURING HIGH
trainval/ALTvG9MIR64/50011 THERE IS ALSO A GROWING CULTURE OF DISENGAGEMENT BETWEEN ENGINEERING STUDENTS AND THE PUBLIC
trainval/ALTvG9MIR64/50012 MY UNDERGRADUATE YEARS WERE EXPLICIT JOB PREPARATION AND I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW
trainval/ANFQPEkczYc/50002 I HAD A VARIETY OF ANSWERS THAT I TRIED OUT
trainval/ANFQPEkczYc/50003 SOME OF THEM MADE SENSE
trainval/ANFQPEkczYc/50004 THAT'S ALL IT IS
trainval/ANFQPEkczYc/50005 I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT
trainval/anmktfGYw8k/50002 SO IN THE 1960S I HAD ACCESS TO PRIVILEGE AND RESOURCES IN A WAY THAT MANY SOUTH AFRICANS
trainval/anmktfGYw8k/50003 A FRIEND OF MINE SAID TO ME WHY DON'T YOU TRY THERAPY
trainval/anmktfGYw8k/50004 AND THAT WAS AN AMAZING THING
trainval/anmktfGYw8k/50005 I DISCOVERED ACCESS TO MY UNCONSCIOUS MIND
trainval/anmktfGYw8k/50006 I'M JUST GOING TO SPEED UP A LITTLE BIT
trainval/anmktfGYw8k/50007 AND IF WE IDENTIFY WE DEVELOP EMPATHY
trainval/ao3NtIZ0iBU/50001 COULD WE HAVE IT
trainval/Aoa20kFNYmY/50001 YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50001 IT WAS 90 MINUTES LONG AND THEY TALKED ABOUT SYRIA
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50002 THAT'S WHAT PUTIN WANTED TO TALK ABOUT
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50003 THERE'S NOT A LOT OF MUTUAL LIKE OR TRUST BUT IT'S NOT AS IF THE AMERICANS ARE TELLING HIM WHAT
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50004 WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT ANYMORE
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50005 WE PRODUCE ALL THAT RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50006 BUT IT IS NOW WEAKER THAN IT HAS BEEN AT ANY POINT SINCE WORLD WAR II ALL OF THE CRISES THE
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50007 NUMBER TWO IT WAS EASY TO TAKE A LOT OF CHEAP MONEY OUT OF THE GROUND BECAUSE OIL WAS
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50008 DOES THE ENTIRE MIDDLE EAST FALL APART
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50009 NO THE KURDS WILL DO BETTER AND IRAQ ISRAEL IRAN OVER TIME
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50010 IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50011 THE RUSSIANS ARE PICKING UP THE CRUMBS
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50012 ASIA ACTUALLY LOOKS A LOT BETTER
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50013 THERE ARE REAL LEADERS ACROSS ASIA THEY HAVE A LOT OF POLITICAL STABILITY
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50014 THEY'RE THERE FOR A WHILE
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50015 ABE WHO IS PROBABLY ABOUT TO GET A THIRD TERM WRITTEN IN IN THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN JAPAN OF COURSE XI
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50016 THEY HAD BEEN MORE OPPOSED TO THE UNITED STATES FOR DECADES
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50017 WE SEE IT WITH THE OPENNESS IN CUBA
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50018 WE WILL SEE IT IN VENEZUELA WHEN MADURO FALLS
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50019 NOW LOOK THERE ARE PROBLEMS IN ASIA
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50020 THOSE COUNTRIES CAN FALL OFF THE MAP
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50021 SO YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO SEE AN EXTREME SEGREGATION GOING ON BETWEEN THE WINNERS AND THE LOSERS ACROSS
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50022 LET'S GO NEW YORK REAL ESTATE
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50023 LET'S SEND OUR KIDS TO AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50024 YOU KNOW OUR NEIGHBORS ARE AWESOME CANADA MEXICO AND TWO BIG BODIES OF WATER
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50025 YOU KNOW HOW MUCH TURKEY WOULD LOVE TO HAVE NEIGHBORS LIKE THAT
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50026 WE JUST ACCEPTED 10000 SYRIAN REFUGEES AND WE'RE COMPLAINING BITTERLY ABOUT IT
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50027 I MEAN THE TURKS WOULD LOVE TO HAVE ONLY 10000 SYRIAN REFUGEES
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50028 IF WE KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO BE THE GLOBAL COP ANYMORE IF WE KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE THE ARCHITECT OF GLOBAL TRADE
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50029 WE WANT TO EMULATE THEM
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50030 WE CAN STILL BE THAT CHEERLEADER ON VALUES
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50031 WE CAN STILL BE THE ARCHITECT OF GLOBAL TRADE
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50032 YOU DON'T LIKE IT LUMP IT
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50033 AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING
trainval/AoAbPIbGLUo/50034 THROUGH OUR CELL PHONES INDIVIDUALLY WE HAVE THOSE VOICES TO COMPEL THEM TO CHANGE
trainval/AOEQ9GteWbg/50001 COM AND SYMBOLICS
trainval/AOEQ9GteWbg/50002 SO THE BASIC IDEA OF I
trainval/AOEQ9GteWbg/50003 I KNEW THEM BOTH
trainval/aOW7JZaqKGA/50001 SO WITH THAT DESCRIPTION SURELY ANY ONE OF US COULD BE A HACKER
trainval/aOW7JZaqKGA/50002 IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE SOMETHING THAT WORKED FOR THEM THEY'D JUST MAKE IT THEMSELVES
trainval/aOW7JZaqKGA/50003 AND THEY WERE
trainval/aOW7JZaqKGA/50004 IT WAS SUCH A FREE MEANS OF SELF EXPRESSION
trainval/aOW7JZaqKGA/50005 THERE WASN'T EXACTLY THAT BIG PRIZE MONEY TO BE WON AND THE PARTIES WEREN'T EXACTLY BIG BUDGET
trainval/apbSsILLh28/50001 IT'S A KEY DISTINCTION
trainval/ApGeDdIaxo8/50001 AND I WANTED THAT STORY TO START IN LAKE OKEECHOBEE THE BEATING HEART OF THE EVERGLADE SYSTEM
trainval/ApGeDdIaxo8/50002 IN THE EVERGLADES THEY ARE THE VERY ARCHITECTS OF THE EVERGLADES BECAUSE AS THE WATER DROPS DOWN IN THE
trainval/ApGeDdIaxo8/50003 IT IS RESILIENT
trainval/APgMXDjLcT4/50001 THC IS MORE OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CANNABIS ANXIETY PARANOIA
trainval/APgMXDjLcT4/50002 SO THAT WAS VERY COOL
trainval/APgMXDjLcT4/50003 ACTUALLY WHAT THEY DID NEXT WAS MUCH COOLER
trainval/APgMXDjLcT4/50004 THIS IS VERY EXCITING BECAUSE WHAT YOU ARE DOING HERE IS USING AN EXTERNAL PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY AN MRI SCANNER
trainval/APgMXDjLcT4/50005 PEOPLE HAVE DONE IT WITH PAIN SO WE CAN TELL HOW MUCH PAIN PEOPLE ARE IN AT THE TIME OF THE SCAN
trainval/APgMXDjLcT4/50006 FORTUNATELY WE HAVE MOORE'S LAW ON OUR SIDE SO MOORE'S LAW SAYS THAT COMPUTING POWER DOUBLES ROUGHLY EVERY TWO YEARS
trainval/APgMXDjLcT4/50007 IBM HAVE SIMULATED A 530 BILLION NEURON NETWORK WITH 10 TRILLION SYNAPSES
trainval/apiScBmE6rA/50001 WHAT'S GOING ON
trainval/apiScBmE6rA/50002 THINGS WERE GOING PRETTY WELL
trainval/apiScBmE6rA/50003 I KNEW THERE HAD TO BE ALL SORTS OF SYSTEMS AND TECHNIQUES AND TRAINING TO HAVE TO LIVE A FULL AND
trainval/apiScBmE6rA/50004 AS IT WENT OFF I TOOK OFF AND SAFELY GOT TO THE OTHER SIDE
trainval/aPjvEaE6VXs/50001 IN MY EXPERIENCE LACK OF EDUCATION IS AT THE HEART OF THE MANY PROBLEMS THAT LEAD TO PRISON
trainval/aPjvEaE6VXs/50002 I SAID TURN PRISONS INTO SCHOOLS
trainval/aPjvEaE6VXs/50004 WHY DON'T WE TURN PRISONS INTO SCHOOLS
trainval/APPbSStpGHk/50001 WHAT IF YOU'VE HAD THESE FEELINGS AND EXPERIENCES WITH MORE THAN ONE GENDER
trainval/APPbSStpGHk/50002 I FINALLY GOT THESE CARDS
trainval/APPbSStpGHk/50003 FOR SOME PEOPLE BISEXUALITY MEANS
trainval/APPbSStpGHk/50004 FOR OTHERS IT MEANS
trainval/APPbSStpGHk/50005 WHAT MATTERS TO ME IS THAT THEY ARE BRIGHT AND KIND AND FEMINIST AND LAUGH AT MY JOKES
trainval/APPbSStpGHk/50006 SO WHY IS THAT A PROBLEM
trainval/APPbSStpGHk/50007 THINK OF THE BOX YOU CHECK OFF ON A FORM THAT'S IDENTITY
trainval/APPbSStpGHk/50008 I THINK GENDER IS MULTIDIMENSIONAL AND COMPLEX
trainval/APPbSStpGHk/50009 GUESS WHAT DAY
trainval/APPbSStpGHk/50010 IF YOU'RE A LESBIAN OR A HETEROSEXUAL MAN YOU MIGHT SAY I'M ATTRACTED ONLY TO WOMEN
trainval/APPbSStpGHk/50011 ON A QUIET GENTLE BOY
trainval/apZ2pCGi8RA/50001 MY DAD SAID PUT TOGETHER A PROPOSAL FOR ME
trainval/apZ2pCGi8RA/50002 WHY DO YOU NEED THE MONEY
trainval/apZ2pCGi8RA/50003 WHERE'S IT GOING
trainval/apZ2pCGi8RA/50004 I'LL LOAN YOU THE MONEY IF YOU WANT TO TAKE IT
trainval/apZ2pCGi8RA/50005 BUT IT'S A LOAN SO YOU'LL HAVE TO PAY IT BACK
trainval/apZ2pCGi8RA/50006 AND WHEN I TURNED 21 I DECIDED THAT WANTED TO MOVE BACK TO NY CITY AND I WANTED TO WORK TOWARDS GETTING MY COLLEGE
trainval/AQ8cpjEdpmI/50001 IT'S NO LONGER 2007
trainval/AQ8cpjEdpmI/50002 THIS CATEGORY HAS ONLY BEEN AROUND FOR COUPLE OF YEARS
trainval/AQ8cpjEdpmI/50003 THEY TEND TO CONVERT HIGHER
trainval/AQ8cpjEdpmI/50004 THEY LOVE IT
trainval/AQ8cpjEdpmI/50006 CAN I GET AWAY WITH THAT
trainval/AQ8cpjEdpmI/50007 SO PEOPLE WHO NOW CARRY A 3 INCH DEVICE VS
trainval/AQ8cpjEdpmI/50008 YOU CAN SEE THE POWER OF WHERE THAT'S GOING TO GO FOR US
trainval/AQ8cpjEdpmI/50010 THAT'S THE WORLD THAT WE ARE IN TODAY
trainval/AQ8cpjEdpmI/50011 THAT WAS THE SKIN IN THE GAME
trainval/AQ8cpjEdpmI/50012 SO THEY TREAT THEM LIKE VIPS
trainval/AQ8cpjEdpmI/50013 I MEAN I LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY
trainval/AQ8cpjEdpmI/50014 THAT'S WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT IN THE FUTURE OF ADS
trainval/AQ8cpjEdpmI/50015 SO WE ARE GOING TO SEE MAINSTREAM GO NICHE
trainval/AQ8cpjEdpmI/50016 DON'T THINK ABOUT IT AS DEDICATED TO SCREENS
trainval/AQ8cpjEdpmI/50017 IT'S GOING TO BE OFFSITE DEVICES
trainval/AQ8cpjEdpmI/50018 IT'S GOING TO BE MOBILITY DRIVEN
trainval/AQ8cpjEdpmI/50019 AND DON T THINK ABOUT ONLINE OFFLINE ANYMORE
trainval/AQ8cpjEdpmI/50020 IT'S TECHNOLOGY IT'S CONTENT AND DISTRIBUTION
trainval/AQ8cpjEdpmI/50021 SO THE NEXT GENERATION I THINK WE ARE GOING TO MOVE TO IS THE CONNECTION GENERATION
trainval/aQ8T4sySLxw/50001 THAT HAPPENS RATHER QUICKLY ONCE I GET MY HANDS ON SOME
trainval/aQ8T4sySLxw/50003 YOU ONLY HAVE TO GO OUT YOUR DOOR
trainval/aQ8T4sySLxw/50004 AND ADDED BONUS IT'S CALORIE FREE
trainval/aQ8T4sySLxw/50005 THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE USE PLASTICS IN FOOD PACKAGING
trainval/aQ8T4sySLxw/50006 TO PROTECT FROM THE OXYGEN IN THE AIR
trainval/aQ8T4sySLxw/50007 NANOCELLULOSE IS TYPICALLY AROUND 99 WATER WHEN WE MAKE IT IN THE LAB
trainval/aQ8T4sySLxw/50008 THINNER THAN A HUMAN HAIR EASILY
trainval/aQ8T4sySLxw/50009 THE RESULTING PRODUCT WOULD BE
trainval/aQ8T4sySLxw/50011 DID WE MANAGE
trainval/aQ8T4sySLxw/50012 IN 2015 ALONE WE MADE ABOUT 322 MILLION METRIC
trainval/aQ8T4sySLxw/50013 THAT'S VERY NICE
trainval/AQa3kUJPEko/50001 WHAT I FIND FASCINATING IS THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY WIRED OUR WORLD TO SHARE WHETHER THAT'S OUR
trainval/AQa3kUJPEko/50002 I CALL THIS GROUNDSWELL COLLABORATIVE CONSUMPTION
trainval/AQa3kUJPEko/50003 SMITH A WOULD BE GROWER
trainval/Aqc2SgiOVr8/50001 ARMY MEDICAL SERVICE CORE AND THIS IS WHEN I REALIZED WHAT THE VETERINARY PROFESSION WAS DOING TO MAKE AN
trainval/Aqc2SgiOVr8/50002 5 BILLION ARE INVOLVED WITH LIVE STOCK
trainval/Aqc2SgiOVr8/50003 SO FOR SOME PEOPLE ANIMALS ARE THEIR TRACTORS THEY'RE WHAT'S TEARING THE LAND
trainval/Aqc2SgiOVr8/50004 YOU INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT THAT EACH ANIMAL WILL MAKE SO THE AMOUNT OF
trainval/Aqc2SgiOVr8/50005 I HAVE TWO DOGS
trainval/Aqc2SgiOVr8/50006 AS WELL AS LOOKING AT TRANSMITTABLE DISEASES WHICH A LOT OF TIMES WE THINK OF AS BIG DEALS FOR AVIAN
trainval/Aqc2SgiOVr8/50007 YOU THINK ABOUT IT
trainval/Aqc2SgiOVr8/50008 SO THE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR STOCK LIVESTOCK VETERINARY PROFESSION HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON
trainval/Aqc2SgiOVr8/50009 SO THIS ALLOWS CHILDREN TO GET FOR SOME OF THEM THEIR ONLY MEAL OF THE DAY
trainval/AQcUeQsljSs/50001 OVER THE COURSE OF THE AKRON ART PRIZE I'VE LEARNED TO GET OUTSIDE OF MY OWN HEAD FOR A CHANGE AND THINK ABOUT
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50001 WHEN THINGS GET A LITTLE TOUGH OUT THERE IT'S USUALLY THAT NATIONAL M NAGE TROIS' ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50002 DO YOU KNOW THAT RATS BAGGED THE MORPHINE AND THE COCAINE AND WENT RIGHT FOR THE FILLING
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50003 LATE AT NIGHT
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50005 WHAT ELSE HAMMERS THIS
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50006 AT THE SAME TIME SLEEP DOES
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50007 WHAT ABOUT ZZZ'S
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50008 DO YOU WANT A BELLY THAT EXTENDS FROM HERE TO THE NEXT STATE
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50009 THAT'S A GREAT WAY TO DO IT
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50010 DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SLEEP
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50011 NONE OF GROWTH HORMONE ON BOARD WHEN YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT TIME WHEN YOU'RE IMPAIRED THIS WAY
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50012 ALL OF THE FALSE FIXES WE ARE USED TO IN LIFE
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50013 LOOK AT EVERYTHING ELSE WE DO
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50014 WHAT ABOUT GETTING TO WORK AT FIVE IN THE MORNING AND LEAVING AT MIDNIGHT
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50015 ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50016 AND WHAT DO YOU EAT
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50017 WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO THAT
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50018 THESE ARE WHAT WE CALL FALSE FIXES
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50019 OH SURE THEY FIX SORT OF FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN THEY BOOMERANG RIGHT BACK IN YOUR FACE
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50020 WE'RE GOING TO START WITH THE MIND
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50021 AH THE MIND
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50022 NOW LISTEN UP
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50023 WHAT DO THEY SPEND IT ON
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50024 WE'RE ETERNAL CAREGIVERS TO OUR OWN DETRIMENT
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50025 I TOLD YOU THAT YOU MOST PROBABLY HAVE ADDICTIVE LIKE BEHAVIORS AND YOU DON'T EVEN
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50026 YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU'RE FILLING THAT VOID WITH THIS
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50027 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING YOU'VE PROBABLY NEVER SEEN BEFORE
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50028 THAT'S WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50029 LOOK AT THE OTHER BRAINS
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50030 WE ACTUALLY HAVE ADDICTIVE LIKE HABITS AROUND FOODS
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50031 SURPRISINGLY IT'S NOT KALE
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50032 BUT THEY DO A NUMBER ON YOUR BRAIN
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50033 YOU SEE IT'S NOT A BLACK BOX ANYMORE
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50034 WE CAN PEER IN THERE WITH SCANS
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50035 IS IT REVERSIBLE
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50036 YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50037 I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50038 IT'S A KEEN GRASP OF THE OBVIOUS
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50039 ACTUALLY I DID A NICE LITTLE PIECE ON THIS AND IT WAS FABULOUS
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50040 WHAT IT WAS
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50041 THEY TOOK RATS AND THEY INJECTED THEM WITH MORPHINE AND THEY INJECTED THEM WITH COCAINE AND THEN THEY
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50042 YOU HAVE TOO MUCH STRESS HORMONE BIG BELLY
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50043 YOU CAN'T MOVE YOUR BLOOD SUGAR
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50044 WE FEEL SO GOOD WHEN WE PUT MIND MOUTH AND MUSCLE TOGETHER
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50045 WHEN WE CHANGE GENE EXPRESSION
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50047 BUT THERE'S ONE OTHER PIECE OF THIS TOO
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50048 GOD YOU FEEL REALLY GOOD TOO
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50049 EVERYONE STAND UP
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50050 HERE'S THE SOLUTION
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50051 HOW MANY OF YOU EVER HEARD ABOUT EPIGENETICS
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50052 WHATEVER YOU'RE BORN WITH HONEY THAT WAS YOUR DESTINY
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50053 THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT WORKS ANYMORE
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50055 IT DIED OF EVERY DISEASE VERY EARLY
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50056 WHAT WE DECIDED TO DO WAS JUST SOMETHING FUN
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50057 IT'D PICK THEM UP EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU'D HAVE GREENS AND GOOD WHOLE FOODS
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50058 AT THE SAME TIME WHEN YOU DO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AT THE SAME TIME WHEN YOU MEDITATE THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50059 YOU'RE CHANGING GENE EXPRESSION
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50060 INSTEAD WHAT YOU ACTUALLY SAY
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50061 THIS IS WHAT SHE ENDED UP DOING
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50062 SHE FOUGHT HER FOOD ADDICTION
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50063 SHE FOUGHT HER EVERY SINGLE ADDICTIVE PRACTICE SHE HAD
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50064 GUESS WHAT SHE ENDED UP DOING
trainval/aqhzFd4NUPI/50065 ENDING UP IN THE GUINNESS BOOK OF WORLD RECORDS FOR HOLDING UP THE LONGEST PLANK
trainval/aR6jLD1USW0/50001 BUT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THIS GROUP OF HYPOTHESES NOW FOR ABOUT 10 MONTHS AND WHAT'S REALLY
trainval/aR6jLD1USW0/50002 AND I'M SUGGESTING WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A JUMP OFF OF THEIR REVENUE
trainval/aR6jLD1USW0/50003 AND IN A WORLD WHERE THE U
trainval/aR6jLD1USW0/50004 BUT GUESS WHAT
trainval/aR6jLD1USW0/50005 AND THE SIMPLEST WAY TO LOOK AT IS LOOK AT THE GOOGLE RESULTS PAGE
trainval/aR6jLD1USW0/50006 THEY'LL PROBABLY BE JUST SHORT OF THAT
trainval/aR6jLD1USW0/50007 IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HTML 5 IS LET ME HELP YOU UNDERSTAND
trainval/aR6jLD1USW0/50008 IT IS A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
trainval/aR6jLD1USW0/50009 BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO CONSTRUCT A WEB PAGE WHERE THE ENTIRE
trainval/aR6jLD1USW0/50010 WE HAVE PHOTOGRAPHERS WHO WORK EVERY SHOW WE HAVE PAINTERS AND THE NOTION IS I BELIEVE THAT
trainval/aR6jLD1USW0/50011 BECAUSE IT ESSENTIALLY OPENS UP A NEW CANVAS
trainval/AR6RiSHN7S0/50001 AND I SAY AT LEAST BECAUSE THEY'RE SO SMALL WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO MEASURE THEIR SIZE
trainval/AR6RiSHN7S0/50002 THEY DON'T DIFFER BY VERY MUCH
trainval/AR6RiSHN7S0/50003 SO IF I HAVE A QUARTER OF A GRAM OF NORMAL MATTER MEETING A QUARTER OF A GRAM OF
trainval/AR6RiSHN7S0/50004 WE THINK THAT ANTIMATTER DID PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT PART MUCH EARLIER IN THE
trainval/AR6RiSHN7S0/50005 WE DON'T HAVE A THEORY THAT PREDICTS IT OR THAT DESCRIBES ITS BEHAVIOUR TO US
trainval/AR6RiSHN7S0/50007 IN A SENSE WE ARE THE LEFTOVERS OF THOSE LAST COLLISIONS
trainval/AR6RiSHN7S0/50008 THIS IS WHY IT'S A BIG MYSTERY IN PHYSICS
trainval/AR6RiSHN7S0/50009 UNLESS WE KNOW THIS THERE'S NO WAY OF UNDERSTANDING HOW THE UNIVERSE GOT FROM THE BIG BANG TO NOW
trainval/AR6RiSHN7S0/50010 WE HAVEN'T BY ANY MEANS LOOKED AT THE FULL DATA SET YET
trainval/AR6RiSHN7S0/50011 AND SO FAR WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING UNTOWARD
trainval/AR6RiSHN7S0/50012 IT'S A REALLY BIG PROBLEM
trainval/AR6RiSHN7S0/50013 IT DISCOVERED THE HIGGS BOSON A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
trainval/AR6RiSHN7S0/50014 IT'S AN EXPERIMENT CALLED LHCB AND WE WORK ON THIS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL
trainval/AR6RiSHN7S0/50015 THIS DETECTOR MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO ISOLATE THE SAMPLES OF MATTER AND ANTIMATTER THAT WE NEED TO
trainval/AR6RiSHN7S0/50016 WELL WE'VE MADE MEASUREMENTS OF MATTER WE'VE MADE MEASUREMENTS OF ANTIMATTER AND AS I'VE SAID WE DON'T HAVE A THEORY THAT
trainval/AR6RiSHN7S0/50017 WHAT IS DARK MATTER FOR INSTANCE
trainval/AR6RiSHN7S0/50018 HOW DOES GRAVITY BEHAVE AT VERY SMALL SCALES
trainval/AR6RiSHN7S0/50019 AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS ENABLES US TO LOOK AT THE UNIVERSE IN A REGIME WHERE WE HAVE NEVER
trainval/ARGkp6am3S8/50001 WE NATURALLY HAVE THAT
trainval/ARGkp6am3S8/50002 WALT DISNEY WAS FIRED FROM HIS FIRST JOB AT A NEWSPAPER BECAUSE HE LACKED IMAGINATION
trainval/ARGkp6am3S8/50003 TURN OFF THE INTERNET
trainval/arj7oStGLkU/50001 THEY CAME AND WENT AND I COULDN'T QUITE DO STUFF
trainval/arj7oStGLkU/50002 AND THEY SAY IS THIS TIM URBAN
trainval/arj7oStGLkU/50003 AND I SAY YEAH
trainval/arj7oStGLkU/50004 I WANT YOU TO TAKE A LOOK CAREFULLY TO SEE IF YOU CAN NOTICE A DIFFERENCE
trainval/arj7oStGLkU/50005 BUT THERE'S A SECOND KIND OF PROCRASTINATION THAT HAPPENS IN SITUATIONS WHEN THERE IS NO DEADLINE
trainval/ARWBdfWpDyc/50001 BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THIS IS COMPLETELY WRONG IT'S THE WRONG WAY AROUND BECAUSE AT THAT POINT IN TIME THERE'S
trainval/ARWBdfWpDyc/50002 BUT I THINK THAT'S OK AND IN FACT MY FEARS WERE COMPLETELY UNWARRANTED
trainval/ARWBdfWpDyc/50003 SO I THINK WE SHOULD NEVER EVER FEEL BAD ABOUT NOT KNOWING SOMETHING AND WE SHOULD NEVER FEEL BAD ABOUT ASKING
trainval/ARWBdfWpDyc/50004 IT TOTALLY DOESN'T BY THE WAY
trainval/ARWBdfWpDyc/50005 SO LET ME GET A SHOW OF HANDS
trainval/ARWBdfWpDyc/50006 SO I'LL PAINT A PICTURE
trainval/ARWBdfWpDyc/50007 IT'S NOT SMASHED IT
trainval/ARWBdfWpDyc/50008 IT'S NOT INTERACTED WITH IT AT ALL
trainval/ARWBdfWpDyc/50009 THERE'S BEEN A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT COME ABOUT BECAUSE OF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF QUANTUM PHYSICS
trainval/ARWBdfWpDyc/50010 AND THERE'S THIS OTHER SOUND BITE YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD ABOUT QUANTUM PHYSICS
trainval/ARWBdfWpDyc/50011 WELL THAT'S ACTUALLY WRONG
trainval/ARWBdfWpDyc/50012 WE DO UNDERSTAND QUANTUM PHYSICS VERY WELL AND YOU'D KIND OF HOPE THAT WE DID IF IT FORMS THE
trainval/ARWBdfWpDyc/50013 BUT WE CAN DESCRIBE IT ALL VERY WELL USING MATHEMATICS
trainval/ARWBdfWpDyc/50014 SO IT'S FASCINATING THAT SOMETHING CAN BE SO COUNTERINTUITIVE ON ONE HAND BUT YET CAN BE SO
trainval/ARWBdfWpDyc/50015 SO NUMBER ONE
trainval/ARWBdfWpDyc/50016 AND IT'S OUR JOB TO EXPLAIN THE INFORMATION IN TERMS THAT THEY ALREADY UNDERSTAND
trainval/ARWBdfWpDyc/50017 AND HOW DO YOU DO THIS
trainval/ARWBdfWpDyc/50018 DON'T GO TOO FAR DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE
trainval/ARWBdfWpDyc/50019 THERE'S SO MUCH GOOD INFORMATION OUT THERE THESE DAYS
trainval/aS1UEAGCo30/50001 THERE ARE PLENTY OF DOWNSIDES
trainval/aS1UEAGCo30/50002 YOU'VE HAD TO WRESTLE WITH ISSUES LIKE CHILD PORNOGRAPHY
trainval/aS1UEAGCo30/50003 CA AND THAT CONTENT IS ALL OFF THE BOARD NOW
trainval/aS1UEAGCo30/50004 RIGHT IT'S GONE
trainval/aS1UEAGCo30/50005 OR IS IT STILL UP THERE
trainval/AS3Pyc4Qr2Q/50001 WE WEREN'T RICH WE WEREN'T POOR
trainval/AS3Pyc4Qr2Q/50002 IT'S JUST NOT FAIR
trainval/AS3Pyc4Qr2Q/50003 ARE SOLD AGAIN
trainval/AS3Pyc4Qr2Q/50004 SHE WAS RESCUED OUT OF THIS SITUATION
trainval/AS3Pyc4Qr2Q/50005 THAT'S THE FIRST STEP
trainval/AS3Pyc4Qr2Q/50006 IT WAS CRAZY
trainval/asgdGSGQBgY/50001 SO THE SENTENCE GOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS
trainval/asgdGSGQBgY/50002 BASICALLY IN MY HEART I'M THINKING OF A PERSON I'VE MISSED THIS PERSON
trainval/asgdGSGQBgY/50003 I STARTED TO GET A PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORY
trainval/asgdGSGQBgY/50004 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN I REMEMBERED WORDS I STARTED TO REMEMBER HOW THEY LOOKED ON THE PAGE
trainval/asgdGSGQBgY/50005 THIS IS SOMETHING I COULDN'T DO BEFORE
trainval/asgdGSGQBgY/50006 YOU CAN COUNT THEM ON YOUR HANDS
trainval/asgdGSGQBgY/50007 LET'S TAKE AN EXAMPLE IN THE 60'S A CHINESE RESEARCH TEAM DEVELOPED A
trainval/asgdGSGQBgY/50008 BUT IN CHINA THERE'S A SENTENCE THERE'S A PHRASE IT'S PINYIN
trainval/asgdGSGQBgY/50009 I WILL PAY I WILL PAY BECAUSE FOR EVERYONE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT NEXT TIME SOMEONE ELSE WILL
trainval/asgdGSGQBgY/50010 NOW YOU MAY THINK THIS IS OF NO INTEREST AND IT'S LIKE BANAL BUT ACTUALLY IT INSCRIBES THE
trainval/asgdGSGQBgY/50011 THIS IS RELEVANT BECAUSE OUR IDEA OF ROMANTIC LOVE IS ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE IT'S SOMETHING WHICH IS SPECIAL IN THE
trainval/asgdGSGQBgY/50012 I'VE ACTUALLY WITNESSED THIS WITH A MIDDLE AGED COUPLE AND THEY DIDN'T SPEAK TO EACH OTHER AFTER THEY GOT ANGRY WITH EACH
trainval/asgdGSGQBgY/50013 BUT ACTUALLY IF WE START THINKING ABOUT THE WAY LOVE IS LIVED AND PERCEIVED BY INDIVIDUALS
trainval/aSGIZBmGOsU/50001 SO WE BROUGHT STUDENTS INTO THE LAB WE HAD THEM FILL OUT A NUMBER OF SCALES AND THEN THEY CAME IN A WEEK LATER AND PLAYED THE GAME FOR AN
trainval/aSGIZBmGOsU/50002 AND SO WE STARTED LOOKING AT WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF COOPERATIVE GAME PLAY
trainval/aSJn0xD0TXs/50001 SO WE THINK WE CAN ONLY GO ABOUT A FACTOR OF SIXTEEN DENSER IN TRANSISTORS ON A CHIP
trainval/aSJn0xD0TXs/50002 BECAUSE OUR CLASSICAL COMPUTERS HAVE TO GROW EXPONENTIALLY IN SIZE IN ORDER TO
trainval/aSJn0xD0TXs/50003 AND THE OTHER ASPECT IS NEUROMORPHIC OR COGNITIVE COMPUTING
trainval/aSJn0xD0TXs/50004 THAT MAKES THE BRAIN VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND
trainval/askcLEVCTko/50001 I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT AFTER SEEING SOME NUMBERS IN BRAZIL SAYING THAT 65 PERCENT OF WOMEN DON'T FEEL
trainval/askcLEVCTko/50003 SO IT ALL STARTS WITH
trainval/askcLEVCTko/50004 WOMEN THAT WE SEE IN ADS ARE OFTEN NOT REAL
trainval/askcLEVCTko/50005 AND I'M NOT ONLY SAYING ABOUT PHOTOSHOP
trainval/askcLEVCTko/50006 WHICH LEADS ME TO THE SECOND COMPONENT
trainval/askcLEVCTko/50007 BRANDS ARE NOT SAYING HEY YOU WOMAN I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
trainval/askcLEVCTko/50008 WHAT DO YOU WANT
trainval/askcLEVCTko/50009 THEY ALSO WANT TO BE THE PROTAGONISTS OF THEIR OWN STORIES
trainval/askcLEVCTko/50010 THEY WANT BRANDS THAT COMMUNICATE STRAIGHT TO THEM HEY WHAT DO YOU WANT
trainval/askcLEVCTko/50011 I WANT TO PLEASE YOU
trainval/askcLEVCTko/50012 THEY DON'T WANT TO BE OBJECTIFIED ANYMORE THEY WANT RESPECT FOR THEIR BODIES AND IDENTITIES
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50001 BILL HAD NEVER TAKEN THAT MUCH TIME OFF FROM WORK
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50002 WE STARTED ASKING OURSELVES QUESTIONS
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50003 WERE THERE THINGS THAT WEREN'T BEING DONE
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50004 THERE WAS A LOT WE DIDN'T KNOW
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50005 YOU JUST GO DOWN TO THE DRUG STORE
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50006 I DON'T TELL THEM WHO I AM
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50007 PAIR OF KHAKIS
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50008 THAT WAS ERADICATED SO THAT GOT DOWN TO ZERO
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50010 IT WAS INCREDIBLE
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50011 WE CAN SPEND AID SMARTER
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50012 I WAS ACTUALLY REALLY EXCITED
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50013 FOR ME I COME AT IT FROM INTUITION
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50014 CAN YOU GET A WOMAN TO ACCEPT THOSE POLIO DROPS IN HER CHILD'S MOUTH
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50015 WELL WE GOT HUNDREDS OF IDEAS
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50016 MAYBE A FEW OF THOSE WILL WORK OUT
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50017 THEY BRING DOWN THE DROPOUT RATE
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50018 IT'S INCREDIBLE HOW PEOPLE THINK OKAY THAT COULD BE ME AND THE MONEY FLOWS
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50019 THEY HAVE LESS VIOLENCE AND CRIME IN THOSE SCHOOLS
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50020 BUT THE THING THAT WE LEARNED FROM THAT WORK AND WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE THE FUNDAMENTAL KEY IS A GREAT TEACHER IN FRONT
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50021 SO SHE KEPT WANTING TO TALK TO ME AND JENN
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50022 WE KEPT TRYING TO ENGAGE HER BUT SHE WAS SHY
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50023 HE SAID I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING TO PAY FOR HER EDUCATION
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50024 I CAN'T PAY FOR PRIVATE SCHOOL AND SHE MAY END UP ON THIS FARM LIKE MY WIFE
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50025 THEY WON'T HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50026 HOW ON EARTH DID THAT HAPPEN
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50027 I GUESS THERE'S A LONG VERSION AND A SHORT VERSION OF THAT
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50028 BUT WE WERE STUNNED
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50029 BG WE HAD NEVER EXPECTED IT AND IT HAS BEEN UNBELIEVABLE
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50030 WE'RE NOT TRYING TO HOMOGENIZE IT
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50031 PEOPLE GIVE TO SOME THINGS
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50032 WE LOOK AND GO WOW
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50033 AND THEY START TO SEE OTHERS DOING IT AND SAYING WOW I WANT TO DO THAT WITH MY OWN MONEY
trainval/aSLSiIskEFU/50034 TRADITION HERE WHICH IS THE STRONGEST IS THE ENVY OF THE WORLD
trainval/ASOvJjAw2Jo/50001 AND ALONG THE WAY HE BECAME THE FACE FOR THE US GOVERNMENT'S RECENT PATTERN OF PROSECUTING WHISTLEBLOWERS AND
trainval/ASOvJjAw2Jo/50002 SUDDENLY AFTER YEARS OF CLAIMING IT WAS VITAL TO THEIR CASE THE GOVERNMENT DROPPED THEIR DEMANDS TO RISEN
trainval/ASOvJjAw2Jo/50003 SO WE RISK SEEING THE PRESS UNABLE TO DO THEIR JOB THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS SUPPOSED TO PROTECT BECAUSE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S
trainval/ASQpKiUSNHo/50001 AND ACTUALLY WE'VE DONE THIS WITH THE TEEB PROJECT
trainval/ASQpKiUSNHo/50002 SO CLEARLY THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH DEFORESTATION
trainval/ASQpKiUSNHo/50003 SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE SOME MOVEMENT FORWARD
trainval/ASQpKiUSNHo/50004 BUT THE THING IS TO DO A LOT MORE OF THAT
trainval/ASQpKiUSNHo/50005 LET'S THINK ABOUT IT AND WHAT IT MEANS BUT PLEASE LET'S NOT DO MORE OF THAT
trainval/ASY5DjSZUDE/50001 AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE MESSAGE WE SEND IS WHEN WE DO THAT
trainval/ASY5DjSZUDE/50002 WE ARE SENDING THE MESSAGE HEY KID
trainval/ASY5DjSZUDE/50003 ONCE UPON A TIME A CHILD CAME UPON A BUTTERFLY STRUGGLING TO EMERGE FROM ITS CHRYSALIS
trainval/aT6vIq6S1OE/50001 IN 1963 A STORM RIPPED UP THE HARBOR IN A SMALL SOUTH AFRICAN TOWN CALLED
trainval/aT6vIq6S1OE/50002 NOW THIS IS REAL INNOVATION NOT THE WAY PEOPLE HAVE EXPROPRIATED THE WORD TO TALK ABOUT LAUNCHING
trainval/aT6vIq6S1OE/50003 BECAUSE WE HAVE TO
trainval/aT6vIq6S1OE/50004 BECAUSE WE HAVE REAL PROBLEMS
trainval/aT6vIq6S1OE/50005 WE HAVE REALLY SEVERE ENERGY PROBLEMS IN AFRICA
trainval/aT6vIq6S1OE/50006 THE GOLD OF TODAY IS MOBILE AND MOBILE IS THE ENABLER THAT MAKES ALL OF THIS POSSIBLE
trainval/aT6vIq6S1OE/50007 SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO WITH IT
trainval/aT6vIq6S1OE/50008 AND IF YOU CAN DO THAT YOU CAN RISE OUT OF POVERTY
trainval/aT6vIq6S1OE/50009 THIS IS INNOVATION OVER THE EDGE
trainval/aTgPJQ9Dy7Q/50001 AFTER THAT YEAR WAS OVER I WENT BACK TO LONDON TO WRITE UP THE RESULTS OF MY RESEARCH
trainval/aTgPJQ9Dy7Q/50002 THAT'S WHEN I FIRST CAME ACROSS THE IDEA THAT I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY
trainval/aTgPJQ9Dy7Q/50003 ON THE FACE OF IT WRITING IS JUST A SIMPLE ACT
trainval/aTgPJQ9Dy7Q/50004 BUT IT'S ALSO ALL ABOUT PRACTICE
trainval/aTgPJQ9Dy7Q/50005 THIS IS NOT OF CONCERN TO US HERE TODAY BUT IT GOES TO SHOW THAT WRITING DOES SOMETHING TO OUR
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50001 IN REGARDS TO THE SEGMENT ON KERRIE ANNE'S SHOW THIS MORNING WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT WHEN SHE TALKED ABOUT
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50002 AND THAT IS HOW THINGS LIKE STEUBENVILLE OHIO HAPPENS
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50003 THAT IS HOW THINGS LIKE THE ROAST BUSTERS IN AUCKLAND HAPPENS
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50004 BOYS THINK THAT IT'S SO MUCH THEIR RIGHT TO TREAT A WOMAN'S BODY AS THEY PLEASE THAT NOT ONLY WOULD THEY
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50005 THEY'LL ACTUALLY DOCUMENT THE EVIDENCE AND PUT IT ON THE INTERNET FOR EVERYONE TO SEE WHAT A BIG MAN THEY ARE
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50006 OUR VAGINAS AREN'T CARS THAT WE CAN WALK AWAY FROM AND LEAVE
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50007 IT'S PEOPLE PREFERRING TO BELIEVE THAT THE WOMEN IN THEIR LIVES ARE POTENTIAL VICTIMS RATHER THAN ACCEPTING THAT THE
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50008 WE THE WOMEN HAVE TO PROTECT OURSELVES AGAINST THEM
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50009 I AM NOT SAYING THAT RAPE IS GOOD GIRLS I'M JUST SAYING CAN'T YOU JUST LEARN TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELVES
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50010 GIRLS WHEN WILL YOU LEARN THAT THE WORLD IS FULL OF EVIL MONSTERS AND YOU HAVE TO PROTECT YOURSELVES
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50011 THAT'S WHAT RAPE CULTURE LOOKS LIKE
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50012 BUT THE WORLD THAT PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE RAPE IS NOT NICE
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50013 I DON'T WANT TO BE IMPRISONED BY IT AND THIS IS WHAT I THINK
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50014 BECAUSE WHAT IT DOES IS THAT IT FORCES US TO DIMINISH OURSELVES
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50015 IT MEANS THAT WE TAKE UP LESS SPACE THAN WE'RE ENTITLED TO
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50016 WE LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE WOMEN ARE TAUGHT THEY DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO WALK DOWN THE STREET AT NIGHT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE ACCESS
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50017 AND I THINK THAT'S AN ACT OF TERRORISM AND I WILL NOT NEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS ON THOSE TERMS
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50018 SO I DO NOT ENGAGE PEOPLE IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHY WOMEN NEED TO PROTECT THEMSELVES OR
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50019 AND ONLY A HANDFUL OF THEM WILL EVER SEE JUSTICE PREVAIL
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50020 I AM UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE FACT THAT BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT I DO I STAND IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE LIKE THIS AND I AUTOMATICALLY THINK
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50021 BECAUSE THE RESULT OF THAT IS THAT THEY ACTUALLY DO START TO CHANGE
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50022 IN ALL OF THE TIME THAT I'VE BEEN WRITING AND WRITING ABOUT RAPE IN ALL THE EMAILS THAT I'VE GOTTEN
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50023 IT'S MADE THEM REALIZE IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50024 AND THE RAPISTS WAS IN RED AND THE WHOLE VENN DIAGRAM WAS IN RED BECAUSE THE ONLY THING COMMON TO ALL EXPERIENCES OF RAPE
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50025 THAT'S THE ONLY THING WE CAN SAY CAUSES RAPE
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50027 AND THE WAY WE TALK ABOUT RAPE AS IF IT'S SOME KIND OF ARBITRARY THING THAT JUST HAPPENS TO WOMEN
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50028 AND I BELIEVE THAT TO FIX THE PROBLEM YOU HAVE TO NAME THE PROBLEM
trainval/ATISgVUKetI/50029 HE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ENGAGED IN THESE TOPICS BECAUSE SOCIETY ENABLES HIM TO NOT BE ENGAGED IN THEM
trainval/atKSMfx4E3I/50001 PROTEST PROVIDES US ONE WAY TO DO THAT
trainval/AU66C6HePfg/50001 LAST WEEK I PASSED THROUGH UPPER STREET IN NORTH LONDON ON MONDAY AND WEDNESDAY EVENINGS AT 7 P
trainval/AU66C6HePfg/50002 I DON'T OWN ANY FURNITURE AND I DON'T HAVE ANY CHILDREN
trainval/AU66C6HePfg/50003 I LIKE THE IDEA OF LIVING ABROAD SOMEDAY
trainval/AU66C6HePfg/50004 PERSONAL DATA IS CONSIDERED ANYTHING THAT CAN BE TRACED DIRECTLY BACK TO YOU
trainval/AU66C6HePfg/50005 IT ONLY MEANS THAT THEY NEED YOUR PERMISSION
trainval/AU66C6HePfg/50006 NOW I LIVE IN A RECENTLY CONVERTED FLAT WITH A PRIVATE LANDLORD AND I HAVE A HOUSEMATE
trainval/AU66C6HePfg/50007 IN 2015 SAMSUNG WAS FOUND TO BE RECORDING PEOPLE IN THE HOMES IN WHICH THEIR TVS HAD BEEN
trainval/AU66C6HePfg/50008 PERSONALISED BROWSER ADS MAY BE HARMLESS BUT CONNECTING DISPARATE ASPECTS OF YOUR LIFE TO
trainval/AU66C6HePfg/50009 IT'S NOT JUST LARGE COMPANIES DIGGING INTO YOUR LIFE IT'S FREE APPS AND SMALL STARTUPS AS WELL
trainval/AU66C6HePfg/50010 COMPANIES ARE ALSO STARTING TO PREDICT FUTURE BEHAVIOURS FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER YOU'RE A TRUSTWORTHY DRIVER A GOOD
trainval/AU66C6HePfg/50011 I IMMEDIATELY WROTE TO MY LOCAL COUNCIL AND ASKED THEM TO MAKE MY VOTER RECORDS PRIVATE
trainval/AU66C6HePfg/50012 I MADE UP A FAKE EMAIL ADDRESS AND I STARTED REGISTERING WITH A FAKE AGE AND GENDER
trainval/AU66C6HePfg/50013 I TURNED OFF TARGETED ADVERTISING AND I ASKED FACEBOOK TO SEND ME ALL THE INFORMATION THAT THEY HELD ON ME
trainval/AU66C6HePfg/50014 I REALISED ON MY PHONE THAT EVERY TIME I LOGGED FITNESS DATA INTO THE APP ENDOMONDO IT WAS SHARING MY
trainval/AU66C6HePfg/50015 FOR EXAMPLE I STOPPED SIGNING UP TO SUPPOSEDLY FREE SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE A VIP CARD AT MY
trainval/AU66C6HePfg/50016 THIS MEANS IT WILL BECOME TOO EXPENSIVE FOR COMPANIES GOVERNMENTS AND NON PROFITS TO RECKLESSLY
trainval/AU66C6HePfg/50017 I HAVE GIVEN UP MY RIGHT TO SELF DETERMINATION AND FREE CHOICE
trainval/aUBawr1hUwo/50001 IT'S AN OLD IDEA
trainval/aUBawr1hUwo/50002 WHEREVER WE ARE ANY TIME OF NIGHT OR DAY OUR BOSSES JUNK MAILERS OUR PARENTS CAN GET TO
trainval/aUBawr1hUwo/50003 AND KEVIN WROTE HIS LAST BOOK ON FRESH TECHNOLOGIES WITHOUT A SMARTPHONE OR A LAPTOP OR A TV
trainval/aUBawr1hUwo/50004 OTHERWISE REALLY I'M JUST FOISTING ON THEM MY EXHAUSTION OR MY DISTRACTEDNESS WHICH IS NO
trainval/aUBawr1hUwo/50005 I HAD REALLY INTERESTING FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES I HAD A NICE APARTMENT ON PARK AVENUE AND 20TH
trainval/aUBawr1hUwo/50006 IN MANY A PIECE OF MUSIC IT'S THE PAUSE OR THE REST THAT GIVES THE PIECE ITS BEAUTY AND ITS
trainval/aUBawr1hUwo/50007 I HAVE NEVER ONCE HAD TO USE A CELL PHONE THERE
trainval/aUBawr1hUwo/50008 SOME PEOPLE GO TO BLACK HOLE RESORTS WHERE THEY'LL SPEND HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS A NIGHT IN ORDER TO HAND OVER THEIR
trainval/audakxABYUc/50001 THIS ACTUALLY HAD SYMBOLIC VALUE BADGE VALUE
trainval/audakxABYUc/50002 IT SAID THAT YOUR FAMILY HAD MADE A GREAT SACRIFICE IN THE PAST
trainval/audakxABYUc/50003 I'M JUST AN AD MAN
trainval/audakxABYUc/50004 HERE IS MY NAIVE ADVERTISING MAN'S SUGGESTION
trainval/audakxABYUc/50005 IT'S HELD EVERY TWO YEARS IN BURMA
trainval/audakxABYUc/50006 I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY KNOWS IT
trainval/audakxABYUc/50008 SO HE TRIED PLAN B
trainval/audakxABYUc/50009 HE TRIED THE MARKETING SOLUTION WHICH IS HE DECLARED THE POTATO AS A ROYAL VEGETABLE AND NONE BUT THE ROYAL FAMILY COULD CONSUME IT
trainval/audakxABYUc/50010 IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IF YOU WANT TO LIVE IN A WORLD IN THE FUTURE WHERE THERE ARE FEWER MATERIAL GOODS YOU BASICALLY HAVE TWO
trainval/audakxABYUc/50011 YOU START WITH 12 AND THEY TAKE THEM AWAY
trainval/audakxABYUc/50012 THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE BY THE WAY THAT THINGS LIKE SOCIAL NETWORKING HELP DO THAT
trainval/audakxABYUc/50014 SO THEY ACTUALLY REDUCE THE NEED FOR ACTUALLY SPENDING GREAT MONEY ON DISPLAY AND INCREASE THE KIND OF THIRD PARTY ENJOYMENT
trainval/aUYSDEYdmzw/50001 AND SO I DID THINGS LIKE TRAVEL TO SOUTH AFRICA WHERE I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO
trainval/aUYSDEYdmzw/50002 I WANT TO SHARE SOME OF THOSE WITH YOU NOW
trainval/AvtStbwMQqs/50001 400 PEOPLE WITH MORE MONEY THAN 150 MILLION PEOPLE
trainval/AvtStbwMQqs/50002 AND IN FACT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY JUST A WEEK AGO PUBLISHED A STUDY SAYING THAT THE UNITED STATES IS IN FACT
trainval/AvtStbwMQqs/50003 AND AS YOU SEE ACROSS AMERICAN LIFE THIS KIND OF PAIN OF THAT SORT OF WEALTH DISTRIBUTION AND
trainval/AvtStbwMQqs/50004 THIS IS OF COURSE A HUMAN RIGHTS CONCERN FOR ANYONE LIKE MYSELF WHO MAKES IT THEIR LIFE'S FOCUS
trainval/AvtStbwMQqs/50005 BUT AT THE SAME TIME THAT ISN'T THE STORY THAT THE CUBAN PEOPLE I MET ALONG THE ROADS AND IN TOWNS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY
trainval/AvtStbwMQqs/50006 THEY WISHED THEY HAD GREATER ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY OF THE WORLD AND THEY WISHED IT WERE MORE EASY FOR THEM TO
trainval/AvtStbwMQqs/50007 I MYSELF HAD AN EMERGENCY IN THE PAST WEEK WHILE I WAS HERE IN CUBA
trainval/AvtStbwMQqs/50008 CUBA LITERALLY HAS A PROGRAM OF TEACHING YOUNG PEOPLE ENVIRONMENTALISM IN THE SCHOOLS
trainval/AvtStbwMQqs/50009 BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO JUST SAY HOW EXCITING IT IS YOU HAVE TO DETERMINE WHICH DIRECTION YOU ARE GOING TO GO IN
trainval/AvtStbwMQqs/50010 HERE I THINK WE HAVE TWO PATHS THAT DIVERGE
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50001 WE SUBMITTED THE PAPER
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50002 I DON'T DO THAT
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50003 THEY TAUGHT US HOW TO FEED MICE DRUGS
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50004 WE TOOK MICE AND WE GAVE THEM ONE P PAROXETINE
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50005 WELL IT'S VERY HARD TO DO THAT
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50006 IN FACT IT'S NOT TRADITIONALLY DONE
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50007 I SAID YOU KNOW NICK WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW DRUGS WORK AND HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER AND HOW THEY WORK SEPARATELY AND WE DON'T HAVE A
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50008 BUT THE FDA HAS MADE AVAILABLE AN AMAZING DATABASE
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50009 IT'S A DATABASE OF ADVERSE EVENTS
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50010 NICK CAME BACK
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50011 HE TOOK ALL THE DRUGS THAT WERE KNOWN TO CHANGE GLUCOSE AND A BUNCH OF DRUGS THAT DON'T CHANGE GLUCOSE AND SAID WHAT'S THE
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50012 DIFFERENCES IN FATIGUE
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50013 IN URINATION HABITS
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50014 ALL THOSE THINGS CONSPIRED TO GIVE HIM A REALLY GOOD PREDICTOR
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50015 HE SAID RUSS I CAN PREDICT WITH 93 PERCENT ACCURACY WHEN A DRUG WILL CHANGE GLUCOSE
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50016 THEY STUDIED IT VERY CAREFULLY SKEPTICALLY THEY APPROVED IT
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50017 I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT SAY THAT
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50019 I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT SAY THAT SO I DID ONE OTHER EXPERIMENT
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50020 AND THERE'S A BUNCH OF DRUGS NOT VERY EXCITING
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50021 THEY HAVE A ROUGH IDEA OF HOW IT WORKS THEY HAVE A ROUGH IDEA OF WHAT THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50022 LET'S GO INTO THE STANFORD ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50023 BUT I'M SORRY WE STILL DON'T HAVE A PAPER BECAUSE THIS IS 10 PATIENTS AND GIVE ME A BREAK IT'S NOT ENOUGH PATIENTS
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50024 WHAT DO YOU DO
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50025 HE SAID WELL WE HAVE THE BING SEARCHES
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50026 I SAID NOW YOU'RE TALKING
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50027 5 TO ONE PERCENT OF ALL SEARCHES ON THE INTERNET INVOLVE ONE OF THOSE WORDS
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50028 IF PEOPLE TYPE IN PAROXETINE OR PAXIL THOSE ARE SYNONYMS AND ONE OF THOSE WORDS THE RATE GOES
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50029 HOW DO DRUGS WORK
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50030 BUT I STILL HAVE SIX AND A HALF MINUTES
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50031 HE DID THIS IN HIS PHD FOR HUNDREDS OF PAIRS OF DRUGS
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50032 HAVE THEY BEEN STUDIED WITH RESPECT TO THEIR NINE WAY INTERACTION
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50033 YES WE CAN DO PAIR WISE A AND B A AND C A AND D BUT WHAT ABOUT A B
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50034 WE NEED SECURE SYSTEMS
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50035 AND THE FINAL THING I WANT TO SAY IS IN THIS CASE WE FOUND TWO DRUGS AND IT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A SAD STORY
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50036 THE TWO DRUGS ACTUALLY CAUSED PROBLEMS
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50037 THEY INCREASED GLUCOSE
trainval/avuhY7D71sQ/50038 WE COULD HAVE FOUND TWO DRUGS OR THREE DRUGS THAT WERE INTERACTING IN A BENEFICIAL WAY
trainval/AWEpeW7Ojzs/50001 WELL WORKING WITH THE SAFE ORGANISMS THAT WE NORMALLY WORK WITH THE CHANCE OF AN
trainval/AwS1mOwx5gM/50001 THE HISTORY OF CIVILIZATION IN SOME WAYS IS A HISTORY OF MAPS HOW HAVE WE COME TO UNDERSTAND THE WORLD AROUND US
trainval/awtmTJW9ic8/50001 I WAS BROUGHT UP IN A FAMILY OF PSYCHOLOGISTS
trainval/awtmTJW9ic8/50002 AND YOUR HEALTH IS INCREDIBLY DEPENDENT UPON THE LIFE AND VIBRANCY OF THIS RAINFOREST
trainval/axAxSDq3rn8/50001 I'M GOING TO MAKE A BETTER HEADLIGHT
trainval/axAxSDq3rn8/50002 BUT I'M GOING TO DO IT BY MOVING THE LIGHT WHERE IT'S NEEDED
trainval/axAxSDq3rn8/50003 MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT
trainval/axAxSDq3rn8/50004 THAT'S HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE AROUND YOU
trainval/axAxSDq3rn8/50005 IT'S ACTUALLY SHOCKINGLY SMALL
trainval/axAxSDq3rn8/50006 WELL WE'RE NOT
trainval/axAxSDq3rn8/50007 THERE'S A NUMBER OF SURVEYS WHO TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT
trainval/axAxSDq3rn8/50008 SO IT'S BEEN TAKING A NUMBER OF DECADES TO GET WHERE THEY'RE AT
trainval/axAxSDq3rn8/50009 YOU CAN BE SEEN FROM THE SIDE
trainval/axAxSDq3rn8/50010 IT HAS DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS
trainval/axRSF7ku0Zg/50001 TOLD ME I COULDN'T DO IT BUT I DID
trainval/axRSF7ku0Zg/50002 BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT LEADERSHIP IS
trainval/ay8OMOsf6AQ/50001 THE CLOSER YOU MEASURE THE LONGER IT IS
trainval/aYBJayS6mTY/50001 OR DO YOU KEEP GOING
trainval/aYBJayS6mTY/50002 I WAS SO EXCITED TO GO
trainval/ayhhuxAu6rw/50001 SOME MAY SAY THAT THIS IS A FANTASY
trainval/ayhhuxAu6rw/50002 BUT I JUST KEPT TRYING
trainval/ayhhuxAu6rw/50003 NOW I'M NOT REALLY MODEL HEIGHT SO WHEN I GOT THERE AND I WAS SURROUNDED BY THESE GLAMOROUS AMAZONS I THOUGHT
trainval/ayhhuxAu6rw/50004 BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/ayhhuxAu6rw/50005 NONE COULD HOLD THEIR BREATH UNDERWATER
trainval/ayhhuxAu6rw/50006 SO ALL OF MY CHILDHOOD PRACTICE CAME IN HANDY AND I GOT THE JOB
trainval/ayhhuxAu6rw/50007 SO I HAD TO CREATE EVERYTHING FROM SCRATCH
trainval/ayhhuxAu6rw/50008 SO I DECIDED I WAS GOING TO START WORKING WITH UNDERWATER PHOTOGRAPHERS
trainval/ayhhuxAu6rw/50009 ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING EXPERIENCES I EVER HAD WAS SWIMMING WITH A HUMPBACK WHALE AND HER
trainval/ayhhuxAu6rw/50010 BACK ON LAND MY JOY BEGAN TO TURN TO HORROR AND DISMAY AS I REALIZED THAT THESE
trainval/ayhhuxAu6rw/50011 THAT WOULD HAVE INCREDIBLY DIRE CONSEQUENCES FOR OUR ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM
trainval/ayhhuxAu6rw/50012 BY BRIDGING LAND AND SEA AS A MERMAID WITH A CAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO APPEAL TO PEOPLE'S
trainval/ayVm441iZfo/50001 BUT IT GOT MY ATTENTION AND SO I DID SOME RESEARCH
trainval/ayVm441iZfo/50002 SO I TALKED TO MY HUSBAND AND WE THOUGHT WELL FEBRUARY
trainval/ayVm441iZfo/50003 WELL THE DAY OF THE ECLIPSE FOUND US AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE OUT BEHIND THE HYATT REGENCY ON THE BEACH
trainval/ayVm441iZfo/50004 I MEAN THE DAY REMAINED BRIGHT
trainval/ayVm441iZfo/50005 WELL SOON IT WAS OBVIOUS IT WAS GETTING DARK
trainval/ayVm441iZfo/50006 I STUDIED PHYSICS IN COLLEGE
trainval/ayVm441iZfo/50007 I USED TO BE A SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT FOR NPR
trainval/ayVm441iZfo/50008 AND THE ASTRONOMER I INTERVIEWED HIM AND HE EXPLAINED WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AND HOW TO VIEW IT
trainval/ayVm441iZfo/50009 UNFORTUNATELY FEW AMERICANS HAVE SEEN ONE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN 38 YEARS SINCE ONE LAST TOUCHED THE
trainval/ayVm441iZfo/50010 I DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD
trainval/ayVm441iZfo/50011 YOU MIGHT CHASE SOMETHING ELSE
trainval/AyWtIwwEgS0/50001 WE'RE THEN READY TO FIGHT FOR A BIGGER ONE
trainval/AyWtIwwEgS0/50002 THIS CREATES TENSIONS AND SERIOUS CONFLICTS
trainval/AyWtIwwEgS0/50003 LET'S TAKE FASHION RETAIL
trainval/AyWtIwwEgS0/50004 MOST OF THEM ARE IN GREAT DIFFICULTIES TODAY
trainval/AyWtIwwEgS0/50005 GLOBALIZATION WILL ENTER A NEW ERA
trainval/AyWtIwwEgS0/50006 IN MOST COUNTRIES LIKE IN MY COUNTRY FRANCE WE'VE TOLD OUR CHILDREN THAT MANUFACTURING HAD NO FUTURE
trainval/AYzA2uyd9Ss/50001 YOU SHOULD COME AND FILM IT
trainval/AYzA2uyd9Ss/50002 VAPORWAVE IS MORE THAN AN ART FORM
trainval/AYzA2uyd9Ss/50003 BUT ANYWAY SUNRISE MALL WAS USED IN THE FILM AS A FILMING LOCATION
trainval/AYzA2uyd9Ss/50004 IT'S LIKE A MOVEMENT
trainval/AzcMEwAxSP8/50001 SO WHAT'S THE OTHER 95
trainval/AzcMEwAxSP8/50002 HOW DO WE CURE IT
trainval/AzcMEwAxSP8/50003 WHAT IS GRAVITY
trainval/AzcMEwAxSP8/50004 WHAT MAKES MARKETS WORK
trainval/AzcMEwAxSP8/50005 THERE ARE SO MANY QUESTIONS THAT WE STILL DON'T KNOW
trainval/AzcMEwAxSP8/50006 AND I SAID WHAT
trainval/AzcMEwAxSP8/50007 SO I WENT AND I INTERVIEWED HIM AND I RECORDED THIS CONVERSATION THAT I HAD WITH HIM
trainval/AzcMEwAxSP8/50008 AND AT THE SAME TIME I WAS LOOKING ON THE INTERNET PEOPLE WERE REALLY EXPERIMENTING WITH YOUTUBE VIDEOS AND TAKING RECORDINGS AND MAKING
trainval/AzcMEwAxSP8/50009 HE DIDN'T WAIT AROUND FOR THE PRESS RELEASE
trainval/AzcMEwAxSP8/50010 HE DIDN'T WAIT AROUND FOR THE REPORTER TO COME CALLING
trainval/AzW2iKdSITM/50001 I SIMPLY WANT TO STAY IN BED
trainval/AzW2iKdSITM/50002 OUR PREFERENCES CHANGE AS WELL
trainval/AzW2iKdSITM/50003 I MAY DECIDE THAT THE DISCOMFORT OF GETTING OUT OF BED EARLY IS LESS
trainval/aZWxtQ19JsE/50001 IT MAKES YOU THINK OF AUTUMN
trainval/aZWxtQ19JsE/50002 AND WHAT IF YOU GET INTO A CAREER THAT'S IN TECHNOLOGY
trainval/aZWxtQ19JsE/50003 SO THOSE ARE VERY IMPORTANT THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT THE KIDS SHOULD BE REALLY PUTTING
trainval/aZWxtQ19JsE/50004 THEY NEED TO DO THAT
trainval/aZWxtQ19JsE/50005 THERE'S ALSO SOLAR CAR RACES
trainval/aZWxtQ19JsE/50006 SO I ENCOURAGE YOU TO GET YOUR KIDS INTO THESE COMPETITIONS THEY'RE WONDERFUL COMPETITIONS THEY CAN STRETCH THEIR MINDS
trainval/B0ESVNX1SYk/50001 IT CAN HAPPEN IN DIFFERENT WAYS OF COURSE AND USUALLY COMES IN STAGES
trainval/B0ESVNX1SYk/50002 JUST AS THERE WAS A POINT IN YOUR DEVELOPMENT AS A CHILD WHEN YOU SENSE OF SELF AND OF
trainval/B0ESVNX1SYk/50003 WE EACH LIVE IN THE SHADOW OF A PERSONAL APOCALYPSE
trainval/B0ESVNX1SYk/50004 I USED TO WATCH A CHILDREN'S NEWS PROGRAMME AT THE TIME AND THIS WAS THE ERA OF SPACE EXPLORATION
trainval/B0ESVNX1SYk/50005 THERE WERE ALWAYS ROCKETS GOING UP INTO THE SKY UP INTO SPACE GOING UP THERE
trainval/B0ESVNX1SYk/50006 NOW A BIAS IS A WAY IN WHICH WE SYSTEMATICALLY GET THINGS WRONG WAYS IN WHICH WE
trainval/B0ESVNX1SYk/50007 AND THE BIAS I AM TALKING ABOUT WORKS LIKE THIS
trainval/B0ESVNX1SYk/50008 AND EVERY TIME YOU GET THE SAME RESULT
trainval/B0ESVNX1SYk/50009 TWICE AS LIKELY
trainval/B0ESVNX1SYk/50010 AND THE IDEA IS SIMPLE IT'S JUST THIS
trainval/B0ESVNX1SYk/50011 SO THOSE ARE THE FOUR BASIC KINDS OF IMMORTALITY STORIES AND I'VE TRIED TO GIVE JUST SOME SENSE OF HOW THEY'RE
trainval/B0ESVNX1SYk/50012 AND SO IT SHOULD BE WITH US
trainval/B0ESVNX1SYk/50013 AND YOU NEEDN'T WORRY HOW LONG THE BOOK IS OR WHETHER IT'S A COMIC STRIP OR AN EPIC
trainval/B0YSGU3JqiQ/50001 IT'S KIND OF IN THIS AREA THAT I BECAME VERY INTERESTED IN INTRIGUED WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
trainval/B0YSGU3JqiQ/50002 IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES
trainval/B0YSGU3JqiQ/50003 HOW DO WE DO IT WITH A DOG
trainval/B0YSGU3JqiQ/50005 BECAUSE IF YOU BELIEVE PAVLOV AND ALL THE BEHAVIORIST WHO FOLLOWED HIM IT REALLY SHOULDN'T MATTER
trainval/B12syeJflbQ/50001 SHE NEVER LEARNED TO SWIM
trainval/B12syeJflbQ/50002 WE WILL MAKE IT TO SWEDEN WE WILL GET MARRIED AND WE WILL HAVE A FUTURE
trainval/B12syeJflbQ/50003 AROUND THEM THERE WERE CORPSES
trainval/B12syeJflbQ/50005 I DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE ANYMORE
trainval/B12syeJflbQ/50006 I WILL NOT SURVIVE
trainval/B12syeJflbQ/50007 SHE WANTS TO REUNITE WITH HER FAMILY THERE
trainval/B12syeJflbQ/50008 SHE WANTS TO BRING HER MOTHER AND HER FATHER AND HER YOUNGER
trainval/B1dkma6GRZo/50001 AFTER I GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE I'M GOING TO GO INTO THE WORLD OF THEATER BUT WHEN I'M NOT WORKING AT A THEATER COMPANY
trainval/B1dkma6GRZo/50002 I LIVE HERE IN IOWA
trainval/B1dkma6GRZo/50003 I CAN GIVE TO ANYONE
trainval/B1dkma6GRZo/50004 WE WERE WALKING ALONG COURT AVENUE WE GET TO THE COURT AVENUE BRIDGE AND HE'S HOLDING MY HAND WHICH I WAS SO
trainval/B1dkma6GRZo/50005 I KNEW SOMETHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN
trainval/B1dkma6GRZo/50006 OR WOULD THAT MAKE ME A COWARD
trainval/B1dkma6GRZo/50007 NOTICE THAT I'M UP HERE AS A CISGENDERED WHITE MALE WHO'S VERY COMFORTABLE IDENTIFYING AS A MALE
trainval/b1sQZxrBMXk/50001 CAN YOU EXPRESS THAT IN MUSIC
trainval/b1sQZxrBMXk/50002 START WITH FIVE OK
trainval/b1sQZxrBMXk/50003 BUT REALLY WHAT CAN IT EXPRESS
trainval/b1sQZxrBMXk/50004 AND IF YOU MOVE ANY SLOWER THAN THAT THEN YOU'RE MOVING TOO SLOW ANY FURTHER THAN THAT AND YOU'RE JUST DREAMING
trainval/b1sQZxrBMXk/50005 SO CAN WE EXPRESS THIS IDEA THAT MAGICAL MOMENT OF WHERE THE PRACTICAL MEETS THE POSSIBLE
trainval/b28brIs1OmM/50001 TRUTH BE TOLD I HAVE NEVER FOUND A ROLE MODEL I COULD TRULY IDENTIFY WITH
trainval/b28brIs1OmM/50002 WELL WHAT EXACTLY IS RESILIENCE AND HOW DO YOU DEVELOP IT
trainval/b28brIs1OmM/50003 SHE MOSTLY EXISTS FOR HER FAMILY
trainval/b28brIs1OmM/50004 BUT THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT SURVIVING IN YOUR DUAL ROLE AS A CAREER WOMAN AND MOTHER
trainval/b28brIs1OmM/50005 MY HOPES FOR MY SON ARE THAT BY THEN THE EXPRESSION HER MOTHER'S SON OR MAMA'S BOY WOULD HAVE TAKEN ON A
trainval/b2LbuqoNGGI/50001 AND COMPANIES KNOW THIS
trainval/b2LbuqoNGGI/50002 AND COMPUTER NETWORKING WHICH SPAWNED COMPANIES LIKE 3 COM AND CISCO AND MADE THE INTERNET POSSIBLE
trainval/b2LbuqoNGGI/50003 AND YOU SEE THIS TODAY
trainval/b2LbuqoNGGI/50004 IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE
trainval/b2LbuqoNGGI/50005 THERE ARE A FEW PLACES IN THE WORLD ARE REALLY GOOD AT KEEPING THEM ALIVE
trainval/b2MSSeKey4o/50001 I MEAN NINE YEARS IS A LONG TIME
trainval/b2MSSeKey4o/50002 SO ME AND ALL MY FRIENDS WOULD RUN HOME EVERY DAY AND WATCH JEOPARDY
trainval/b2MSSeKey4o/50003 I WAS ALWAYS THAT KIND OF OBSESSED TRIVIA KID
trainval/b2MSSeKey4o/50004 I HAD TAKEN SOME ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CLASSES
trainval/b2MSSeKey4o/50005 WATSON'S ACTUALLY HUGE
trainval/b2MSSeKey4o/50006 THEY WERE EXACTLY RIGHT
trainval/b2MSSeKey4o/50007 THE ADVANTAGE OF VOLUME FIRST JUST HAS TO DO WITH THE COMPLEXITY OF THE WORLD NOWADAYS
trainval/b2MSSeKey4o/50008 THERE'S SO MUCH INFORMATION OUT THERE
trainval/b2MSSeKey4o/50009 WHAT SHOULD I MAJOR IN
trainval/b2MSSeKey4o/50010 WHO DO I VOTE FOR
trainval/b2MSSeKey4o/50011 I'VE MET A LOT OF THEM
trainval/b2qM1ISJCEQ/50001 I WANT TO TELL YOU FOUR JOKES TODAY
trainval/b2qM1ISJCEQ/50002 THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT
trainval/b2qM1ISJCEQ/50003 LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE'RE ABOUT TO MAKE A LANDING ON THE WATER
trainval/b2qM1ISJCEQ/50004 WHY DID YOU JUST LAUGH
trainval/b2qM1ISJCEQ/50005 SO LET'S TRY AGAIN
trainval/b2qM1ISJCEQ/50006 I WROTE IT THIS MORNING
trainval/b3H9V1jq0A8/50001 IT WOULD JUST BE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THE DATA
trainval/b3H9V1jq0A8/50002 BUT WE KNOW FROM NUMEROUS SOCIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES THAT IQ ITSELF IS IN FACT HIGHLY
trainval/b3H9V1jq0A8/50003 EACH GROUP SAW THE OTHER AS AN ATTACK ON THEM AS SOMETHING THAT MADE THEM QUESTION WHETHER THEY
trainval/b3H9V1jq0A8/50004 YOU CAN THINK ABOUT RENAISSANCE FLORENCE YOU CAN THINK ABOUT PARIS IN THE YEARS JUST BEFORE AND AFTER WORLD WAR
trainval/B4a0NvLTebw/50001 I WAS GOING TO WORK ON THE SECOND ONE NEXT
trainval/B4a0NvLTebw/50002 NUMBER ONE I DON'T HAVE AN INDIAN ACCENT I HAVE A PAKISTANI ACCENT OK
trainval/b4kSKPELNcc/50001 NOW OUR DISCOVERY POINTS US TOWARDS BETTER WAYS TO SUSTAINABLY MANAGE CORAL REEFS BUT IT ALSO SHOWS
trainval/b4kSKPELNcc/50002 BUT COPYING BEHAVIOR IS ALSO COMMON IN WILD ANIMALS
trainval/b4sMMWJYUOs/50001 WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THAT THIS CORN WAS NOT ENGINEERED TO TASTE BETTER OR TO GIVE YOU MORE NUTRIENTS OR TO BE
trainval/b4sMMWJYUOs/50002 SOUNDS LIKE A TASTY AFTER SCHOOL SNACK TO YOU
trainval/b4sMMWJYUOs/50003 NEW AND IMPROVED
trainval/b4sMMWJYUOs/50004 MEANWHILE THE ORGANIC FARMER IS HELD LIABLE TO FIX THE PROBLEM
trainval/b4sMMWJYUOs/50005 THIS STUDY WAS DONE BY THE JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
trainval/b4sMMWJYUOs/50006 AS OF TODAY
trainval/b4sMMWJYUOs/50007 IT ALL STARTED WITH MY SPEECH IN GRADE SIX TO INFORM MY CLASSMATES
trainval/b4sMMWJYUOs/50008 I FOUNDED A NON PROFIT ORGANIZATION CALLED KIDS RIGHT TO KNOW
trainval/b4sMMWJYUOs/50009 CANADA AND THE US ARE THE ONLY TWO INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS IN THE WORLD THAT DON'T REQUIRE MANDATORY
trainval/b4sMMWJYUOs/50010 ANYONE WHO WAS MARCHING AGAINST MONSANTO WAS STUPID
trainval/b4sMMWJYUOs/50012 I WATCHED PEOPLE PURCHASE LARGE AMOUNTS OF CHIPS DIPS SODAS AND LEMONADES WITHOUT EVER KNOWING THE INGREDIENTS HAD BEEN
trainval/B4xOFsygwr4/50001 SO SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS WE MADE AS TO WHAT WE MIGHT WANT TO DO AFTER LUNCH WERE A LITTLE BIT IMPRACTICAL AND AFTER A WHILE SOMEONE MADE A
trainval/B4xOFsygwr4/50002 I JUST POLITELY RAISED MY HAND AND WHEN MS
trainval/B4xOFsygwr4/50003 IT IS SUCH A THRILL FOR A HUMBLE BREAKFAST RADIO ANNOUNCER FROM SYDNEY AUSTRALIA TO BE HERE
trainval/B4xOFsygwr4/50004 THEY KEEP GOING ON FOREVER
trainval/B4xOFsygwr4/50005 IT TOOK FOCUS
trainval/B4xOFsygwr4/50006 IT TOOK DEDICATION
trainval/B4xOFsygwr4/50007 I WAS TORN BETWEEN MATHEMATICS AND MEDIA
trainval/B4xOFsygwr4/50008 IT WAS A TOUGH DECISION
trainval/B4xOFsygwr4/50009 DS I'M AS DUMB AS A BOX OF HAMMERS
trainval/B4xOFsygwr4/50010 MY SKILL IS NOT IN THE MATHEMATICS
trainval/B4xOFsygwr4/50011 FRANK NELSON COLE DID NOT STOP THERE
trainval/B4xOFsygwr4/50012 THERE WAS A TWEET ADAM HAVE YOU SEEN THE NEW LARGEST PRIME NUMBER
trainval/B4xOFsygwr4/50013 WE'RE NOT TALKING POLITICS TODAY
trainval/B4xOFsygwr4/50015 HE WENT ON AND ON AND CALCULATED 67 POWERS OF TWO
trainval/B4xOFsygwr4/50016 THAT FILLS ME WITH ALMOST SEXUAL EXCITEMENT
trainval/B4xOFsygwr4/50017 TO TYPE IT IN ITS ABBREVIATED FORM AND THEN ONLY ABOUT SIX LINES OF CODE IS THE TEST FOR
trainval/B4xOFsygwr4/50018 WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT ROBOTS IN THIS TED
trainval/B4xOFsygwr4/50019 WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN AND CAN'T DO
trainval/B4xOFsygwr4/50020 I WAS ASKED IN AN INTERVIEW LAST YEAR IN MY CAPACITY AS A LOWER CASE C CELEBRITY IN AUSTRALIA WHAT WAS YOUR
trainval/B4xOFsygwr4/50021 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A POLITICIAN
trainval/B4xOFsygwr4/50022 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BREAKTHROUGH
trainval/B4xOFsygwr4/50023 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BOOK I READ THE ARTS
trainval/B4xOFsygwr4/50024 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING MY TWO GORGEOUS DAUGHTERS HAD DONE
trainval/B4xOFsygwr4/50025 NO IT WASN'T
trainval/B4xOFsygwr4/50026 THAT'S WHAT IS SO EXCITING FOR ME ABOUT THIS PRIME NUMBER
trainval/B5MkpzMAOZM/50001 THEY ANSWERED MY PHONE
trainval/B5MkpzMAOZM/50002 I WANTED TO SEE HOW DRESSING BIBLICALLY AFFECTED MY MIND
trainval/B5MkpzMAOZM/50003 I WANTED IT TO BE ABOUT RELIGION IN AMERICA
trainval/B5MkpzMAOZM/50004 AND THEY WOULD SAY WELL WHAT ABOUT YOU
trainval/B5MkpzMAOZM/50005 I'VE HAD SOME GREAT MEALS AT CAFETERIAS
trainval/b64qvG2Jgro/50001 BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THIS KIND OF THING HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AND IT AFFECTS NOT JUST THE
trainval/b64qvG2Jgro/50002 SO I WENT TO THE COMPANY'S WEBSITE LOOKING TO FIND SOME CONTROLLED TRIALS OF THEIR PRODUCTS
trainval/b64qvG2Jgro/50003 LIKE JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO NEUROSCIENTISTS AT MIT FIGURED OUT HOW TO BREAK HABITS IN
trainval/b64qvG2Jgro/50004 BUT THE PROMISE OF NEUROSCIENCE HAS LED TO SOME REALLY HIGH EXPECTATIONS AND SOME
trainval/b64qvG2Jgro/50005 NOW THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS LINE OF REASONING AND THAT'S THAT THE INSULA DOES A LOT
trainval/b64qvG2Jgro/50006 MY COLLEAGUES TAL YARKONI AND RUSS POLDRACK HAVE SHOWN THAT THE INSULA POPS UP IN ALMOST A
trainval/b64qvG2Jgro/50007 A LOT OF PEOPLE AGREE
trainval/b64qvG2Jgro/50008 MAYBE SOMEDAY WE WILL BUT UNTIL THEN WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL THAT WE DON'T LET OVERBLOWN CLAIMS DETRACT
trainval/b64qvG2Jgro/50009 ASK FOR THE PART OF THE STORY THAT'S NOT BEING TOLD
trainval/b6rAgHcuYtE/50001 BUT WHAT I WANT TO SUGGEST TO YOU TODAY IS THAT A PURELY CONSUMER BASED RESPONSE TO THIS PROBLEM ON
trainval/b6rAgHcuYtE/50002 THEY GET TO KNOW THE BORROWER FACE TO FACE
trainval/b6rAgHcuYtE/50003 SO MUCH SO THAT WHEN IT STUMBLED AND FOUND ITSELF TEETERING ON THE VERGE OF BANKRUPTCY PARLIAMENT
trainval/b6rAgHcuYtE/50004 MILLIONS OF JOBS IN MANUFACTURING AND SMALL BUSINESSES ARE GONE AND ALL WE'VE GOTTEN IN EXCHANGE ARE VERY LOW
trainval/b6rAgHcuYtE/50005 AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES ARE AMONG THE LOWEST IN THE COUNTRY
trainval/b6rAgHcuYtE/50006 IT'S NOT THE PRODUCT OF SOME KIND OF NATURAL EVOLUTION
trainval/b6rAgHcuYtE/50007 IT'S THE LOGICAL OUTCOME OF A SET OF POLICIES
trainval/b6rAgHcuYtE/50008 WE'RE PLANNING TO KEEP IT ON OUR BOOKS FOR 30 YEARS
trainval/b6rAgHcuYtE/50009 SO HE WENT TO THE WEBSITE OF LONGFELLOW BOOKS
trainval/b6rAgHcuYtE/50010 MY LOCAL BOOKSTORE IN PORTLAND
trainval/b6rAgHcuYtE/50011 IT'S COMING FROM ARIZONA
trainval/b6rAgHcuYtE/50012 IT'S GOING TO SOUTH CAROLINA
trainval/b6rAgHcuYtE/50013 IT DOESN'T HAVE MY NAME ON IT
trainval/b6rAgHcuYtE/50014 I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ORDER
trainval/b6rAgHcuYtE/50015 I JUST HAD A QUESTION ABOUT IT
trainval/b6rAgHcuYtE/50016 IS THIS BOOK FOR STACY MITCHELL
trainval/b6rAgHcuYtE/50017 THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS
trainval/b6rAgHcuYtE/50018 JUST IMAGE IF WE TOOK A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE SAVINGS AND REDIRECTED IT TO NEW INITIATIVES TO GROW
trainval/B7c0W5FZw64/50001 SO I DECIDED TO CONDUCT MY OWN LITTLE EXPERIMENT
trainval/B8ofWFx525s/50001 IT MEANT A CONNECTION TO THE WORLD
trainval/B8Z2G7d2kzs/50001 ACTUALLY IT WAS A VERY HARD CHALLENGE
trainval/B8Z2G7d2kzs/50002 WHEN YOU HAVE 3
trainval/B8Z2G7d2kzs/50003 YOU CAN FIND ORIGINAL WAYS TO GET THINGS DONE
trainval/B8Z2G7d2kzs/50004 ACTUALLY YOU'RE LOOKING AT A GUY WHO HAS THE BEST JOB IN THE WORLD
trainval/b8z6HfSq7l8/50001 BUT FOR THE MOMENT SINCE WE HAVE FOUND NO EVIDENCE FOR NEW PHENOMENA LET US SUPPOSE
trainval/b8z6HfSq7l8/50002 BUT THIS STORY IS FAR MORE INTERESTING THAN THAT
trainval/B905LapVP7I/50001 SO EVEN THE SMARTEST HIGHEST PAID PEOPLE WILL BE AFFECTED BY THIS CHANGE
trainval/B905LapVP7I/50002 BUT I BELIEVE THAT IF WE START TAKING STEPS RIGHT NOW TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF WORK WE CAN NOT ONLY CREATE
trainval/B905LapVP7I/50003 BUT SECOND WE HAVE ACCIDENTALLY MADE IT SO THAT MILLIONS OF WORKERS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE UNBELIEVABLY
trainval/B905LapVP7I/50004 WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THESE JOBS WHEN WE'RE NO LONGER DRIVING OUR CARS OR COOKING OUR FOOD OR EVEN DIAGNOSING OUR OWN
trainval/B905LapVP7I/50005 THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW AND WHAT THEY DO ON SATURDAYS
trainval/B905LapVP7I/50006 THEY'RE ARTISTS CARPENTERS CHEFS AND ATHLETES
trainval/B905LapVP7I/50007 SO MY TEAM AND I DESIGNED A PROTOTYPING CONTEST THAT INVITED ANYONE TO BUILD ANYTHING THAT THEY WANTED
trainval/B905LapVP7I/50008 AND THE RESULTS OF THE PROGRAM WERE AMAZING
trainval/B905LapVP7I/50009 WE STARTED BY INVITING PEOPLE TO REENVISION WHAT IT IS THEY COULD BRING TO A TEAM
trainval/B905LapVP7I/50010 AND IT'S NOT JUST BLUE COLLAR JOBS THAT ARE AT RISK
trainval/B905LapVP7I/50011 AND AS WE REDESIGN WORK FOR AN ERA OF INTELLIGENT MACHINES I INVITE YOU ALL TO WORK ALONGSIDE ME TO BRING MORE
trainval/B9DdIivSGts/50001 BUT IT'S OFTEN THOSE THAT ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SUPPORT THAT WE ACTUALLY DON'T ASK
trainval/B9DdIivSGts/50002 DESPITE ALL THESE CHALLENGES THEY FACED THEY WERE TRYING TO HELP THEIR CHILDREN
trainval/B9DdIivSGts/50003 TO HAVE THAT IN MANCHESTER WOULD BE A HUGE ACHIEVEMENT LET ALONE IN A CONFLICT ZONE IN SYRIA
trainval/B9DdIivSGts/50004 HALA SIMPLY COULD NO LONGER COPE
trainval/B9DdIivSGts/50005 BUT BY IMPROVING PARENTING AND CAREGIVER SUPPORT IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO WEAKEN THE LINKS
trainval/b9fqIoZoQJE/50001 AND IN FACT I HAD KIND OF MISSED THE BOAT BECAUSE IN 1990 UNESCO HAD RECOGNIZED THE SAME
trainval/b9jb9UjCpik/50001 THEY SAY WHAT DID THE DOCTOR SAY
trainval/b9jb9UjCpik/50002 OF COURSE I WAS INTERESTED IN THE OPINIONS OF DOCTORS AND
trainval/b9jb9UjCpik/50003 AND THE CURRENT STRATEGY SPANS THE WHOLE WORLD AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF HUMAN HISTORY
trainval/b9jb9UjCpik/50004 OBVIOUSLY THERE WERE
trainval/B9kg1UdzDvw/50001 WHO POPS INTO YOUR MIND RIGHT NOW
trainval/BA8XOF6IpXA/50001 AND IN THE END I WILL GO TO THE MOST CRUCIAL QUESTION I THINK FOR TODAY
trainval/BA8XOF6IpXA/50002 AND THEN CAME ROBOTS
trainval/BA8XOF6IpXA/50003 AND THEY HAVE PARTIALLY PRODUCED SOME FRUIT
trainval/BA8XOF6IpXA/50004 ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENTS WE THINK IN THAT RESPECT IS TO BE ABLE TO HARNESS
trainval/BA8XOF6IpXA/50005 THEN WE TALKED ABOUT INDIVIDUAL INTELLIGENCE AND COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE
trainval/BA8XOF6IpXA/50006 AND YOU WERE EVEN ABLE TO ACTUALLY GET PREDICTIONS FROM WHAT IS HAPPENING THROUGH THIS ANALYSIS OF PUBLIC OPINION
trainval/bB5zR2xYhm4/50001 AND SHE DID
trainval/bB5zR2xYhm4/50002 SHE RAN AND MANAGED TO ESCAPE
trainval/bbFF5n7S930/50001 IT'S PROBABLY ALSO HEALTHY
trainval/bbFF5n7S930/50002 FIRST OF ALL
trainval/bbFF5n7S930/50003 LET ME GIVE YOU AN INTERESTING EXAMPLE
trainval/bbFF5n7S930/50004 YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT WAS STORED THEIR STABILITY ISSUES
trainval/bbFF5n7S930/50005 IT MUST BE GOOD FOR ME
trainval/bbFF5n7S930/50006 IN WHAT QUANTITY
trainval/bbFF5n7S930/50007 AND NATURAL DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN SOMETHING IS HEALTHY
trainval/BBSVLGf7zPI/50001 THIS WAS STAGGERING
trainval/BBSVLGf7zPI/50002 WHEN LASH AFFIRMED MY CALCULATIONS THE FIRST SALVO OF THE FRACKING
trainval/BBSVLGf7zPI/50003 WITHOUT THEIR EFFORTS THIS WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE
trainval/BBSVLGf7zPI/50004 WHAT IF I WERE RIGHT
trainval/BBSVLGf7zPI/50005 WHY IS THAT
trainval/BBSVLGf7zPI/50006 BECAUSE METHANE IS A GREENHOUSE GAS HOWEVER THE HALF
trainval/BBSVLGf7zPI/50007 LET ME ILLUSTRATE THIS FOR YOU
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50001 THEY'RE IN THERE SOMEWHERE RIGHT
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50002 RIB CAGE IS PRETTY BIG
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50003 LET THEM BE DOWN AND BACK
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50004 ON YOUR INHALES LET WHATEVER IT IS THAT IS CONFUSING YOU OR THAT IS CLUTTERING YOUR BRAIN
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50005 AND THEN ON YOUR EXHALES START TO CONSCIOUSLY LET THOSE THOUGHTS GO
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50006 SO I WANT EVERYONE TO PUT YOUR GLASSES DOWN WHATEVER YOU'RE HOLDING
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50007 SO SOMETIMES WE WANT OUR BREATH TO FUEL OUR HEARTS SOMETIMES WE WANT IT TO FUEL PARTS OF OUR
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50008 YOU CAN RELAX YOUR HANDS DOWN
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50009 I WANT TO WORK A LITTLE BIT ON GROUNDING
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50010 SO SAY YOU'RE AT YOUR DESK
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50011 SO BEING IN YOUR BODY IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS IT IS TO BE IN YOUR BRAIN AS IT IS TO BE IN YOUR HEART
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50012 SO I WANT YOU TO STAND IN A WAY THAT GROUNDS YOU
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50013 YOU CAN DO THIS EVEN IN YOUR FANCY SHOES I'VE DONE IT
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50014 MY NAME IS RACHAEL AND I'M A FORREST YOGA TEACHER BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT KIND OF YOGA I TEACH
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50015 SO LIFT AND SPREAD YOUR TOES
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50016 YOU CAN GET YOUR FEET ON THE GROUND AND YOUR TOES LIFTED AND SPREAD YOU CAN GET AWARE OF THE HEART
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50017 SO STAY RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE MAYBE RELAX YOUR HANDS AGAIN
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50018 RELAX YOUR SHOULDERS DOWN AND BACK
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50019 THIS IS MY VERY FAVORITE FORREST YOGA POSITION AND IT'S BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE SITTING AT YOUR
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50020 HUGE BREATH INTO THE BACK OF THE HEART
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50021 FILL UP THE BACK OF THE HEART
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50022 WE ALL BREATHE
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50023 I'M HAPPY TO TEACH THESE TO YOU AT ANY TIME ANY DAY
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50024 CALL ME UP I'LL TALK YOU THROUGH IT
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50025 SO THE LAST THING I WANT TO COVER THIS EVENING GOES BACK TO HANDS ON THE RIBS
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50026 SO BRING YOUR HANDS BACK TO YOUR RIBS
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50027 ALL GREAT IDEAS START WITH PASSION RIGHT
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50028 PASSION IS CENTERED RIGHT HERE IN THE HEART
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50029 AND THAT OFTEN IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE SAYING WHAT IS IT THAT I'M ACTUALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50030 THAT'S WHERE THE REAL POWER LIES RIGHT
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50031 EXHALING SLIGHTLY PULLING IN THAT LOW BELLY
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50032 WE MIGHT AS WELL GET A LITTLE CORE STRENGTH WHILE WE ARE AT IT RIGHT
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50033 ANOTHER BIG BREATH LIKE THAT
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50034 AND SO I WANT YOU TO TAKE YOUR HANDS AND BRING THEM TO YOUR RIBS
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50035 WHAT WE'RE DOING IS MOVING THE DIAPHRAGM WHICH ACTUALLY IS THE STRONGEST MUSCLE IN THE BODY WE'RE
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50036 LET'S TAKE THREE MORE BIG BREATHS LIKE THAT
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50037 CLOSE YOUR EYES
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50038 PICTURE THAT DIAPHRAGM MOVING
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50039 SO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO FEEL YOUR RIBS
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50040 AND THEN WITH YOUR NEXT TWO BREATHS I'M GOING TO COUNT THEM OUT
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50041 EXHALE SLOWLY MORE SLOWLY
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50042 LET IT ALL OUT
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50043 FILL YOUR CHEST
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50044 FEEL YOUR HANDS EXPAND
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50045 HOLD THE BREATH
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50046 RELAX THE SHOULDERS
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50047 I WANT YOU ALL TO FEEL EMPOWERED
trainval/bbT8jSPS2LA/50048 AND THE BREATH IS ONE OF THE BEST TOOLS THAT I'VE FOUND TO BE ABLE TO BE IN OUR BODIES BE
trainval/Bc2wVyl8RLI/50001 I DON'T WANT AN AD IN THE NEW YORKER AND MOST OF THESE WORKERS DON'T REALLY WANT IPHONES
trainval/Bc2wVyl8RLI/50002 HOW MUCH MONEY CAN I SAVE
trainval/Bc2wVyl8RLI/50003 I THANKED HER ASSUMING IT WAS FAKE LIKE ALMOST EVERYTHING ELSE FOR SALE IN DONGGUAN
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50001 THESE THINGS ARE SHOWN TO BE PRETTY EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF GETTING PEOPLE TO SLOW DOWN
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50002 THEY REDUCE SPEEDS BY ABOUT FIVE TO 10 PERCENT
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50003 IT GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO ARISTOTLE
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50004 I MEAN THEY COMPLAIN ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50005 WE TALK ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF ENGAGEMENT OR NON COMPLIANCE
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50006 NOT A LOT OF COOL SEXY STUFF HAPPENING IN DENTISTRY
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50007 IT'S THE ONE GREAT PREVENTIVE HEALTH SUCCESS WE HAVE IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50008 PEOPLE BRUSH AND FLOSS THEIR TEETH
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50009 THEY DON'T DO IT AS MUCH AS THEY SHOULD BUT THEY DO IT
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50010 SO THIS IS AN OLD EXPERIMENT BUT IT'S A REALLY GOOD ONE BECAUSE IT WAS VERY SIMPLE SO IT'S AN EASY STORY TO TELL
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50011 SO THESE CONNECTICUT DENTISTS DECIDED THAT THEY WANTED TO GET PEOPLE TO BRUSH THEIR TEETH AND FLOSS THEIR TEETH MORE OFTEN AND
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50012 THEY WANTED TO TELL THEM HOW BAD IT WOULD BE IF THEY DIDN'T BRUSH AND FLOSS THEIR TEETH
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50014 THEY DIVIDED THEM UP INTO TWO GROUPS
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50015 IF YOU GET GUM DISEASE YOU WILL LOSE YOUR TEETH BUT YOU'LL GET DENTURES AND IT WON'T BE THAT BAD
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50016 SO THAT WAS THE LOW FEAR GROUP
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50017 AND THE PEOPLE WHO SAID YEAH YEAH
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50018 IT WAS THE SENSE OF EFFICACY
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50019 IT'S AN AMAZING NOTION
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50020 SO FEAR DOESN'T WORK RIGHT
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50021 FEAR DOESN'T WORK
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50022 AGAIN BANDURA RECOGNIZED THIS YEARS AGO DECADES AGO
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50023 BUT IT ACTUALLY HITS HOME
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50024 IT'S NOT JUST HITTING US IN OUR HEADS IT'S HITTING US IN OUR HEARTS
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50025 THERE'S AN EMOTIONAL CONNECTION TO INFORMATION BECAUSE IT'S FROM US
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50026 BUT WE'RE NOT USING IT
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50027 IT'S JUST SITTING THERE
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50028 BUT YOU CAN CREATE YOUR OWN FEEDBACK LOOP
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50029 ANYBODY CAN CREATE THEIR FEEDBACK LOOP BY ASKING THESE SIMPLE QUESTIONS CAN I HAVE MY RESULTS
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50030 BECAUSE WE KNOW
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50031 WHO AMONG US WOULD ACTUALLY SAY THAT PEOPLE READ THIS
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50032 YOU CAN UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50033 YOU CAN START TO UNPACK THE CHOICES INVOLVED BECAUSE OF THE SIDE EFFECTS
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50034 THEY GO RIGHT TO DOCTORS
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50035 WE TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE OKAY YOU'RE NORMAL
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50036 BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO WADE THROUGH IT
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50037 THEN WE USE THE INFORMATION THAT'S ALREADY IN THE LAB REPORT
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50038 WE AGAIN PERSONALIZED THE RISKS
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50039 SO THIS PATIENT IS IN THEIR 50S SO WE CAN ACTUALLY GIVE THEM A VERY PRECISE ESTIMATE OF WHAT THEIR RISK FOR PROSTATE
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50040 IT SHOULD BE THE PATIENT
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50041 IT'S THE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY IN THE END IS GOING TO BE HAVING TO CHANGE THEIR LIVES AND THEN START ADOPTING NEW
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50042 IT'S AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL CATALYST TO CHANGE
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50044 IT'S DIFFERENT FROM COMPLIANCE
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50045 IT WORKS TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY WE TALK ABOUT BEHAVIOR IN MEDICINE TODAY
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50046 AND THIS INFORMATION IS OUT THERE
trainval/bCGlWQnzDVE/50047 BUT THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF OTHER BODIES OF INFORMATION THAT ARE COMING ONLINE AND WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE CAPACITY OF THIS INFORMATION
trainval/bCjfy8Z7dv8/50001 ATTITUDE MATTERS OK
trainval/bCjfy8Z7dv8/50002 ONE MORE ANALOGY TO THE STOCK MARKET
trainval/bCjfy8Z7dv8/50003 NOW WE CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT OUR DIFFERING VALUES AND HOW WE SHOULD ADDRESS THIS BUT THE BASIC
trainval/bCjfy8Z7dv8/50004 YOU WILL EXPERIENCE DROUGHT
trainval/bClWV3eeETA/50001 I TRIED IT A FEW TIMES BECAUSE I WANTED TO FLY AS HIM
trainval/bClWV3eeETA/50002 IT NEVER QUITE WORKED ACTUALLY
trainval/bClWV3eeETA/50003 I WAS CUTTING THE LAWN AND I WAS WATERING THE FLOWERS AND STUFF AND FROM MY FIRST SALARY I BOUGHT
trainval/bClWV3eeETA/50004 I HAD THE FEELING THAT I NEEDED TO GO OUT OF MY COMFORT ZONE THAT I'D WORK FURTHER ON MY NEW COMPANY
trainval/bClWV3eeETA/50005 AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY YOU WANT TO KEEP IT
trainval/bClWV3eeETA/50006 BECAUSE THERE'S NO QUESTION WHERE I HAVE MY DOCUMENTS IF THEY ARE LYING ON MY DESK IF I HAVE THEM IN THE DRAWER
trainval/bClWV3eeETA/50007 I DID IT MYSELF
trainval/bClWV3eeETA/50008 A FEW YEARS AGO I PRINTED OUT A 750 PAGE TUTORIAL HOW TO
trainval/bClWV3eeETA/50009 I'M 100 MOBILE I HAVE NO SETTLED DOMICILE BUT MAYBE THAT'S ANOTHER TED TALK
trainval/bClWV3eeETA/50010 I'M MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN THE BIGGER SCALE
trainval/bClWV3eeETA/50011 SO TODAY IS THE DAY OF THE EXPONENTIAL CHANGE CONFERENCE AND I'M SURE WE HEAR A LOT OF REALLY INTERESTING
trainval/BcTOSxcv2So/50001 SO EVEN THEN IT WAS A PRETTY UNTIDY CONCEPT
trainval/BcTOSxcv2So/50002 BUT IT SORT OF MADE SENSE
trainval/BcTOSxcv2So/50003 WESTERN EUROPE BASICALLY FREE EASTERN EUROPE BASICALLY NOT
trainval/BcTOSxcv2So/50004 COUNTRIES WHICH ARE A BIT WEIRD A BIT DIFFERENT IT'S EASTERN EUROPE IT'S ALMOST USED AS A TERM
trainval/BcTOSxcv2So/50005 THE FOOD WAS REALLY BAD IT WAS LIKE EAST EUROPEAN
trainval/BcTOSxcv2So/50006 EASTERN EUROPE IS INTEGRATED INTO WESTERN EUROPE TO THE POINT WHERE THE CONCEPT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
trainval/BcTOSxcv2So/50007 IT'S NOT ABOUT THE EURO
trainval/BcTOSxcv2So/50009 A COUNTRY WHICH PEOPLE JUST WROTE OFF AS ANOTHER EAST EUROPEAN BASKET CASE
trainval/BcTOSxcv2So/50011 NO WORRIES ABOUT WEIRD EXTREMIST PARTIES
trainval/BcTOSxcv2So/50012 THE CREDIT RATINGS ARE GOING UP
trainval/BcTOSxcv2So/50013 AGAIN THIS IS NOT
trainval/BcTOSxcv2So/50014 HE'S VERY CORRUPT HE'S IN WITH ORGANIZED CRIME
trainval/BcTOSxcv2So/50015 ROMA IS A TERRIBLE EUROPEAN SOCIAL PROBLEM
trainval/BcTOSxcv2So/50016 AND THAT'S KIND OF TRUE
trainval/BcTOSxcv2So/50018 MAKE IT HALF A TRILLION
trainval/BcTOSxcv2So/50019 LET'S DEAL WITH THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE AS THEY ARE
trainval/BcTOSxcv2So/50020 AND IF WE MAKE CATEGORIES MAKE THEM REAL ONES WITH REAL COMMON CHARACTERISTICS
trainval/BCvzpm4d2gs/50001 HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT
trainval/BCvzpm4d2gs/50002 I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT INNOVATION
trainval/BCvzpm4d2gs/50003 THERE IS MORE MONEY AROUND
trainval/BCvzpm4d2gs/50004 JAPAN JAPAN JAPAN
trainval/BCvzpm4d2gs/50005 I CAN GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE
trainval/BCvzpm4d2gs/50006 THEY ARE PRETTY HARD NOSED BECAUSE I'M ASKING THEM TO PUT THEIR MONEY TO PUT
trainval/BCvzpm4d2gs/50007 DEMOGRAPHIC SWEET SPOT
trainval/BCvzpm4d2gs/50008 OH MY GOD THE POPULATION IS DECLINING THEREFORE IT'S TERRIBLE
trainval/BCvzpm4d2gs/50009 IT ALSO MEANS THAT OF THE YOUNG GENERATION ALMOST 1 IN 2 PEOPLE HAS NEVER HAD
trainval/BCvzpm4d2gs/50010 THIS HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT IS DRIVEN BY THE POPULATION DYNAMICS OF JAPAN
trainval/BCvzpm4d2gs/50011 THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT
trainval/BczB8oqYL0g/50001 WHEN IT COMES TO DEVELOPING ANY KIND OF IDEA IN SHAOLIN CULTURE WE START THINKING SMALL
trainval/BczB8oqYL0g/50002 MAYBE SOMETHING SMALL AGAIN THINK SMALL DON'T THINK OF A BIG THING
trainval/BczB8oqYL0g/50003 FOCUS MORE ON THE JOURNEY FOCUS MORE ON THE SMALL STEPS THAT CREATED A JOURNEY RATHER THAN JUST ON
trainval/BczB8oqYL0g/50004 THEY DID LOTS OF EXAMS FAILED PLENTY OF THEM PASSED SOME AND
trainval/BczB8oqYL0g/50005 THEY MIGHT BE WINNING IDEAS THEY MIGHT BE LOSING IDEAS I WILL KNOW AS I DEVELOP THEM
trainval/BczB8oqYL0g/50006 IN REALITY YOU'RE GETTING NOTHING FROM THE LESSON AND YOU'RE REALLY WRITING AN AWFUL EMAIL OUT I HOPE YOU'RE NOT
trainval/bczm0RsIZUM/50001 AND IT'S CAUSING US SOME PROBLEMS
trainval/bczm0RsIZUM/50002 YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART RATE ARE GOING TO BE JACKED THEY'RE GOING TO BE THROUGH THE ROOF
trainval/bczm0RsIZUM/50003 EVENTUALLY SURE YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM IS GOING TO GO OUT OF WHACK
trainval/bczm0RsIZUM/50004 I'VE READ THAT THE KIDNEYS WILL ACTUALLY MOVE 2 3 CENTIMETERS WITH A PROPER BREATH
trainval/bczm0RsIZUM/50005 RESEARCH INTO PEOPLE WITH LOW BACK PAIN JUST FOUR OR FIVE WEEKS OF EXERCISES SIMILAR TO THE ONES I'M GOING TO SHOW
trainval/bczm0RsIZUM/50006 IN A WORLD OF I'M TOO SICK
trainval/bczm0RsIZUM/50008 THAT'S THE FAST TRACK
trainval/bczm0RsIZUM/50009 EVERY MORNING WHEN YOU WAKE UP BEFORE A MEETING WE'RE GOING TO BLOCK ONE SIDE OF YOUR NOSE AND I WANT YOU TO TAKE TEN BREATHS
trainval/bczm0RsIZUM/50010 AND IT BLEW MY MIND
trainval/bczm0RsIZUM/50011 SHE SAW NO NEGATIVE OUTCOME FROM TRYING TO JUMP THAT PUDDLE
trainval/bczm0RsIZUM/50012 I'M NOT GOING TO TRY TO JUMP THAT
trainval/bczm0RsIZUM/50013 I'M TOO FAT
trainval/bczm0RsIZUM/50014 I'M TOO SICK
trainval/bczm0RsIZUM/50015 I'M TOO OLD TO TRY TO JUMP THAT PUDDLE
trainval/bDbN8R6Gb6Q/50002 IN NOVEMBER I UNDERWENT SURGERY AND SPENT A FEW WEEKS RECOVERING
trainval/bDbN8R6Gb6Q/50003 I HAD NEVER BEEN ON TV
trainval/bDbN8R6Gb6Q/50004 THEY HAVE EVERY KIND OF THERAPIST POSSIBLY IMAGINABLE
trainval/bDbN8R6Gb6Q/50005 WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY
trainval/bDbN8R6Gb6Q/50006 I REALLY LIKED THE KIDS BUT EVEN MORE I LIKED THAT MY PLANK WAS HELPING THEM
trainval/bDbN8R6Gb6Q/50007 NOW THIS DOCTOR HAD NEVER REALLY BEEN MY DOCTOR BUT HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN THERE WHEN MY
trainval/bDbN8R6Gb6Q/50008 APPARENTLY THE PLANK IS REALLY POPULAR IN CHINA
trainval/bDbN8R6Gb6Q/50009 I WAS LIKE NOTHING
trainval/bDbN8R6Gb6Q/50010 NO ONE EVER TREATED ME LIKE I WAS DIFFERENT AND MY PARENTS ALWAYS LET ME TRY WHATEVER I WANTED
trainval/bDbN8R6Gb6Q/50011 NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE
trainval/bDbN8R6Gb6Q/50012 THE WORD ITSELF SAYS I'M POSSIBLE
trainval/bDbN8R6Gb6Q/50013 AND I WAS LIKE WHY
trainval/BDOSUiEh0eY/50001 IT WAS DESIGNED FOR THREE OTHER GOALS
trainval/BDOSUiEh0eY/50002 BUT IT'S NOT FOR ALL FARMERS
trainval/BDOSUiEh0eY/50003 GROWERS COOPERATING INFORMALLY
trainval/BDOSUiEh0eY/50004 COLLABORATION ADDS CAPACITY AND IT ALSO BUILDS TRUST
trainval/BDOSUiEh0eY/50005 SO NOW THEY'RE ORDERING OUT OF A FIELD INSTEAD OF OUT OF INVENTORY IN A WAREHOUSE
trainval/BdxSZwxtg8Q/50001 I REALLY WANT TO HELP A LOT OF PEOPLE
trainval/be03wdS5Klc/50001 WHAT OTHER FACTORS AFFECT SKIN DEVELOPMENT
trainval/be03wdS5Klc/50003 I WANTED TO SEE WHAT WOULD PHYSICALLY HAPPEN TO THESE CELLS IF I WERE TO REMOVE THIS MCAT
trainval/be03wdS5Klc/50004 ON THE OTHER HAND SKIN CANCER CELLS BECAUSE THEY GROW SO RAPIDLY AND CONSUME SO MUCH ENERGY
trainval/be03wdS5Klc/50005 AS A RESULT THEY ARE PREVENTING THE ONSET OF SKIN CANCER WITHOUT AFFECTING ANY OF THE SURROUNDING TISSUE
trainval/bEdvQjTGYP8/50001 THIS IS STUFF WE TAKE FOR GRANTED TODAY
trainval/bEdvQjTGYP8/50002 SO LET ME EXPLAIN THESE THINGS
trainval/BepU74BYOtg/50001 AND OFTEN I GET ASKED QUESTIONS SO WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD
trainval/BepU74BYOtg/50002 PEOPLE WONDER DON'T YOU WANT TO SIGN WITH A MAJOR LABEL
trainval/bf7BXwVeyWw/50001 AND THAT'S A QUESTION ON WHICH WE CAN MAKE HEADWAY
trainval/bfAzi6D5FpM/50001 AND SOCIAL BUSINESS NEEDS MARKETS AND THERE ARE SOME ISSUES FOR WHICH YOU JUST CAN'T DEVELOP THE KIND OF MONEY MEASURES THAT YOU NEED FOR A
trainval/bfAzi6D5FpM/50002 BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WORKING
trainval/bfAzi6D5FpM/50003 WE'LL PUT YOU ON THE COVER OF WIRED MAGAZINE
trainval/bfAzi6D5FpM/50004 AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT HOW COULD ONE SECTOR POSSIBLY TAKE MARKET SHARE AWAY FROM ANOTHER SECTOR IF IT
trainval/bfAzi6D5FpM/50005 THIS CREATED A REAL PROBLEM FOR THESE PEOPLE
trainval/bfAzi6D5FpM/50006 THERE ARE A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THIS QUESTION
trainval/bfAzi6D5FpM/50007 WE'VE ALL BEEN TAUGHT THAT THE BAKE SALE WITH FIVE PERCENT OVERHEAD IS MORALLY SUPERIOR TO THE PROFESSIONAL FUNDRAISING
trainval/bfAzi6D5FpM/50008 WHO CARES IF THE BAKE SALE ONLY HAS FIVE PERCENT OVERHEAD IF IT'S TINY
trainval/bfAzi6D5FpM/50009 I SAID THAT CHARITABLE GIVING IS TWO PERCENT OF GDP IN THE UNITED STATES
trainval/bfAzi6D5FpM/50010 BUT ONLY ABOUT 20 PERCENT OF THAT OR 60 BILLION DOLLARS GOES TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CAUSES
trainval/BFK2knjj4lQ/50001 THERE'RE TWO TRUTHS I WANT YOU TO NOTICE ABOUT THAT
trainval/BFK2knjj4lQ/50002 I'LL SHOW YOU COMMON PATTERNS WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM THEM AND HOW TO APPLY THAT TO OUR LIFE
trainval/BFygtNQSJcU/50001 AND I D LOVE TO SHOW YOU THREE EXAMPLES OF HOW I ACTUALLY TRY TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN IN
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50001 SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO IN MY SPEECH IS REVIVE THIS ANCIENT ART OF RHETORIC AND SHARE WITH YOU SIX
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50003 YESTERDAY I WAS IN LONDON AND I WAS WATCHING ONE OF MY CLIENTS WHO IS A BIG AUSTRALIAN BUSINESSMAN
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50004 WELL THREE IS THE MAGIC NUMBER IN RHETORIC
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50005 OF COURSE HE COULD HAVE SAID THIS A WHOLE LOT QUICKER
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50006 I'M NOT ASKING 20 I'M NOT ASKING 15 I'M NOT EVEN ASKING 10
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50007 IT SWEEPS PEOPLE ONTO THE NEXT POINT WHICH IS FREE BALANCE IN STATEMENTS
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50008 BALANCED MINDS BALANCED DIETS BALANCED LIVES
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50009 METAPHOR IS PROBABLY THE MOST POWERFUL PIECE OF POLITICAL COMMUNICATION
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50010 BUT IT'S THE BIT NO ONE EVER TALKS ABOUT THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM SO TO SPEAK WHICH IS EXTRAORDINARY
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50011 I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU KNOW THIS BUT THERE IS A SECRET LANGUAGE OF LEADERSHIP A SECRET
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50012 AND THEY'RE ALL LIES AND THEY ARE NEVER CHALLENGED
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50013 WHETHER OR NOT THEY'LL INVEST IN A COMPANY WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL BACK
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50014 AND YET IT'S A BIG LIE ISN'T IT
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50015 IF YOU GOOGLE CALAIS AND CROISSANT YOU GET JUST HALF A MILLION RESULTS
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50016 AND WHAT'S THE IMAGE THIS IS PLANTING IN YOUR MIND
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50017 AND SO IT SHOULD BE OF INTENSE CONCERN TO US THAT THIS IS A PHRASE THAT IS BEING USED NOW BY THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50018 IT'S A BIG LIE
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50019 POPE FRANCIS KNOWS THAT IT'S A BIG LIE
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50020 AND SO HE DOESN'T SPEAK USING THE FINANCIAL STORM METAPHOR
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50021 HE HAS A DIFFERENT METAPHOR
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50022 BORIS JOHNSON BACK IN THE UK HE'S TALKED ABOUT HOW THE LABOR LEADER EMANATED
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50023 IN MY TIME WORKING IN GOVERNMENT WE HAD TONY BLAIR AND GORDON BROWN DESCRIBED AS TWO
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50024 THIS MANIFESTS IN OUR SPEECH
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50025 AND PEOPLE WHO ARE EMOTIONAL ABOUT SOMETHING WILL THEREFORE GO OVER THE TOP
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50026 LET'S MOVE ON TO NUMBER SIX RHYME
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50027 BUT IT'S COMPLETE NONSENSE
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50028 AND SO I'M GONG TO DEMONSTRATE THIS NOW
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50029 I'D LIKE ONE OF YOU TO THROW ME AN ISSUE
trainval/bGBamfWasNQ/50030 AMERICA'S BEEN WAITING FOR SOMEONE WHO CAN REALLY SHOW LEADERSHIP
trainval/BgbD67U0BAQ/50001 THE MAJORITY OF US ALL HAVE
trainval/BgbD67U0BAQ/50002 IS AN INDIVIDUAL CAPABLE OF CHANGE
trainval/BgbD67U0BAQ/50003 THERE ARE A LOT OF FACTORS THAT MUST BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME BUT CHANGE CAN HAPPEN
trainval/BgbD67U0BAQ/50004 AND AT THE SAME TIME I THOUGHT I WAS LOSING MY MIND BECAUSE I WAS EVEN THINKING LIKE THAT
trainval/BgbD67U0BAQ/50005 AND I HAVE A NICE PLACE TO LIVE
trainval/BgbD67U0BAQ/50006 I WOULD SAY IT WAS LIKE LOSING A LOVED ONE BECAUSE I SUFFERED TERRIBLE GRIEF AND I KEPT
trainval/BgbD67U0BAQ/50007 I REFUSED TO USE HEALTHY ALTERNATIVES TO DEAL WITH OR REDUCE MY STRESS AND I CONTINUED BURYING ALL
trainval/BgbD67U0BAQ/50008 AND WAS EXTREMELY FED UP WITH SOCIETY HOW PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS WANTING PEOPLE ALWAYS EXPECTING IN A
trainval/BgbD67U0BAQ/50009 WE NEVER REALLY KNOW WHAT'S INSIDE
trainval/BgbD67U0BAQ/50010 HOW WILL THAT MATTER
trainval/BgbD67U0BAQ/50011 WE ARE ALL JUST ONE SMALL DROP IN THIS VAST OCEAN OF HUMANITY AND ONE
trainval/BgbD67U0BAQ/50012 AND SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO STEP OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE
trainval/BgbD67U0BAQ/50013 AND AT THAT POINT IN TIME I FIGURED I HAD NO CHOICE BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO
trainval/BgbD67U0BAQ/50014 AND I GAINED INSIGHT AND I REALISED THAT THERE IS ALWAYS HOPE
trainval/BgbD67U0BAQ/50015 ALWAYS LEAD BY EXAMPLE
trainval/BgbD67U0BAQ/50016 BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN CHANGE
trainval/BgbD67U0BAQ/50017 THEY CAN TURN THEMSELVES AROUND
trainval/BgbD67U0BAQ/50018 AND YOU COULD BE THE PERSON WHO HAS THE POSITIVE EFFECT ON SOMEONE THAT MAKES THEM STOP AND THINK IT'S WORTH IT
trainval/BGcJXAXSSd0/50001 WELL EVERYBODY CAN THROW AROUND BIG NUMBERS
trainval/BGcJXAXSSd0/50004 TURNS OUT THE GENTLEMAN IN THIS PICTURE IS A GUY NAMED JOE BEERY WHO WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE THE CIO OF A COMPANY CALLED LIFE
trainval/BGcJXAXSSd0/50005 SO IT'S LIKELY I'M RELATED TO EVERY RESNICK THAT I EVER MEET BUT I DON'T KNOW
trainval/BGRy5VUSLfI/50001 AND THE WHO HAS FIGURES THAT SUGGEST ABOUT 1
trainval/BGRy5VUSLfI/50002 IT'S GETTING MORE SYSTEMATIC
trainval/BGRy5VUSLfI/50003 SO POTENTIALLY WITH THIS NEW LEVER THAT WE HAVE WITH THE NANOPATCH WE CAN HELP MAKE THAT HAPPEN
trainval/bH4zvHvregg/50001 ANOTHER GREAT ONE IS INCREASED CREATIVITY
trainval/bH4zvHvregg/50002 IT MAY SEEM LIKE 15 20 25 AND THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING
trainval/bhHJ4DRZNZM/50001 BECAUSE WITH A FEW WONDERFUL EXCEPTIONS VERY OFTEN WHEN RELIGIOUS PEOPLE COME TOGETHER RELIGIOUS
trainval/bhHJ4DRZNZM/50002 NOW WHY WAS I SO GRATEFUL TO TED
trainval/bhHJ4DRZNZM/50003 THIS IS THE SOURCE OF ALL MORALITY THIS IMAGINATIVE ACT OF EMPATHY PUTTING
trainval/bhHJ4DRZNZM/50004 AND WE NEED TO REVIVE THAT SPIRIT
trainval/bhHJ4DRZNZM/50005 IT CAN'T STOP WITH THE LAUNCH
trainval/bhHJ4DRZNZM/50006 RELIGIOUS TEACHING MUST ALWAYS LEAD TO ACTION
trainval/bhHJ4DRZNZM/50007 I WANT THEM TO GET THE MEDIA INVOLVED BECAUSE THE MEDIA ARE CRUCIAL IN HELPING TO
trainval/bhHJ4DRZNZM/50008 THE SAME APPLIES TO EDUCATORS
trainval/bhHJ4DRZNZM/50009 BECAUSE WE CAN CHANGE THE WORLD WE HAVE THE ABILITY
trainval/bhHJ4DRZNZM/50010 IT'S IN HIS BOOK THE FOUR LOVES
trainval/bhHJ4DRZNZM/50011 BUT HE WROTE ONE THING THAT STUCK IN MY MIND EVER SINCE I READ IT WHEN I WAS A SCHOOLGIRL
trainval/bHLgTUV0XWI/50001 IT WAS A WAY OF LOCATING MYSELF
trainval/bHLgTUV0XWI/50002 I WORRIED THAT IF I TOOK MY HAT OFF I WOULDN'T BE HERE ANYMORE
trainval/bHLgTUV0XWI/50003 I BEGAN TO SEE MY BODY LIKE AN IPAD OR A CAR
trainval/bHLgTUV0XWI/50004 IT HAD NO LIMITS
trainval/bHLgTUV0XWI/50005 IT WAS INVINCIBLE
trainval/bHLgTUV0XWI/50006 I WAS GREEDY
trainval/bHLgTUV0XWI/50007 I TOOK MORE THAN MY BODY HAD TO OFFER
trainval/bHLgTUV0XWI/50008 IF I WAS TIRED I DRANK MORE ESPRESSOS
trainval/bHLgTUV0XWI/50009 IF I WAS AFRAID I WENT TO MORE DANGEROUS PLACES
trainval/bHLgTUV0XWI/50010 OH SURE SURE I HAD MOMENTS OF APPRECIATION OF MY BODY THE WAY AN ABUSIVE PARENT CAN SOMETIMES HAVE A MOMENT OF
trainval/bHLgTUV0XWI/50011 I HEARD STORIES THAT GOT INSIDE MY BODY
trainval/bHLgTUV0XWI/50012 MY BODY WAS OFTEN IN THE WAY
trainval/bHLgTUV0XWI/50013 ME WAS A FLOATING HEAD
trainval/bHLgTUV0XWI/50014 AND I SAID BUT WHAT'S THE WATER PART
trainval/bHLgTUV0XWI/50015 AND SHE SANG I MEAN HER WHOLE BODY SANG
trainval/bHLgTUV0XWI/50016 AND THE OTHER WOMEN SANG AND THEY PRAYED FOR ME AND MY MOTHER
trainval/bHLgTUV0XWI/50017 IT WAS MY HEAD THAT WAS BALD AND COMFORTABLE NOW WITHOUT A HAT
trainval/bHLgTUV0XWI/50018 IT WAS THE CONTINUING DEVASTATING WAR IN THE CONGO AND THE INDIFFERENCE OF THE WORLD
trainval/bHLgTUV0XWI/50019 IT WAS THE REALIZATION THAT I HAD COME VERY CLOSE TO DYING IN THE SAME WAY THAT
trainval/bHLgTUV0XWI/50020 IT WAS A THOUSAND HALLELUJAHS AND A MILLION OMS
trainval/bHLgTUV0XWI/50021 IT WAS ALL THESE THINGS
trainval/bHLgTUV0XWI/50022 I KNOW THAT THE ABSCESS THAT GREW AROUND MY WOUND AFTER THE OPERATION THE
trainval/bib1uDXMmWs/50001 WHEN KIDS OR 21 YEAR OLD COLLEGE WOMEN ARE WATCHING COMIC BOOK MOVIES AND LOOKING FOR WHAT
trainval/bib1uDXMmWs/50002 THEY'RE NOT JUST ENTERTAINMENT
trainval/bib1uDXMmWs/50003 BUT I GO SEE SUPERHERO MOVIES FOR EXPLOSIONS AND HOT DUDES IN TIGHTS
trainval/bib1uDXMmWs/50004 THERE'S SCIENCE BEHIND THIS TOO
trainval/bib1uDXMmWs/50005 BUT IF WE SEE TONY STARK REACHING OUT TO HIS FRIENDS ASKING FOR HELP FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE OR FIGHTING FOR WHAT HE BELIEVES
trainval/bib1uDXMmWs/50006 THEY SAVE THE DAY
trainval/bib1uDXMmWs/50007 IT'S STORIES LIKE THESE I WANT TO SEE MORE OF IN THE COMICS THAT WE'RE READING AND IN THE MOVIES THAT WE'RE WATCHING
trainval/bIiXsBVTfHc/50001 AS WE KNOW FROM PSYCHOLOGY MANY PEOPLE HAVE HIDDEN UNCONSCIOUS DESIRES
trainval/bIiXsBVTfHc/50003 AS WE EVOLVE TO A MORE SEXUALLY ENLIGHTENED AND ACCEPTING SOCIETY
trainval/bIiXsBVTfHc/50004 THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE I DO BELIEVE WILL BE OPEN TO THE POSSIBILITY OF BOTH OPPOSITE
trainval/bIiXsBVTfHc/50005 PEOPLE WILL NO LONGER FEEL THE NEED TO LABEL THEMSELVES AS GAY OR STRAIGHT
trainval/bIiXsBVTfHc/50006 IN A FUTURE NON HOMOPHOBIC SOCIETY AS THE TABOOS AROUND SAME SEX
trainval/BISCnsKyOuk/50001 WHAT IS IT THAT YOU HOLD SACRED
trainval/BISCnsKyOuk/50002 END STAGE LUNG CANCER
trainval/BISrGwNSyH4/50001 BECAUSE I THINK THE THING WE FORGET IS WE TEND CRAZY BECAUSE MUSIC IS SUCH A COMMUNAL ACTIVITY BUT WE TEND
trainval/bJ8Kq1wucsk/50001 AND THAT'S A REALLY REALLY INCREDIBLE INSIGHT INTO HOW THE MIND MAKES SENSE OF
trainval/bJ8Kq1wucsk/50002 THIS IS FOR THEM
trainval/bJ8Kq1wucsk/50003 EVEN PEOPLE AT THE TOP EXPERIENCE THESE OUTCOMES
trainval/bJ8Kq1wucsk/50004 AFTER WATCHING THIS VIDEO AN HOUR LATER RICH PEOPLE BECAME JUST AS GENEROUS OF
trainval/BjclkhNAO0s/50001 I DO NOT THINK SO
trainval/BjclkhNAO0s/50002 INSIDE THE MALL ONE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S DAY OR NIGHT
trainval/BjclkhNAO0s/50003 THE HIGH INCOME PERSON GOES TO A LARGE HOME WITH ACCESS TO GARDENS WITH ACCESS TO VACATIONS
trainval/BjclkhNAO0s/50004 THEY ARE ALL ALWAYS PUBLIC HAVE PUBLIC ACCESS AND HAVE GOOD PEDESTRIAN INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT
trainval/BjclkhNAO0s/50005 BUT FOR A CITY TO GROW IN THE RIGHT PLACE IT IS NECESSARY FOR GOVERNMENTS TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE
trainval/bJkv9b9o9lo/50001 THIS HAS INTRIGUING IMPLICATIONS
trainval/bjNSaXg4S6Y/50001 WE LACK THIS MICROBIAL DIVERSITY NOWADAYS
trainval/bjNSaXg4S6Y/50002 AT THE MOMENT WORKING IN THE LATVIAN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH AND STUDY CENTRE WE HAVE MANAGED TO IDENTIFY
trainval/BJsrYqPtXFM/50001 AND MY MAGNUM OPUS WAS THIS THING CALLED THE ANDES MINT MILKSHAKE
trainval/BJsrYqPtXFM/50002 SO I WAS WALKING AROUND THE PARKING LOT I WAS CRYING I WAS SOBBING I'M NOT GOING TO LIE I'M NOT GOOD AT A LOT OF THINGS
trainval/bk65ivyQZy8/50001 I TRAVEL AROUND THE STATE LITERALLY ALMOST EVERYDAY
trainval/bk65ivyQZy8/50002 AND BY THE WAY AGAIN FOR THAT GROUP UP THERE THAT'S WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS GOING TO
trainval/bk65ivyQZy8/50003 GERMANY HAS AS MANY BILLIONAIRES PER CAPITA AS WE DO
trainval/Bk9wQD6eYts/50001 BUT YOU MAY ASK
trainval/Bk9wQD6eYts/50002 WE COULD EVEN SAY THAT IT IS A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT WHICH IS AT THE ORIGIN OF MODERN SCIENCE IN THE
trainval/bkeBjPS9ZR4/50001 IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE
trainval/bkeBjPS9ZR4/50002 WHERE DOES THE ENERGY COME FROM
trainval/bkeBjPS9ZR4/50003 YOU CAN INFLUENCE YOUR OWN TECHNOLOGIES YOU HAVE INVENTED
trainval/BKOqq21S4Nw/50001 THERE'S A REASON YOU REMEMBER THINGS
trainval/BKOqq21S4Nw/50002 AND I WAS LIKE DUH
trainval/blfVA0aSCBc/50001 THIS WAS MY FAMILY
trainval/blfVA0aSCBc/50002 I STILL STRUGGLE WITH WHAT MORE I CAN DO
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50001 NEIGHBORS CAME AND WENT
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50002 WE WANTED NATURALLY TO ASK PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEES HOW WE SHOULD OPEN UP GOVERNMENT
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50003 TURNS OUT THAT HAD NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50004 THERE WAS NO LEGAL PRECEDENT NO CULTURAL PRECEDENT NO TECHNICAL WAY OF DOING THIS
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50005 IN FACT MANY PEOPLE TOLD US IT WAS ILLEGAL
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50006 THEN IN THE 19TH CENTURY WE LAYER ON THE CONCEPT OF BUREAUCRACY AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE TO HELP US GOVERN COMPLEX
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50008 AND WE KNOW THAT THE SMARTEST PERSON ALWAYS WORKS FOR SOMEONE ELSE
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50009 WE INVEST IN BROADBAND AND SCIENCE EDUCATION AND SCIENCE GRANTS BUT WE INVEST FAR TOO LITTLE
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50010 THEY CANNOT REPLACE GOVERNMENT
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50011 FRIENDING SOMEONE ON FACEBOOK IS NOT COMPLEX ENOUGH TO DO THE HARD WORK OF YOU AND I COLLABORATING
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50012 BECAUSE IT OPENS UP ITS PLATFORM
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50013 IT OPENS UP THE API TO ALLOW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF NEW APPLICATIONS TO BE BUILT ON TOP OF IT
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50014 WE HAVE A PRECEDENT FOR THIS
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50015 NOW WHAT WE'RE SEEING LOTS OF EXAMPLES OF OBVIOUSLY IS THE OPENING UP OF GOVERNMENT DATA NOT ENOUGH EXAMPLES OF THIS
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50016 YOU CAN BARELY FILL OUT THE FORMS IN THAT AMOUNT OF TIME LET ALONE GENERATE REAL PALPABLE INNOVATIONS THAT IMPROVE
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50017 IT'S NOT ONLY THE BENEFITS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT WITH REGARD TO DEVELOPMENT
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50018 IT'S THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND THE JOB CREATION THAT'S COMING FROM THIS OPEN INNOVATION
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50019 IT'S ALSO ABOUT CREATING GOVERNMENT
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50020 THERE IS A HERO IN ALL OF US IS THEIR SLOGAN
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50021 SIMPLY THROWING DATA OVER THE TRANSOM DOESN'T CHANGE HOW GOVERNMENT WORKS
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50022 IT DOESN'T GET ANYBODY TO DO ANYTHING WITH THAT DATA TO CHANGE LIVES TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AND IT DOESN'T
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50023 RUSSIA IS USING WIKIS TO GET CITIZENS WRITING LAW TOGETHER AS IS LITHUANIA
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50024 WHEN WE START TO SEE POWER OVER THE CORE FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING LEGISLATION
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50025 OBVIOUSLY OPENING UP THE DATA IS ONE BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO CREATE LOTS MORE CREATE AND
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50026 WE'VE HEARD TALK HERE AT TED ABOUT PEOPLE BIOHACKING AND HACKING THEIR PLANTS WITH
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50027 NOT IN A PASSIVE SOCIETY A READ ONLY SOCIETY BUT IN A WRITABLE SOCIETY WHERE WE HAVE THE
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50028 THEY'RE NOT FUN ENOUGH
trainval/bLGTrz1Zolk/50029 THEY'RE NOT EXCITING ENOUGH TO GET US ENGAGED IN THIS TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY THAT AWAITS US
trainval/BltRufe5kkI/50001 THE RATE AT WHICH THE TECHNOLOGY IS GETTING FASTER IS ITSELF GETTING FASTER
trainval/BltRufe5kkI/50002 YOU SEE EVEN THOUGH ALUMINUM IS 8
trainval/BltRufe5kkI/50003 BECAUSE WE LIVE ON A WATER PLANET
trainval/BltRufe5kkI/50004 YOU CAN COUGH ON IT YOU CAN DO A FINGER BLOOD PRICK
trainval/BltRufe5kkI/50005 AND UP UNTIL NOW IT'S BEEN A SUPERCOMPUTER PROBLEM
trainval/BltRufe5kkI/50006 8 RUPEES VERSUS 17 RUPEES
trainval/BltRufe5kkI/50007 WE HAVE THE PASSION OF THE DIY INNOVATOR
trainval/BltRufe5kkI/50008 WE HAVE THE CAPITAL OF THE TECHNO PHILANTHROPIST
trainval/BltRufe5kkI/50009 AND WE HAVE THREE BILLION NEW MINDS COMING ONLINE TO WORK WITH US TO SOLVE THE GRAND CHALLENGES
trainval/BltRufe5kkI/50010 LAST MONTH MIT PUT OUT A STUDY SHOWING THAT BY THE END OF THIS DECADE IN THE SUNNY PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES
trainval/BMcduh1HEHA/50001 AND MORE THAN HALF OF THEM AREN'T EVEN AWARE OF IT
trainval/BMcduh1HEHA/50002 CAN WE CHANGE THAT
trainval/BMdMSmtTgD0/50001 AND THAT PASSION IS WATER
trainval/BMdMSmtTgD0/50002 YOU MAY ASK
trainval/BMdMSmtTgD0/50003 AND WE NEED THEM TO BE HEALTHY TO SURVIVE
trainval/BMdMSmtTgD0/50004 SO I KNEW I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING BUT I WASN'T EXACTLY SURE WHAT OR HOW
trainval/BMdMSmtTgD0/50005 AND I JUST THOUGHT
trainval/BMdMSmtTgD0/50006 AND LIKE I SAID I GREW UP IN CANADA
trainval/BMdMSmtTgD0/50007 SO I THOUGHT OK WELL HERE IS AN IDEA
trainval/BMdMSmtTgD0/50008 SO THAT'S WHAT I DID
trainval/BMdMSmtTgD0/50009 SO SOME OF YOU MAYBE TOOK THOSE IDEAS AND ACTUALLY TURNED THEM INTO REALITY RIGHT AWAY
trainval/BMdMSmtTgD0/50010 GOSH IT'S GOTTA BE A SOLUTION SO WHAT IS THAT SOLUTION
trainval/BMdMSmtTgD0/50011 OTHERS OF YOU MAYBE TOOK THOSE IDEAS AND JUST PUT THEM ON THE SHELF FOR A LITTLE WHILE
trainval/BMdMSmtTgD0/50012 AND I BECAME A MASTER OF ESCAPE
trainval/BMdMSmtTgD0/50013 IT IS NOT SUSTAINABLE
trainval/BMdMSmtTgD0/50014 I FELT LIKE AN IMPOSTOR
trainval/BMdMSmtTgD0/50015 AND I WAS ASKED TO VISUALIZE COMING ACROSS THE FINISH LINE ON A PODIUM FINISH WHICH I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT MEANT
trainval/BMdMSmtTgD0/50016 TO CREATE YOUR OWN
trainval/BMDSPhk7JSY/50001 AND 1 IN 5 WOULD BE UNHAPPY IF SOMEONE FROM THE OTHER POLITICAL PARTY MARRIED INTO OUR
trainval/BMDSPhk7JSY/50002 I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO BE TOLERANT OF EACH OTHER
trainval/BMDSPhk7JSY/50003 TOLERANCE IS FOR COWARDS
trainval/BMDSPhk7JSY/50004 THE GUYS I TALKED TO WERE NOT RACISTS BUT THEY WERE TRYING TO RECLAIM A RACIST SYMBOL
trainval/BMDSPhk7JSY/50005 PEOPLE ARE BETTER THAN YOU THINK AND THEY'LL SURPRISE YOU
trainval/BMDSPhk7JSY/50006 MAYBE YOU DON'T APPROVE OF THE SOLUTIONS THEY'VE COME UP WITH MAYBE YOU THINK YOU WOULD'VE DONE IT A DIFFERENT WAY BUT THEY THINK THEY'RE DOING THE
trainval/BMDSPhk7JSY/50007 WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT OURSELVES BECAUSE I'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT ONE THING IS THAT MOST OF US AGREE ON
trainval/bmFhWr693is/50001 THIS GUY IS STOPPING DEAD STOP DEAD STOP ON THE HIGHWAY
trainval/bmFhWr693is/50002 WHY DO WE DO THIS
trainval/bmFhWr693is/50003 I BELIEVE THAT
trainval/bmFhWr693is/50004 THAT'S REALLY HARD
trainval/bmFhWr693is/50005 WITH CARS IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE
trainval/bmFhWr693is/50007 THEY CAN HAVE A PRECISE IDEA OF WHERE THEY ARE AND SORT OF A VAGUE IDEA OF WHERE THE OTHER CARS ARE
trainval/bmFhWr693is/50008 BOTH MODELS IMPROVE
trainval/bmFhWr693is/50009 I STEP ON THE BRAKE
trainval/bmFhWr693is/50010 ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WHEN YOU GET TOO MUCH CHATTER IT'S HARD TO PROCESS ALL THE PACKETS SO YOU HAVE TO PRIORITIZE
trainval/bmmnEJ4rtCI/50002 I WASN'T LIKE WOODY ALLEN WHO ONCE SAID
trainval/BMOjVYgYaG8/50001 WE HAVE A LONGER DIGESTIVE TRACT THAN CARNIVORES
trainval/BMOjVYgYaG8/50002 WE NEED MORE SURFACE AREA WE NEED MORE MICROBES
trainval/BMOjVYgYaG8/50003 WE DO NOT HAVE CARNASSIALS WHICH ARE THE SPECIALISED TEETH THAT CARNIVORES HAVE TO SHRED MEAT
trainval/BMOjVYgYaG8/50004 WE SEE EVIDENCE OF HARVESTING OF BONE MARROW IN FAUNAL ASSEMBLES WHERE YOU SEE CHARACTERISTIC CUTTING OPEN OF THE BONES LIKE YOU
trainval/BMOjVYgYaG8/50005 AND THAT ARIDITY CAN ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT
trainval/BMOjVYgYaG8/50006 THEY CAN'T REPRODUCE IN THE WILD ANYMORE
trainval/BMOjVYgYaG8/50007 SO EVERY BANANA YOU'VE EVER EATEN IS A GENETIC CLONE OF EVERY OTHER BANANA GROWN FROM CUTTINGS
trainval/BMOjVYgYaG8/50008 THE TOMATO THAT'S SHOWN HERE LACKS THE TOMATINE AND SOLANINE TOXINS THAT ARE PRESENT IN ITS WILD
trainval/BMOjVYgYaG8/50009 THEY LAY EGGS ALMOST EVERY SINGLE DAY
trainval/BMOjVYgYaG8/50011 IT'S SUCH A STRANGE LOOKING VEGETABLE
trainval/BMOjVYgYaG8/50012 IT'S VERY INTERESTING
trainval/BMOjVYgYaG8/50013 THERE ARE SOME GENERAL OBSERVATIONS WE CAN MAKE
trainval/BMOjVYgYaG8/50014 ONE IS THAT THEY ARE REGIONALLY VARIABLE
trainval/BMOjVYgYaG8/50015 NOW UNFORTUNATELY IN AMERICAN DIETS TODAY THE TREND IS GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
trainval/BMOjVYgYaG8/50016 WE'RE LOSING ALL OF THIS BALANCE
trainval/BMOjVYgYaG8/50017 AND AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS THING GETS SO OUT OF BALANCE WE CAN EAT SO MANY MORE
trainval/BMOjVYgYaG8/50019 5 FEET OF SUGAR CANE TO REACH THAT LEVEL
trainval/BMOjVYgYaG8/50020 THAT'S AN AWFUL LOT OF SUGAR
trainval/BMOjVYgYaG8/50021 FINALLY THE PLANTS YOU'D EAT WOULD STILL CONTAIN A LOT OF TOXINS AT VARIOUS LEVELS AND PHYTOCHEMICALS SOME OF WHICH
trainval/BN9a8Ldy7Xc/50001 MEN FACE DISCRIMINATION TOO
trainval/BN9a8Ldy7Xc/50002 BOTH MEN AND WOMEN SUFFER FROM GENDER STEREOTYPES AND GENDER ROLES AND THIS IS VERY EASY TO FORGET
trainval/BN9a8Ldy7Xc/50003 LIKEWISE GENDER BASED STEREOTYPES AFFECT MEN TOO
trainval/BN9a8Ldy7Xc/50004 MANY OF MY MALES FRIENDS EXPRESS THAT THEY HAVE TO BE MASCULINE AND NOT SHOW EMOTION IN ORDER TO BE ACCEPTED
trainval/BN9a8Ldy7Xc/50005 I AM FROM NORWAY AND HERE I HAVE SEEN MY FATHER'S ROLE AS A PARENT BEING VALUED LESS BY SOCIETY
trainval/BN9a8Ldy7Xc/50006 IF WE STOP DEFINING EACH OTHER BY WHAT WE'RE NOT AND START DEFINING OURSELVES BY WHAT WE ARE WE CAN BE
trainval/BN9a8Ldy7Xc/50007 WE NEED TO THINK BEYOND HORIZONS REGARDING GENDER AND GENDER EQUALITY
trainval/BN9a8Ldy7Xc/50008 BY DEFINITION THIS IS NOT WHAT FEMINISM IS
trainval/BnC6IABJXOI/50001 NATALIE WAS 16 YEARS OLD AND IN THE 9TH GRADE AND SHE'S NOT ALONE NOT BY A LONG SHOT
trainval/BnC6IABJXOI/50002 I TEACH AT A HIGH SCHOOL WITH A STUDENT POPULATION OF NEAR 3000
trainval/BnC6IABJXOI/50003 AND THEN WHAT ABOUT THE NATALIES
trainval/BnC6IABJXOI/50004 I SPECIALIZE IN TEACHING ALGEBRA TO THE BOTTOM 25 OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND I WORK MOSTLY WITH THOSE
trainval/BnC6IABJXOI/50005 THERE I WAS WORKING WITH A STUDENT NATALIE ON SOLVING EQUATIONS
trainval/BnC6IABJXOI/50006 IT'S ALMOST LIKE A SCENE OF WASTED POTENTIAL
trainval/BnC6IABJXOI/50007 SHE HAD TO MULTIPLY 2 X 9 AND GOT STUCK
trainval/BnC6IABJXOI/50008 I FOCUS ON SYNDROME FROM THE INCREDIBLES
trainval/BnC6IABJXOI/50009 ALL SHE HAD TO DO IS COUNT BY TWOS NINE TIMES
trainval/BnC6IABJXOI/50010 THE ONLY WAY TO FEED A BUSINESS MODEL IN THIS TOXIC CULTURE OF EDUCATION IS TO
trainval/BnC6IABJXOI/50011 THAT MOMENT WHEN A STUDENT SAYS THANK YOU FOR HELPING HIM GRADUATE WITH A 2
trainval/BnC6IABJXOI/50012 NOW SHE TRIED AND FAILED FOUR DIFFERENT TIMES ON HER FINGERS ON PAPER IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH
trainval/BnC6IABJXOI/50013 WHO IS IT THAT MANUFACTURES THESE PRODUCTS
trainval/BnC6IABJXOI/50014 BUY THE NEXT TEXT BOOK
trainval/BnC6IABJXOI/50015 WE TAKE THE BLAME FOR A STUDENT WHO CAN'T STAY AWAKE IN CLASS BECAUSE SHE SPENDS HER NIGHTS ON A DIFFERENT COUCH DEPENDING ON WHICH FRIEND TAKES
trainval/BnC6IABJXOI/50016 HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THEY'RE GETTING ENOUGH SLEEP GETTING ENOUGH TO EAT SHOWING UP FOR CLASS
trainval/BnC6IABJXOI/50017 I'LL GET TO THAT IN A MINUTE
trainval/BnC6IABJXOI/50018 FIRST WORDS IN THE RESPONSE THAT'S NOT RIGOROUS
trainval/BnC6IABJXOI/50019 I'VE SEEN MY DAUGHTER'S KINDERGARTEN AND FIRST GRADE ASSIGNMENTS
trainval/BnC6IABJXOI/50020 I'VE GOT STUDENTS THAT WANT TO BE TATTOO ARTISTS MECHANICS BARBERS THEY WANT WORK
trainval/BnC6IABJXOI/50021 WHY NOT STOP JUDGING THE FISH ON HOW THEY CLIMB TREES
trainval/bNpx7gpSqbY/50001 THE CUSTOMER IS THE TRUE REALITY
trainval/bNpx7gpSqbY/50002 WE STARTED A COMPANY CALLED Z
trainval/bNpx7gpSqbY/50003 COM IT WAS AN ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY
trainval/bNpx7gpSqbY/50004 BUT BROADBAND PENETRATION WAS TOO LOW IN 1999 2000
trainval/bnvnBwP9sTo/50001 OUR MODERN FUNERARY PRACTICES ARE DESIGNED TO STAVE OFF THE NATURAL PROCESSES THAT HAPPEN TO A BODY AFTER DEATH
trainval/bnvnBwP9sTo/50002 THAT PLANET AFTER ALL SUPPORTS OUR LIVING BODIES OUR WHOLE LIVES
trainval/bnvnBwP9sTo/50003 WE WANT TO HELP INDIVIDUALS ORGANIZATIONS AND DOWN THE ROAD MUNICIPALITIES DESIGN AND BUILD
trainval/bnvnBwP9sTo/50004 WE BELIEVE THAT ACCESS TO ECOLOGICAL DEATH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT
trainval/bnvnBwP9sTo/50005 THIS PILOT PROGRAM HAS ALLOWED US TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO HARNESS THE INCREDIBLE POWER OF
trainval/bnvnBwP9sTo/50006 ONE WEEK AFTER WE BEGAN COMPOSTING OUR FIFTH DONOR BODY THE TEMPERATURE INSIDE
trainval/bo4HiVetBd0/50001 THANK YOU SO MUCH
trainval/bo4HiVetBd0/50002 FOR OTHERS IT'S NOT THE PAST IT'S NOT THE PRESENT IT'S ONLY ABOUT THE FUTURE
trainval/bo4HiVetBd0/50003 COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50001 BUT OVER THE COURSE OF THESE NINE MONTHS I GREW FRUSTRATED WITH FEELING LIKE WE WERE INTERVENING TOO FAR
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50002 BARRY ZUCKERMAN WAS DOING AS CHAIR OF PEDIATRICS AT BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50003 THE DOCTORS IT SEEMED NEVER REALLY HAD ENOUGH TIME FOR ALL THE PATIENTS TRY AS THEY MIGHT
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50004 THE REAL ISSUE IS THAT CHILD IS LIVING WITH 12 OTHER PEOPLE IN A TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50005 I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THE NEAREST FOOD PANTRY IS
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50006 AND OVER THE COURSE OF NINE MONTHS I HAD THE CHANCE TO HAVE DOZENS OF CONVERSATIONS WITH LOW INCOME
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50007 SO HEALTH LEADS WAS BORN OF THESE CONVERSATIONS A SIMPLE MODEL WHERE DOCTORS AND NURSES CAN
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50008 AND WHEN THE OFFICE OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY IN WASHINGTON D
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50009 WHICH WAS FUNDING GEIGER'S CLINIC FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS THEY WERE FURIOUS
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50010 GEIGER I KNEW I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PROUD TO BE PART OF THIS HISTORY
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50011 HERE WE ARE 45 YEARS AFTER GEIGER HAS PRESCRIBED FOOD FOR HIS PATIENTS AND I HAVE
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50012 BUT HE HASN'T PAID HIS RENT OF COURSE BECAUSE HE'S PAYING FOR HIS HIV MEDICATION AND JUST CAN'T AFFORD BOTH
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50013 SO I HAVE SPENT HOURS UPON HOURS TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF THIS WEIRD GROUNDHOG DAY
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50014 IF WE KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO HAVE A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM RATHER THAN A SICK CARE SYSTEM WHY DON'T WE
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50015 MY BELIEF IS THAT IT'S ALMOST TOO PAINFUL TO ARTICULATE OUR ASPIRATIONS FOR OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM OR
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50016 THAT IF WE ARE HONEST WITH OURSELVES AND LISTEN QUIETLY THAT WE ALL
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50017 THIS ASPIRATION THAT OUR HEALTHCARE KEEP US HEALTHY IS AN ENORMOUSLY POWERFUL ONE
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50018 WE HAD MOMS WHO WOULD COME IN DAUGHTER HAS ASTHMA WAKES UP COVERED IN COCKROACHES EVERY MORNING
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50019 IT'S JUST A SET OF CHOICES THAT PEOPLE MAKE
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50020 THESE THINGS ARE OURS
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50021 THEY WILL BE USED FOR OUR PURPOSES
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50022 THEY WILL BE USED TO REALIZE OUR ASPIRATION
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50023 SO THAT'S WHERE HEALTH LEADS BEGAN
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50024 AND ONE OF OUR LITIGATION STRATEGIES WAS ACTUALLY TO SEND ME INTO THE HOME OF THESE CLIENTS WITH THESE LARGE GLASS
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50025 AND WE CHOSE TO USE THE PRESCRIPTION FOR THAT PURPOSE
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50026 SO JUST A FEW MILES FROM HERE AT CHILDREN'S NATIONAL MEDICAL CENTER
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50027 AND WE ALWAYS WON BECAUSE THE JUDGES WERE JUST SO GROSSED OUT
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50028 WE'VE CREATED A PRESUMPTION THAT IF YOU'RE A PATIENT AT THAT HOSPITAL WITH AN ELEVATED BMI THE FOUR WALLS OF THE
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50029 YOU NEED MORE
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50030 SO ON THE ONE HAND THIS IS JUST A BASIC RECODING OF THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50031 AND ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S A RADICAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD FROM A
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50032 BUT IN MY WORLD IT'S CALLED REDUCED OBESITY AND DIABETES
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50033 SAME THING IN THE CLINIC WAITING ROOM
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50034 SO IT'S A BRUTAL WINTER IN THE NORTHEAST YOUR KID HAS ASTHMA YOUR HEAT JUST GOT TURNED OFF AND OF COURSE YOU'RE IN THE WAITING ROOM OF THE
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50035 HEALTH JUST TAKES MORE TIME
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50036 IT REQUIRES A NON CLINICAL ARMY OF COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AND CASE MANAGERS AND MANY
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50037 THE AVERAGE NCAA DIVISION I MEN'S BASKETBALL PLAYER DEDICATES 39 HOURS A WEEK TO
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50038 COLLEGE SPORTS TEAMS SAY WE'RE GOING TO TAKE DOZENS OF HOURS AT SOME FIELD ACROSS CAMPUS AT SOME
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50039 SO OUR FEELING IS IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE RUGBY TEAM IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR HEALTH AND POVERTY
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50040 AND THIS ISN'T JUST A SORT OF SHORT TERM WORKFORCE TO CONNECT PATIENTS TO BASIC RESOURCES IT'S A NEXT
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50041 AND THEY LEAVE WITH THE CONVICTION THE ABILITY AND THE EFFICACY TO REALIZE OUR MOST BASIC
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50042 DO THEY HAVE TRANSPORTATION TO THE PHARMACY
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50043 THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS I LEARNED AT HEALTH LEADS NOT IN MEDICAL SCHOOL
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50044 THE PROBLEM IS ONCE YOU GET A TASTE OF WHAT IT'S LIKE TO REALIZE YOUR ASPIRATION FOR HEALTHCARE YOU WANT
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50045 YOU MUST PURSUE THAT VISION
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50046 SO WE THOUGHT IF WE CAN GET INDIVIDUAL DOCTORS TO PRESCRIBE THESE BASIC RESOURCES FOR THEIR PATIENTS
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50047 I JUST WANTED A BLESSING I DIDN'T WANT SOME KIND OF MANDATE
trainval/BoRUrWcdkQ4/50049 I BELIEVE THAT WHEN WE MEASURE HEALTHCARE IT WILL BE NOT BY WHAT THE SYSTEM WAS BUT
trainval/boSGZ3qSAys/50001 SO HERE'S THE PROBLEM
trainval/boSGZ3qSAys/50002 IMAGINE IF YOU ADDED TO THAT NOISE CREATED BY SEISMIC SURVEYS NOISE CREATED BY DRILLING IN THE
trainval/boSGZ3qSAys/50003 SOUND AND HOW IT'S AFFECTING MARINE MAMMALS IN THE NORTH
trainval/boSGZ3qSAys/50004 TRY TO IMAGINE THAT YOU'RE DRIVING YOUR CAR OR RIDING YOU BIKE TO WORK
trainval/boSGZ3qSAys/50005 PRETTY HARD TO FOCUS RIGHT
trainval/boSGZ3qSAys/50006 MAYBE YOU HEAR A PROPELLER NOISE YOU LOOK UP THINKING IT'S GOING TO BE RIGHT ABOVE YOU BECAUSE IT SOUNDS SO CLOSE AND IT IS
trainval/boSGZ3qSAys/50007 AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY THE NOISE THAT IS CREATED BY THESE SURVEYS IS ACTUALLY OPERATING AT A
trainval/boSGZ3qSAys/50008 WHAT IF THEIR FOOD MOVES AS WELL
trainval/boSGZ3qSAys/50009 WHAT WAS DIFFERENT THAN BEFORE
trainval/Bp2FvktSTRM/50001 IT ALLOWS US TO TALK TO MORE PEOPLE
trainval/Bp2FvktSTRM/50002 IT ALSO HAS BEEN LINKED TO SEVERAL COGNITIVE AND SOCIAL ADVANTAGES AND IT DELAYS THE ONSET OF
trainval/Bp2FvktSTRM/50003 WHAT I'LL TELL YOU TODAY IS THAT THE HUMAN BRAIN IS FULLY CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING NATIVE
trainval/Bp2FvktSTRM/50004 WE ARE IN EUROPE AFTER ALL
trainval/Bp2FvktSTRM/50005 I'M A RESEARCHER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON'S INSTITUTE FOR LEARNING AMP BRAIN SCIENCES I LABS FOR
trainval/Bp2FvktSTRM/50006 WHAT GOES ON IN THE BRAINS OF THOSE BABIES WHO GROW UP IN HOUSEHOLDS WHERE TWO LANGUAGES ARE SPOKEN
trainval/Bp2FvktSTRM/50007 THAT IT MAKES IT SLOWER
trainval/Bp2FvktSTRM/50008 RESEARCH DOESN'T ACTUALLY SUPPORT THIS
trainval/Bp2FvktSTRM/50009 INSTEAD WHAT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN IS THAT IF WE CONSIDER THE PATTERNS IN BILINGUAL LEARNING THEY'RE ACTUALLY VERY VERY
trainval/Bp2FvktSTRM/50010 I DON'T THINK IT DOES
trainval/bpi6us7wQfE/50001 I HAD A SLEEPING BAG
trainval/bpi6us7wQfE/50002 CAN I GET HER TO A HOSPITAL
trainval/bpi6us7wQfE/50003 I WANT TO GO BACK AND TALK TO HER
trainval/bpi6us7wQfE/50004 BUT I WAS OFF ON ASSIGNMENT
trainval/bpi6us7wQfE/50005 AND THE HOUSE THAT I HAD SPENT TIME IN WAS EMPTY
trainval/bpi6us7wQfE/50006 AND HER EYES WERE BLOODSHOT AND SHE SEEMED TO BE IN SHOCK
trainval/bpi6us7wQfE/50007 I WAS VERY WORRIED ABOUT HER
trainval/bpi6us7wQfE/50008 WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME AND HAVE LUNCH TOMORROW
trainval/bpi6us7wQfE/50012 WE'RE GOING TO DIE FROM THE SMOKE
trainval/bpi6us7wQfE/50015 PEOPLE WERE LYING ON THE FLOOR
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50001 I THINK THIS IS GOING TO WORK
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50002 MY WIFE AND I WERE APART FROM EACH OTHER WHEN WE WERE ENGAGED FOR SIX MONTHS
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50003 THIS ONE MY FRIENDS IS A GAME CHANGER BECAUSE IF IT'S THE MILLENNIALS THEY'RE ARE A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50004 IF IT'S A LIFE STAGE IT'S A CHANGE THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND AND ADAPT TO
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50005 AND UNDERSTANDING THAT MAKES WORKING TOGETHER EASIER AND IT MAKES BEING A FATHER EASIER
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50006 THEY SAY 28 27
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50007 WE ALL SEE IT WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE A NAME FOR IT
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50008 PARENTS SAY THIS WHEN I WAS 25 I HAD A MORTGAGE AND A KID
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50009 BOSSES ARE HOW DO WE MOTIVATE THEM
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50010 THEY'RE NOT ENGAGED
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50011 HOW DO WE KEEP THEM FROM LEAVING
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50012 SIMPLE THE RESEARCH IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50013 ALL START UPS ARE RISKY BUT THIS WAS TWICE AS RISKY AS THE AVERAGE START UP
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50014 HIS MOTHER SAID NO YOU HAVE 500 DOLLARS TO YOUR NAME AND A NEW BRIDE
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50015 HE SAID MY NEW BRIDE CAN WORK
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50016 SHE CAN GET INTO ANY GRAD SCHOOL WITH HER GRADES
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50017 WE'RE FINE AND WE BOTH WANT TO LIVE IN RHODE ISLAND
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50018 SO THEY MOVED TO RHODE ISLAND WHICH HAS GREAT LOBSTER ROLLS I HAVE TO TELL YOU AFTER LIVING IN CHICAGO
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50019 HALF OF WHAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT MILLENNIALS IS WRONG
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50020 SO THEY LIVE OUT THERE
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50021 THEY'RE QUITE HAPPY
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50022 THEY'RE DIRT POOR
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50023 THEY HAVE HAND ME DOWN FURNITURE IN THE BACK OF A U HAUL AND HE JUST RESIGNED LAST WEDNESDAY
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50024 HE RAN OUT OF MONEY
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50025 WE COULD PUT IT ON THE CREDIT CARD AND YOU'LL LET US MOVE BACK IN WITH YOU WON'T YOU
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50026 HALF OF THE FRUSTRATIONS MILLENNIALS HAVE ABOUT COMMUNICATING WITH THE OLDER GENERATIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50027 HE WAS GOING TO GET A BUSINESS JOB LAST YEAR
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50028 WHEN HE GRADUATES HIS MOTHER SAYS GO DO THIS RESIDENCY
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50029 IT'S VERY SELECTIVE
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50030 I THINK LABORERS ARE AMAZINGLY VALUABLE AND HONORABLE WORK
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50031 MIKE ROWE AND THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN TO GIVE HONOR TO PEOPLE WHO ARE LABORERS IN DIRTY JOBS
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50032 YOU GRADUATE WITH A BUSINESS DEGREE YOU MAKE 45000 DOLLARS AS A SALESMAN
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50033 YOU GRADUATE WITH AN APPRENTICESHIP AND ARE ABLE TO READ A BLUEPRINT AND YOU'RE A WELDER YOU START AT
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50034 CHANGE PEOPLE THEY DATE
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50035 CHANGE PLACES THEY LIVE
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50036 I FOUND SOMEBODY IN SEATTLE ON MATCH
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50037 BECAUSE A PLANE FLIGHT WAS 200 DOLLARS AND LONG DISTANCE WAS 2 DOLLARS A MINUTE
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50038 MAX YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE THERE FOREVER
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50039 IT'S YOUR FIRST JOB
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50040 WE DIDN'T FACETIME WE WROTE EACH OTHER LETTERS FOR SIX MONTHS WHILE WE WERE ENGAGED
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50041 IT'S A NEW LIFE STAGE
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50042 I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'RE NOT ENGAGED
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50043 BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT 28 WITH A MORTGAGE AND A BABY
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50044 THEY'RE FACETIMING I THINK THIS IS MY SOUL MATE
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50045 I'M GOING TO GO MAKE THIS WORK
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50046 THE BOSS IS GOING YOU'RE MY BEST MILLENNIAL
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50047 YOU CAN'T LEAVE
trainval/BPMrcY9z0nM/50049 DUDE COME BACK
trainval/bq39x2HWjNk/50001 BUT IT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
trainval/bq39x2HWjNk/50002 I DIDN'T KNOW IF I WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL CASE OR NOT I REALLY DIDN'T CARE ALL I KNOW IS THAT I HAD REALLY BIG DREAMS
trainval/bq39x2HWjNk/50003 I WASN'T READY TO CARRY THE BURDEN OF A LIFE LONG DRUG ADDICT LABEL
trainval/bq39x2HWjNk/50004 THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS LABEL IS IT IS A LIFE LONG THING
trainval/bq39x2HWjNk/50005 WHAT IS NATURAL RECOVERY
trainval/BQj2ZSGPsY8/50001 AND TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO BUILD A BIGGER HIGHER ENERGY COLLIDER AND THE BIGGEST HIGHEST ENERGY COLLIDER IN THE WORLD
trainval/BQj2ZSGPsY8/50002 MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAD BEEN WORKING THEIR ENTIRE CAREERS FOR THIS MOMENT AND FRANKLY TO LITTLE CURIOUS ME
trainval/BQj2ZSGPsY8/50003 SO 2015 WAS GO TIME
trainval/BQj2ZSGPsY8/50004 AS A KID I WOULD PUZZLE OVER QUESTIONS JUST LIKE THIS
trainval/BQj2ZSGPsY8/50005 I WOULD FIDDLE AROUND WITH MICROSCOPES AND ELECTROMAGNETS AND I WOULD READ ABOUT THE FORCES OF THE SMALL AND ABOUT QUANTUM
trainval/BQj2ZSGPsY8/50006 THEY HAVE DIFFERENT RULES
trainval/BQj2ZSGPsY8/50007 BUT ONE OF THESE OPTIONS IS HUGE AND IT HAS TO DO WITH THAT LONG STANDING QUESTION THAT
trainval/BQj2ZSGPsY8/50008 BUT MATH IS MATH AND WE CAN PLAY AROUND WITH OUR MATH HOWEVER WE WANT
trainval/BQj2ZSGPsY8/50009 AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PLAYING AROUND WITH EXTRA DIMENSIONS OF SPACE FOR A VERY LONG TIME BUT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN AN ABSTRACT MATHEMATICAL
trainval/BQj2ZSGPsY8/50010 I SEE THE LOOKS ON YOUR FACES
trainval/BQj2ZSGPsY8/50011 THAT'S THE STAGE WE'RE AT NOW
trainval/BQj2ZSGPsY8/50012 BUT THEN WHAT DO WE DO
trainval/BQj2ZSGPsY8/50013 DO WE JUST GIVE UP AND FLY AWAY
trainval/BQj2ZSGPsY8/50014 ABSOLUTELY NOT WE WOULD BE TERRIBLE SCIENTISTS IF WE DID
trainval/BQj2ZSGPsY8/50015 WE DON'T DECIDE WHERE NATURE PLACES NEW PARTICLES
trainval/BQj2ZSGPsY8/50016 WE ONLY DECIDE TO KEEP EXPLORING
trainval/BQj2ZSGPsY8/50017 WE ALREADY USE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES IN PARTS OF THE LHC BUT IMAGINE DESIGNING A PARTICLE
trainval/BQj2ZSGPsY8/50018 BUT WHAT IF
trainval/BQj2ZSGPsY8/50019 WHAT IF THE ULTIMATE QUESTION WHAT IF EVEN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CAN'T HELP US ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS
trainval/BQj2ZSGPsY8/50020 AND WE'LL NEED TO ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE TO JOIN US IN STUDYING SCIENCE SINCE WE NEED FRESH EYES ON THESE CENTURY OLD
trainval/BQnOTJH3w4s/50001 SOMETHING WAS NOT RIGHT BECAUSE I WASN'T PREACHING BECAUSE I WANTED TO CHANGE LIFE
trainval/BQnOTJH3w4s/50002 AND I REMEMBER THAT DAY
trainval/BQnOTJH3w4s/50003 WE WERE ABLE TO GET GAY MEN DRUG USERS SEX WORKERS IN THE AGENDA
trainval/BQnOTJH3w4s/50004 JOIN ME IN TELLING INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE UN LIKE THE WORLD BANK LIKE THE WHO THAT
trainval/BQOz6OVz1zc/50001 IS THIS WHAT WE SAID TO EACH OTHER
trainval/BQOz6OVz1zc/50002 IT IS AMAZINGLY SUCCESSFUL BUT IT CANNOT BE THE COMPLETE PICTURE OF NATURE AT ITS FUNDAMENTAL SCALES
trainval/BQOz6OVz1zc/50003 IT ABSOLUTELY HAS TO HAPPEN THIS IS BEING PLANNED
trainval/BQOz6OVz1zc/50004 WE DON'T KNOW
trainval/BQOz6OVz1zc/50005 ONE WAY IS IF THE PARTICLES ARE SUPER MASSIVE
trainval/BQOz6OVz1zc/50007 IT'S DARK BECAUSE IT INTERACTS SO SLIGHTLY WITH OUR EVERYDAY ELECTROMAGNETIC WORLD THAT IT'S EFFECTIVELY BEEN HIDDEN FROM ALL
trainval/BQOz6OVz1zc/50008 POSSIBLY PROBABLY NOT
trainval/BQOz6OVz1zc/50009 I'VE NO IDEA WHAT THE DISCOVERY OF A DARK PHOTON WILL MEAN BEYOND EXPANDING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNIVERSE
trainval/BqSxYSOZrgU/50001 I HAD BOTH A MAN AND A WOMAN ASK ME FOR A RAISE AT THE SAME TIME SO I WAS CONFRONTED WITH MY DIFFERENT REACTIONS
trainval/BqSxYSOZrgU/50002 BUT I'VE REALIZED WE DON'T NEED TO
trainval/BqSxYSOZrgU/50003 IT COULD VERY WELL BE
trainval/Bqx8abrSIYo/50001 AND THEN I SAID TO HER MOM YOU'VE BEEN A GOOD MOM TO ME AND MY BROTHER YOU'VE LOVED US YOU'VE LOVED
trainval/Bqx8abrSIYo/50002 AND THIS HAPPENED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
trainval/Bqx8abrSIYo/50003 AND THEN IF WE BALANCE OURSELVES IN THESE TWO DIMENSIONS WE'LL CREATE THE OPTIMUM ENVIRONMENT FOR OURSELVES AND EACH
trainval/Br1AIvMrvAE/50001 INDEED ONE WONDERS THAT WITHOUT A DUTY OF CARE HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE HAD TO SUFFER FROM GASTROENTERITIS BEFORE STEVENSON
trainval/Br1AIvMrvAE/50002 TABLOID NEWSPAPERS DO NOT APPEAR TO ADVANCE THE POLITICAL CITIZENSHIP OF THEIR READERS RELATIVE EVEN TO
trainval/Br1AIvMrvAE/50003 THEY'RE NOT JUST LESS POLITICALLY ENGAGED
trainval/Br1AIvMrvAE/50004 THROUGHOUT THAT CAREER I NEVER ACCEPTED THAT A FILMMAKER SHOULD SET ABOUT PUTTING THEIR OWN WORK OUTSIDE OR ABOVE WHAT
trainval/Br1AIvMrvAE/50005 STEVENSON GLEN LANE PAISLEY
trainval/Br1AIvMrvAE/50006 AND AS A CONSEQUENCE ACROSS THE WESTERN WORLD THE OVER SIMPLISTIC POLICIES OF THE PARTIES OF PROTEST AND THEIR APPEAL
trainval/Br1AIvMrvAE/50007 THE CASE OF DONOGHUE VS
trainval/Br1AIvMrvAE/50008 IF WE WANT TO PROVIDE DECENT FULFILLING LIVES FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN WE NEED TO EXERCISE TO THE VERY GREATEST
trainval/bRCo1Wxksfg/50001 OF LYING IMMENSIVELY TO YOUR FRIENDS TO YOUR FAMILY AND IN MANY CASES TO YOURSELF JUST
trainval/bRCo1Wxksfg/50002 BUT TODAY'S GENERATION WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY BE HONEST ABOUT WHO WE ARE
trainval/bRCo1Wxksfg/50003 THAT WAS WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO DO
trainval/BRETz2FSheQ/50001 AND I SPENT ABOUT THREE YEARS RESEARCHING
trainval/bRQahFJUSJQ/50001 AND NONE OF THAT WAS EXPECTED OF ME
trainval/bRQahFJUSJQ/50002 I JUST TRAVELED FROM A TO B AND I CAME THERE WITHOUT A PASSPORT
trainval/bRQahFJUSJQ/50003 AND INTERFERE WITH OUR GOD GIVEN RIGHT TO MOVE AROUND AS FREE HUMAN BEINGS
trainval/bRuU02haIK8/50001 THIS IS MY CONCERN
trainval/bRuU02haIK8/50002 THE PEOPLE AROUND US MISS OUT ON SO MUCH AS WELL
trainval/bRuU02haIK8/50003 THEY MISS OUT ON THAT UNIQUE GIFT THAT ONLY WE CAN BRING TO THEM
trainval/bRuU02haIK8/50004 SO HOW DO WE CHANGE OURSELVES
trainval/bRuU02haIK8/50005 IF THAT'S MY CONCERN HERE'S MY HOPE
trainval/bRuU02haIK8/50006 THAT WAS HOW THE WORLD HAD TREATED HER AND THAT WAS HOW SHE HAD COME TO FEEL
trainval/bRuU02haIK8/50007 AND CRIME LED TO PRISON AND PRISON LED TO THE CHAIR IN THE CORNER OF MY OFFICE
trainval/bRuU02haIK8/50008 SHE TALKED ABOUT FONDNESS FOR THOSE THINGS
trainval/bRuU02haIK8/50009 BUT I CAN DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS
trainval/bRuU02haIK8/50010 THEN SHE FOUND SELF LOVE
trainval/bRuU02haIK8/50011 AND SHE TALKED AND TALKED MAYBE I WOULD JUST USE ON WEDNESDAYS
trainval/bRuU02haIK8/50012 IT'S THAT SELF ESTEEM THAT ENABLES US TO BE OURSELVES TO CONFIDENTLY BE
trainval/bRuU02haIK8/50013 THINK OF THE BIG THINGS AND THINK OF THE SMALL ONES
trainval/bRuU02haIK8/50014 YOU MIGHT LITERALLY HAVE SAID THAT
trainval/bRuU02haIK8/50015 THAT IS SELF LOVE
trainval/bRuU02haIK8/50016 IT'S NOT BEING SELF ABSORBED
trainval/bRuU02haIK8/50017 IT'S NOT BEING EGOCENTRIC
trainval/bRuU02haIK8/50018 IT'S JUST BEING REALISTIC
trainval/bRuU02haIK8/50019 IT'S JUST SAYING THERE ARE THINGS I DO THAT GO WELL
trainval/bRuU02haIK8/50020 AND WE'RE ABLE TO SAY THAT'S GOOD
trainval/bRuU02haIK8/50021 IT IS NOT PERFECT BUT IT IS GOOD
trainval/bS7A7S8AZSQ/50001 THIS TAUGHT ME THE LESSON OF BEING COMMITTED TO THE TASK AT HAND KEEPING THE MIND HERE AND NOW
trainval/bS7A7S8AZSQ/50002 EVEN THOUGH WE ONLY SEE THIS BRIEFLY IN THE FILMS WE SEE THAT IS THE REASON FOR HIS FALL TO THE DARK SIDE
trainval/bS7A7S8AZSQ/50003 IT IS ATTACHMENT AND LOVE THAT BROUGHT ABOUT HIS DOWNFALL
trainval/bS7A7S8AZSQ/50004 GEORGE LUCAS HAS SAID ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS THAT STAR WARS DRAWS A LOT OF ITS TEACHINGS FROM EASTERN
trainval/bS7A7S8AZSQ/50005 IT'S REALLY UP TO YOU
trainval/bscKRPkR328/50001 WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING WHAT WE'RE BASICALLY SEEING ARE REPEAT RUNAWAYS AND PRIOR VICTIMS OF
trainval/bscKRPkR328/50002 GO TO A TRUCK STOP LATE AT NIGHT OR A BUSY TRUCK STOP SIT DOWN IN A PARKING LOT STARE OUT AND WATCH THE PARKING
trainval/bscKRPkR328/50003 OR GO TO THE NAIL SALON
trainval/bscKRPkR328/50004 WHY ARE THEY SCARED
trainval/bscKRPkR328/50005 WE'VE DOCUMENTED CASES IN OVER 160 COUNTRIES ALL 50 US STATES OVER
trainval/bscKRPkR328/50006 I MEAN AT FIRST YOU THINK THESE PEOPLE ARE BAD THAT'S WHY THIS IS HAPPENING
trainval/bscKRPkR328/50008 THEY CAN ONLY BE PRODUCED BY SLAVED LABOUR
trainval/bscKRPkR328/50009 I DID THAT FOR YEARS
trainval/BsFxokC02sg/50001 IS THIS A KID THAT CAN SIT FOR A NEBULIZER TREATMENT
trainval/bSidnKdH5S4/50001 AND WHEN IT OCCURRED I WAS THE ONLY DOCTOR ON THE MOUNTAIN
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50001 NOW THIS IS WHEN SOMETHING REALLY BIZARRE HAPPENS
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50002 SO WE ALL KNOW WHAT TO DO IN THIS SITUATION RIGHT
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50003 BUT THE COOL THING ABOUT RUNNING AS I'VE DISCOVERED IS THAT SOMETHING BIZARRE HAPPENS IN THIS ACTIVITY ALL THE TIME
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50004 WINS THE NEW YORK CITY MARATHON GOES HOME WITH A BIG FAT CHECK
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50005 YOU SHOW ME A CREATURE WITH WEBBED FEET AND GILLS SOMEHOW WATER'S INVOLVED
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50006 SOMEONE WITH THAT KIND OF HEART THERE'S SOME KIND OF CONNECTION THERE
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50007 NUMBER ONE IS THEY HAVE BEEN LIVING ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED FOR THE PAST 400 YEARS
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50008 THE MAYANS AND AZTECS ENGAGED WHICH IS WHY THERE ARE VERY FEW MAYANS AND AZTECS
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50009 THE TARAHUMARA HAD A DIFFERENT STRATEGY
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50010 THEY TOOK OFF AND HID IN THIS LABYRINTHINE NETWORKING SPIDER WEBBING
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50011 THE SECOND THING REMARKABLE ABOUT THE TARAHUMARA IS DEEP INTO OLD AGE 70 TO 80 YEARS OLD
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50012 THEY ARE FREE FROM ALL OF THESE MODERN AILMENTS
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50013 AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUTLIERS THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME KIND OF CAUSE AND EFFECT
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50014 WELL THERE ARE TEAMS OF SCIENTISTS AT HARVARD AND THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH THAT ARE BENDING THEIR BRAINS AND TRYING TO FIGURE
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50015 THEY'RE TRYING TO SOLVE THOSE SAME KINDS OF MYSTERIES
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50016 AND ONCE AGAIN A MYSTERY WRAPPED INSIDE OF A MYSTERY PERHAPS THE KEY TO DERARTU TULU AND THE
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50017 AUSTRALOPITHECUS HAD A TINY LITTLE PEA BRAIN
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50019 TO HAVE A BRAIN OF THAT SIZE YOU NEED TO HAVE A SOURCE OF CONDENSED CALORIC ENERGY
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50020 SHE'S 37 YEARS OLD
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50021 IN OTHER WORDS EARLY HUMANS ARE EATING DEAD ANIMALS NO ARGUMENT THAT'S A FACT
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50022 EVERY OTHER ANIMAL IS STRONGER THAN WE ARE THEY HAVE FANGS THEY HAVE CLAWS THEY HAVE NIMBLENESS THEY HAVE
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50023 WE THINK USAIN BOLT IS FAST
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50026 THE FASTEST WOMAN TO EVER RUN A MILE DID IT IN 415
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50027 FOR SOME REASON YOU GUYS ARE JUST REALLY SLOW
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50028 WHY YOU WERE BANNED FROM THE MARATHON BEFORE THE 1980S
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50030 YOU TAKE A RUNNER LIKE ANN TRASON OR NIKKI KIMBALL OR JENN SHELTON PUT THEM IN A RACE OF 50 OR 100 MILES
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50031 I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50032 A COUPLE YEARS AGO EMILY BAER SIGNED UP FOR A RACE CALLED THE HARDROCK 100 WHICH TELLS YOU ALL YOU NEED TO
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50033 THEY GIVE YOU 48 HOURS TO FINISH THIS RACE
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50034 THANKS VERY MUCH
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50035 IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHY THE TARAHUMARA DON'T FIGHT AND DON'T DIE OF HEART DISEASE WHY A POOR ETHIOPIAN
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50036 MAYBE WE EVOLVED AS A HUNTING PACK ANIMAL
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50037 WE'RE REALLY GOOD AT BEING SWEATY AND SMELLY
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50038 AND THEN AFTER THAT YOU SUCCUMB TO THE RIGORS OF TIME
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50039 BUT IT AIN'T DOING BOTH
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50040 SO WHAT IF WE EVOLVED AS HUNTING PACK ANIMALS
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50041 WHAT IF THE ONLY NATURAL ADVANTAGE WE HAD IN THE WORLD WAS THE FACT THAT WE COULD GET TOGETHER AS A GROUP
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50042 WELL IF THAT'S TRUE A COUPLE OTHER THINGS HAD TO BE TRUE AS WELL
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50043 IF YOU GO OUT BY YOURSELF AND TRY TO CHASE AN ANTELOPE I GUARANTEE THERE WILL BE TWO CADAVERS OUT IN THE SAVANNA
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50044 AND YOU'LL GET SLOWER AND SLOWER UNTIL EVENTUALLY YOU'RE BACK TO RUNNING THE SAME SPEED YOU WERE AT AGE 19
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50045 YOU NEED TO HAVE THOSE 64 AND 65 YEAR OLDS WHO HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME TO UNDERSTAND WHICH ANTELOPE YOU'RE TRYING TO
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50047 THOSE EXPERT TRACKERS HAVE TO BE PART OF THE PACK
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50048 THEY CAN'T BE 10 MILES BEHIND
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50049 THE PACK STAYS TOGETHER
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50050 YOU CAN'T BE A PISSED OFF PACK
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50052 HE PISSED ME OFF
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50054 YOU KNOW WE LOOK AT RUNNING AS THIS KIND OF ALIEN FOREIGN THING THIS PUNISHMENT YOU'VE GOT TO DO BECAUSE YOU ATE PIZZA THE NIGHT BEFORE
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50055 BUT MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50056 WELL HOW DO WE SPOIL ANYTHING
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50057 WE TRY TO CASH IN ON IT
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50058 WE TRY TO CAN IT AND PACKAGE IT AND MAKE IT BETTER AND THEN SELL IT TO PEOPLE
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50059 WE TALKED FOR TWO MINUTES BACKSTAGE AND SHE TALKED ABOUT PLANTAR FASCIITIS
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50060 SO IF HUMANS EVOLVED AS RUNNERS IF THAT'S OUR ONE NATURAL ADVANTAGE THEN WHY ARE WE SO BAD AT IT
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50061 IT'S ONLY IN OUR LIFETIME THAT RUNNING HAS BECOME ASSOCIATED WITH FEAR AND PAIN
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50062 GERONIMO USED TO SAY MY ONLY FRIENDS ARE MY LEGS
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50063 THAT'S BECAUSE AN APACHE TRIATHLON USED TO BE YOU'D RUN 50 MILES ACROSS THE DESERT ENGAGE IN HAND TO HAND COMBAT
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50064 WE ARE HERE TODAY
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50065 WE HAVE OUR DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50066 ALL OF OUR SCIENCE COMES FROM THE FACT THAT OUR ANCESTORS WERE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY EVERY DAY WHICH WAS
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50067 SO HOW DO WE GET BACK TO THAT AGAIN
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50068 WELL I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THE FIRST THING IS GET RID OF ALL PACKAGING ALL THE SALES ALL THE MARKETING
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50069 GET RID OF ALL THE STINKING RUNNING SHOES
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50070 STOP FOCUSING ON URBAN MARATHONS WHICH IF YOU DO FOUR HOURS YOU SUCK AND IF YOU DO
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50071 SO WHAT'S THE BENEFIT
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50072 SO YOU BURN OFF THE H AGEN DAZS FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50073 BUT MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER BENEFIT THERE AS WELL
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50074 MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING BETWEEN WHAT WE ARE TODAY AND WHAT THE TARAHUMARA HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50075 SO YOU HAVE THESE THREE MYSTERIES
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50076 AND IF WE FIND THAT THING MAYBE THERE IS A BIG FAT NOBEL PRIZE OUT THERE
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50077 WHAT I'VE BEEN SEEING TODAY IS THERE IS A GROWING SUBCULTURE OF BAREFOOT RUNNERS PEOPLE WHO'VE GOTTEN RID
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50078 AND WHAT THEY HAVE FOUND UNIFORMLY IS YOU GET RID OF THE SHOES YOU GET RID OF THE STRESS YOU GET RID OF THE
trainval/bSiGZPtWXzE/50079 AND WHAT YOU FIND IS SOMETHING THE TARAHUMARA HAVE KNOWN FOR A VERY LONG TIME THAT THIS CAN BE A WHOLE LOT OF FUN
trainval/BSiNIZ6zZqY/50001 AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY
trainval/BSiNIZ6zZqY/50002 AND IN MY VIEW THE TELLING OF A STORY ISN'T REALLY WHAT MATTERS
trainval/BSiNIZ6zZqY/50003 WELL IT'S BEEN IMPORTANT IN MY LIFE
trainval/BSiNIZ6zZqY/50004 BUT I'LL TRY MY BEST
trainval/BSiNIZ6zZqY/50005 BECAUSE IT DOES
trainval/BSiNIZ6zZqY/50006 I WASN'T THINKING ABOUT HOW OTHERS WOULD REACT TO MY WORK
trainval/BSiNIZ6zZqY/50007 IT'S CALLED UNTITLED
trainval/BStjKYvEziI/50001 YOU MIGHT THINK THIS IS NOT MUCH COMPARED TO THE BILLIONS OF NEURONS WE HAVE
trainval/BStjKYvEziI/50003 AND THEN FINALLY LET ME POINT OUT THE LAST ONE A QUIRKY ONE
trainval/BStjKYvEziI/50004 SO JAPANESE GROUPS ARE FASCINATED WITH FOOD TEXTURES AND THEY HAVE SHOWN THAT ACTUALLY
trainval/BSxI3YxAPW4/50001 PLAY VIDEO GAMES
trainval/BSxI3YxAPW4/50002 THIS IS COMPLETELY HYPOTHETICAL
trainval/BSxI3YxAPW4/50003 PIERRE VILLEY WAS A FRENCH WRITER BLIND HIMSELF AND HE SAID
trainval/BSxI3YxAPW4/50004 THERE'S NOTHING THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT THIS WAS DONE BY A BLIND PERSON
trainval/BSxI3YxAPW4/50005 SO WE ASKED ESREF TO LIE IN THE SCANNER AND MAKE A SERIES OF DRAWINGS FOR US
trainval/BSxI3YxAPW4/50006 IN FACT I ASKED ESRAF
trainval/BSxI3YxAPW4/50007 YOU USE THE INFORMATION YOU GATHER FROM YOUR SIGHT TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS GATHER INFORMATION IDENTIFY LANDMARKS
trainval/BSxI3YxAPW4/50008 HE'S ALSO FEELING VIBRATIONS IN HIS CANE WHEN TAPPING ON THE STREET TO FOLLOW THE SIDEWALK
trainval/BSxI3YxAPW4/50009 SO WITH THIS CHALLENGE IN MINDS WE WANTED TO COME UP WITH NEW TOOLS NEW APPROACHES TO HELP BLIND PEOPLE
trainval/BSxI3YxAPW4/50010 VIDEO GAMES TODAY ARE IMMENSELY POPULAR
trainval/BSxI3YxAPW4/50011 IF THESE MONSTERS CATCH YOU THEY TAKE THE JEWEL AND HIDE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE MAZE
trainval/BSxI3YxAPW4/50012 NOW CAN YOU FIND YOUR WAY AROUND
trainval/BSxI3YxAPW4/50013 IT TURNS OUT THEY CAN AND THEY DO IT QUITE WELL
trainval/BSxI3YxAPW4/50014 I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU HAVE TO PLAY A GAME EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO GO SOMEWHERE BUT THE PREPS THE IDEA OF USING THE SOUNDS OR
trainval/BSxI3YxAPW4/50015 I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH ONE LAST PIECE OF INFORMATION TO THIS PUZZLE
trainval/BSxI3YxAPW4/50016 SO JUST LIKE ESREF OUR BLIND PAINTER WHO WAS USING HIS VISUAL BRAIN TO PAINT OUR GAMERS ARE USING THEIR
trainval/BSxI3YxAPW4/50017 THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING TO KEEP IN MIND BECAUSE REMEMBER
trainval/BSxI3YxAPW4/50018 BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT IF WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THE RIGHT TOOLS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE OUR MENTALITY AND
trainval/bSZh8qdKaBc/50001 SECOND AND THIRD ORDERLY EFFECTS WHICH WILL LEAD TO MORE HUMAN ELABORATE COLLABORATION
trainval/bSZh8qdKaBc/50002 WE ALLOW ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL STRUCTURES ADJUST FAST ENOUGH TO THIS NEW REALITY
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50001 I THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50002 BUT NOW I REALIZE THAT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO THE STORY
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50003 THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD WHO DON'T NECESSARILY MAKE IT IN THEIR CHOSEN CAREERS
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50004 THE WORST AND PROBABLY MOST DIFFICULT DAY IN MY LIFE WAS SEPTEMBER 3RD 1988
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50005 I WAS ABOUT FIVE YEARS OLD
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50006 AND MY MOTHER AND I WERE IN THE KITCHEN IN OUR HOUSE IN LONDON
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50007 WE'D JUST GOTTEN BACK FROM A WEDDING IN NIGERIA
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50008 AND THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO COME HOME ON SEPTEMBER 3RD 1988
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50009 AND WE WERE WAITING AND WAITING
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50010 AND THEN LATER ON THAT DAY MY MOTHER GOT A PHONE CALL FROM A FAMILY FRIEND IN NIGERIA AND THE
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50011 EVERYONE IN THE CAR DIED INSTANTLY APART FROM ONE PERSON IN THE BACK SEAT WHERE MY FATHER AND MY BROTHER WERE SITTING
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50012 MY MOTHER WAS PREGNANT AT THE TIME
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50013 AND THEN NO TELEVISION EXPANDED INTO NO PHONES NO CABLE NO MUSIC
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50014 I WORKED VERY HARD I GOT STRAIGHT A'S AND I WENT TO OXFORD
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50015 I WAS RAISED IN A SINGLE PARENT FAMILY WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY AND THEREFORE I FOUND IT
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50016 AND THE REASON WHY I SHARE THAT IS BECAUSE I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT SUCCESS IS NEVER REALLY IN A STRAIGHT LINE
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50017 WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50018 THAT'S ALL I REALLY KNEW HOW TO DO
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50019 SO IT TOOK THEM SEVERAL MONTHS TO GET BACK TO ME
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50020 AND DURING THAT TIME THE RECESSION KICKED IN AND I LOST MY JOB
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50021 SO EVENTUALLY AFTER EMAILING AND PESTERING CONSTANTLY THEY EVENTUALLY GOT BACK TO ME
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50022 SO I DON'T BELIEVE IN COMPETITION
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50023 I BELIEVE IN CREATING WHAT I WANT
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50024 USUALLY WHAT THEY SAY IS IF YOU WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL YOU NEED TO NETWORK HAVE A BRAND STUDY YOUR COMPETITION
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50025 AND SHE HAD SOME PRACTICAL ADVICE AS WELL BUT SUDDENLY THE MORAL OF HER STORY WAS THAT THE MORE YOU GIVE THE MORE
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50026 AND SO THAT COULD BE ANYTHING FROM BEING A SPORTS REPORTER TO BEING A POLITICAL REPORTER OR A BUSINESS REPORTER
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50027 SO AFTER DOING THAT FOR A FEW YEARS EVENTUALLY BY PURE CHANCE I HAPPENED TO MEET AN EXECUTIVE AT
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50028 SO WHEN I MET HIM HE GAVE ME ABOUT TWO WEEKS TO COME IN FOR A SCREEN TEST AND
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50029 SO THIS IS A LESSON AS WELL THAT I HAD LEARNED FROM MY OLDER BROTHER
trainval/BT2XlI8oeh0/50030 YOU JUST HAVE TO BE READY
trainval/bTE0MRRXNzs/50001 YOU WOULD THINK THAT BECAUSE THESE IMPLANTS ARE OPTIMIZED FOR SPEECH THEY WERE DESIGNED FOR SPEECH
trainval/bTE0MRRXNzs/50002 THE BRAINS REMAIN HARDWIRED FOR MUSIC
trainval/bTE0MRRXNzs/50003 YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO HEAR IT
trainval/btF6nKHo2i0/50001 THEY'RE TRYING BUT THEY CAN'T DO IT
trainval/btF6nKHo2i0/50002 WE HAVE TO CHANGE
trainval/btF6nKHo2i0/50003 AND WE MUST CHANGE THAT
trainval/btF6nKHo2i0/50004 WE HAVE THE POWER
trainval/btF6nKHo2i0/50005 SO NUMBER ONE
trainval/btF6nKHo2i0/50006 LOOK FOR AND SPREAD THE STORY BEHIND THE STORY
trainval/btF6nKHo2i0/50007 SO I SUGGEST TO YOU
trainval/btF6nKHo2i0/50008 I THINK YOU AND I
trainval/btF6nKHo2i0/50009 PEOPLE ARE WAKING UP ACROSS THE PLANET
trainval/btF6nKHo2i0/50010 THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE
trainval/btItLAjT5zg/50001 BUT YET HE'S STILL STANDING UNDER MY SIGN WITH A SIGN THAT SAYS HE WANTS A JOB
trainval/btItLAjT5zg/50002 HE WANTS A JOB
trainval/btItLAjT5zg/50003 I WENT BACK TO MY OFFICE GATHERED MY STAFF AROUND AND SAID
trainval/btItLAjT5zg/50004 FIRST ONE IS
trainval/btItLAjT5zg/50005 IS THERE ANYTHING LEFT TO DO IN YOUR CITY
trainval/btItLAjT5zg/50006 YOU SEE IT TAKES ME TWO WEEKS MAYBE TWO MONTHS SOMETIMES TO ONBOARD AN EMPLOYEE WITH THE CITY OF
trainval/btItLAjT5zg/50007 ALBUQUERQUE NEW MEXICO
trainval/btItLAjT5zg/50008 WE PAY OUR PANHANDLERS 9 AN HOUR
trainval/btItLAjT5zg/50009 WE FEED THEM ONCE AT THE JOB SITE
trainval/btItLAjT5zg/50010 BUT WE ALSO HAD TO HAVE COMMUNITY TRUST
trainval/btItLAjT5zg/50011 WE CAN TELL THE TAXPAYERS WE CAN SAVE YOU 31
trainval/btItLAjT5zg/50012 6 OVER THE COST OF LEAVING SOMEONE TO STRUGGLE FOR SURVIVAL ON THE STREETS
trainval/btItLAjT5zg/50013 SO WE HAD THAT COMMUNITY TRUST BUT WE HAD TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF AN HONEST CONVERSATION ALSO AS A COMMUNITY
trainval/btItLAjT5zg/50014 WE HAD TO GET PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN THEY HAND 5 OUT THE WINDOW THEY MIGHT BE
trainval/btItLAjT5zg/50015 ABSOLUTELY IT'S MAKING A DIFFERENCE
trainval/btItLAjT5zg/50016 ALBUQUERQUE IS NOW ONE OF THE NATIONAL LEADERS IN COMBATING SOME OF THE MOST STUBBORN AND PERSISTENT SOCIAL ISSUES
trainval/btItLAjT5zg/50017 ARE YOU READY TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THESE PERSISTENT SOCIAL ISSUES
trainval/btItLAjT5zg/50019 THEY SEE THAT THEY CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE
trainval/btItLAjT5zg/50020 AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN THEY GET BACK TO ST
trainval/btlF4ZSAoFc/50001 I WENT TO HOLLAND I WENT TO DENMARK
trainval/btlF4ZSAoFc/50002 THAT WAS MY DREAM
trainval/btlF4ZSAoFc/50003 SO THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS
trainval/btlF4ZSAoFc/50004 I WAS SHAKING
trainval/btlF4ZSAoFc/50006 AM I JUST GOING TO
trainval/btlF4ZSAoFc/50007 SECOND HARD WORK
trainval/btlF4ZSAoFc/50008 I PRACTICED LIKE CRAZY
trainval/btlF4ZSAoFc/50009 BUT I DID THEM DIFFERENTLY IN MY UNIQUE WAY
trainval/bUaU9kdt9I8/50001 I PLAYED JUROR NUMBER 3
trainval/bUaU9kdt9I8/50002 I HAVE SOME FRIENDS
trainval/bUaU9kdt9I8/50003 WE DID 12 ANGRY WOMEN I'M GOING TO PUT ON HAMLET
trainval/bUaU9kdt9I8/50004 BUT I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE STOPPED AND THOUGHT
trainval/bUaU9kdt9I8/50005 HOLD ON I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO EXPERIENCE WITH ANY OF THIS
trainval/bUaU9kdt9I8/50006 I DID HAVE SOME GREAT INITIAL SUPPORT
trainval/bUaU9kdt9I8/50007 I WENT TO MY FRIEND JAMILA AND SHE SAID ONLY IF I CAN PLAY HORATIO
trainval/bUaU9kdt9I8/50008 SO AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED I HAD THE SUPPORT AND THE RESOURCES I NEEDED
trainval/bUaU9kdt9I8/50009 I WOULD EVEN MEMORIZE LINES FROM SOME OF THE PLAYS LIKE ONE TIME SHE WAS IN THIS PLAY CALLED SLAVS BY TONY
trainval/bUaU9kdt9I8/50010 WE PERFORMED HAMLET IN MY BACKYARD AND PEOPLE CAME AND ENJOYED IT
trainval/bUaU9kdt9I8/50011 AND WE HAD FUN
trainval/bUaU9kdt9I8/50012 WE WERE DOING SHAKESPEARE TOGETHER IN MY BACKYARD WE WERE WORKING ON THIS AMAZING MATERIAL
trainval/bUaU9kdt9I8/50013 I WOULD RECITE THEM TO MY MOM SOMETIMES AND SHE WOULD SAY YEAH THAT'S GREAT HONEY JUST DON'T SAY THAT IN FRONT OF
trainval/bUaU9kdt9I8/50014 AND IT WASN'T JUST ME I WAS WATCHING MY FRIENDS MOST OF THEM WHO HAD NEVER BEEN IN PLAYS BEFORE
trainval/bUaU9kdt9I8/50015 I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE REALLY TERRIBLE EXPERIENCES WITH SHAKESPEARE BECAUSE THEY FIRST LEARN ABOUT HIM
trainval/bUaU9kdt9I8/50016 I DID TAKE A CLASS ON SHAKESPEARE AND I HAD TO WRITE ESSAYS ABOUT HIS PLAYS WHICH I VERY ENJOYED BY THE
trainval/bUaU9kdt9I8/50017 NOBODY TOLD ME TO DO THIS I HAD THE IDEA ON MY OWN AND I CARRIED IT THROUGH ON MY OWN
trainval/buHSvs7LFzw/50001 CAN I PAY THE BILLS AT THE END OF THE MONTH
trainval/buHSvs7LFzw/50002 I WORKED ON DEVELOPMENT AND AGRICULTURE ISSUES IN THE U
trainval/buHSvs7LFzw/50003 THEY PRODUCED HEAT AND A LITTLE BIT OF LIGHT ON THE SIDE
trainval/buHSvs7LFzw/50004 SO THINK ABOUT THAT
trainval/buHSvs7LFzw/50005 SO LEDS ARE FANTASTIC
trainval/buHSvs7LFzw/50006 WE WILL GO ALL IN
trainval/buHSvs7LFzw/50007 PROBABLY MANY PEOPLE ARE WEARING COTTON RIGHT NOW
trainval/buHSvs7LFzw/50008 IT'S REALLY DIRTY IN PRODUCTION
trainval/buHSvs7LFzw/50009 FARMERS ARE COMING OUT OF POVERTY
trainval/buHSvs7LFzw/50010 ACTUALLY WE FOUND 100 PERCENT IS EASIER TO DO THAN 90 PERCENT OR 50 PERCENT
trainval/buHSvs7LFzw/50012 THE ELECTRICITY IS FREE
trainval/buHSvs7LFzw/50013 WE ALSO HAVE A FOUNDATION THAT'S COMMITTED TO WORK THROUGH PARTNERS AND HELP IMPROVE THE LIVES AND PROTECT THE
trainval/buHSvs7LFzw/50014 AND WE'VE DECIDED IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS WE WILL DOUBLE THE VOLUME OF CERTIFIED MATERIAL WE PUT THROUGH OUR BUSINESS
trainval/buHSvs7LFzw/50015 SO LET'S TAKE AN EXAMPLE MEASURE THE THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT IN YOUR BUSINESS
trainval/BURbLmQL1BE/50001 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/buRLc2eWGPQ/50002 HOLLYWOOD HAS A SORDID HISTORY OF CASTING ABLE BODIED ACTORS TO PLAY DISABLED
trainval/buRLc2eWGPQ/50003 AND I KNEW THAT I WOULD BE PROMOTED FROM DINER DINER TO WACKY BEST FRIEND
trainval/buRLc2eWGPQ/50004 YOU CAN'T CATCH IT
trainval/buRLc2eWGPQ/50005 COME ON A JOURNEY WITH ME
trainval/buRLc2eWGPQ/50006 MY INNER STRIPPER WAS VERY STRONG
trainval/buRLc2eWGPQ/50007 I DON'T THINK ANYONE EVEN NOTICED WE WEREN'T ITALIAN
trainval/buRLc2eWGPQ/50008 MY BIG BREAK CAME IN 2010
trainval/buRLc2eWGPQ/50009 BUT NOT ONLY DID MR
trainval/buRLc2eWGPQ/50010 SUDDENLY MY DISABILITY ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB IS FAIR GAME
trainval/buRLc2eWGPQ/50011 YO IS SHE RETARDED
trainval/buRLc2eWGPQ/50012 WHAT DOES SHE SUFFER FROM
trainval/buRLc2eWGPQ/50013 THE DOCTORS SAID THAT I WOULDN'T WALK BUT I AM HERE IN FRONT OF YOU
trainval/buRLc2eWGPQ/50014 I GREW UP WATCHING WHOOPI GOLDBERG ROSEANNE BARR ELLEN AND ALL OF THESE WOMEN HAD ONE THING IN
trainval/buRLc2eWGPQ/50015 HOWEVER IF I GREW UP WITH SOCIAL MEDIA I DON'T THINK I WOULD BE
trainval/buRLc2eWGPQ/50016 I HOPE THAT TOGETHER WE CAN CREATE MORE POSITIVE IMAGES OF DISABILITY IN THE MEDIA
trainval/buRLc2eWGPQ/50017 SO I BECAME A COMIC
trainval/bvAEJ8G9l9U/50001 AND I HEARD THAT AND THAT WAS ALL I NEEDED
trainval/bvAEJ8G9l9U/50002 THAT'S HOW TOUGH IT WAS
trainval/bvAEJ8G9l9U/50003 I WANTED TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF IMPACT
trainval/bvAEJ8G9l9U/50004 I'M GUESSING THIS ROOM IS DIFFERENT BUT THAT'S THE AVERAGE THAT DELOITTE HAS DONE WITH THEIR STUDIES
trainval/bvAEJ8G9l9U/50005 SO I WANTED TO FIND OUT WHAT IS IT THAT SETS THESE PEOPLE APART THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE PASSIONATE WORLD CHANGING WORK THAT WAKE UP INSPIRED
trainval/bvAEJ8G9l9U/50006 I DON'T LIKE MY JOB
trainval/bvAEJ8G9l9U/50007 BUT I WOULD HAVE TO WARN THEM BECAUSE AT THIS POINT MY QUIT RATE WAS ALSO 80 PERCENT
trainval/bvAEJ8G9l9U/50008 AND THE THING IS THAT NO ONE IS GOING TO DO THIS FOR US
trainval/bvAEJ8G9l9U/50009 IT'S ALL ABOUT JUST BUILDING YOUR RESUME
trainval/bvAEJ8G9l9U/50010 YOU KNOW BEFORE THIS A PASSION COULD COME AND HIT YOU IN THE FACE OR MAYBE IN YOUR POSSIBLE LINE OF WORK YOU MIGHT THROW IT AWAY
trainval/bvAEJ8G9l9U/50011 EITHER WAY WE START TO BELIEVE IT
trainval/bvAEJ8G9l9U/50012 EITHER WE GIVE UP OR WE NEVER START IN THE FIRST PLACE
trainval/bvAEJ8G9l9U/50013 THE THINGS IS EVERYONE WAS IMPOSSIBLE UNTIL SOMEBODY DID IT
trainval/bvAEJ8G9l9U/50014 EVERY INVENTION EVERY NEW THING IN THE WORLD PEOPLE THOUGHT WERE CRAZY AT FIRST
trainval/bvAEJ8G9l9U/50016 I'M TERRIFIED OF DEEP DARK BLUE WATER
trainval/bvAEJ8G9l9U/50019 YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SINK
trainval/bvAEJ8G9l9U/50020 I JUST HAD NO IDEA HE WAS GOING TO SWIM
trainval/bvAEJ8G9l9U/50021 YOU ARE THE AVERAGE OF THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU SPEND THE MOST TIME WITH
trainval/bvAEJ8G9l9U/50022 IN 1898 NORMAN TRIPLETT DID THIS STUDY WITH A BUNCH OF CYCLISTS AND HE WOULD MEASURE THEIR TIMES AROUND THE
trainval/bvAEJ8G9l9U/50023 AND ONE OF MY FRIENDS NOW HE HAS A FAMILY OF EIGHT AND HE SUPPORTS HIS WHOLE FAMILY
trainval/bvAEJ8G9l9U/50024 THIS BLEW MY MIND
trainval/bvAEJ8G9l9U/50026 AND THOSE PEOPLE HAVE MADE UP THAT COMMUNITY OF PASSIONATE FOLKS WHO INSPIRED THAT POSSIBILITY THAT I
trainval/bvAEJ8G9l9U/50027 MOST THINGS ARE TOTALLY OUT OF OUR HANDS
trainval/bvAEJ8G9l9U/50028 AND THAT'S ALREADY STARTING TO HAPPEN
trainval/bvAEJ8G9l9U/50029 WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE
trainval/bVV2Zk88beY/50001 ONCE I SAW THAT WE WERE NOT THE ULTIMATE ARBITERS OF DIVINE TRUTH BUT FLAWED HUMAN BEINGS I COULDN'T PRETEND
trainval/bVV2Zk88beY/50002 THEY TREATED US LIKE FAMILY
trainval/bVV2Zk88beY/50003 THIS HAS BEEN AT THE FRONT OF MY MIND LATELY BECAUSE I CAN'T HELP BUT SEE IN OUR PUBLIC DISCOURSE SO MANY OF THE
trainval/bVV2Zk88beY/50004 ASSUMING ILL MOTIVES ALMOST INSTANTLY CUTS US OFF FROM TRULY UNDERSTANDING WHY SOMEONE DOES AND BELIEVES AS
trainval/bVV2Zk88beY/50005 WE EVEN TARGET PEOPLE ON OUR OWN SIDE WHEN THEY DARE TO QUESTION THE PARTY LINE
trainval/bVV2Zk88beY/50006 WE HAVE A BUFFER OF TIME AND SPACE BETWEEN US AND THE PEOPLE WHOSE IDEAS WE FIND SO FRUSTRATING
trainval/bVV2Zk88beY/50007 ESCALATING DISGUST AND INTRACTABLE CONFLICT ARE NOT WHAT WE WANT FOR OURSELVES OR OUR COUNTRY OR OUR
trainval/bVV2Zk88beY/50008 MY MOM SAID SOMETHING TO ME A FEW WEEKS BEFORE I LEFT WESTBORO WHEN I WAS DESPERATELY HOPING THERE
trainval/BwC4WRKi5QY/50001 IN MY PREVIOUS LIFE BEFORE I STARTED BITTY FOODS I WAS A TREND FORECASTER AND CONSUMER
trainval/BwC4WRKi5QY/50002 BY THE YEAR 2050 THERE WILL BE AN ADDITIONAL 2 BILLION PEOPLE ON THE PLANET AND ECONOMISTS SAY THAT WE
trainval/BwC4WRKi5QY/50003 ECONOMISTS SAY THAT BY THE YEAR 2050 MEAT WILL BECOME A LUXURY PRODUCT
trainval/BwC4WRKi5QY/50004 IN THEIR DIREST ESTIMATES BEEF WILL BE PRICED LIKE CAVIAR
trainval/BwC4WRKi5QY/50005 I CAN'T THINK OF ANOTHER FOOD SOURCE THAT COULD HAVE THIS KIND OF IMPACT ON BOTH THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
trainval/BwC4WRKi5QY/50006 TO HELP FOSTER THAT CULTURAL CHANGE I'M STARTING WITH THE CRICKET
trainval/BwIGcvBGSRk/50001 BUT IT'S A MATTER OF SCALE
trainval/BwIGcvBGSRk/50002 BUT WHAT ABOUT IRAQ
trainval/BwIGcvBGSRk/50003 HOW IS IRAQ AFFECTED BY THOSE CHANGES
trainval/BwIGcvBGSRk/50004 ALTHOUGH THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICAN COUNTRIES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE AMONG THE LOWEST
trainval/BwIGcvBGSRk/50005 THE SHARYEE IS A SOUTHERN WIND THAT USUALLY BLOWS LATE APRIL AND LATE
trainval/BwIGcvBGSRk/50006 AND WHY IS THAT
trainval/BwIGcvBGSRk/50007 MOST OF THE TIME IT'S BECAUSE OF A DUST STORM EPISODE HAPPENING IN BAGHDAD BASRAH OR THE
trainval/BwIGcvBGSRk/50008 WE WERE DRINKING CHAI AND WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS AREA
trainval/BwIGcvBGSRk/50009 BUT THE WORLD IN A WAY IS FIGHTING BACK
trainval/BwIGcvBGSRk/50010 AND WHAT ABOUT IRAQ
trainval/BwIGcvBGSRk/50011 IS IRAQ AN ACTIVE PART OF THIS GAME OR NOT
trainval/BwIGcvBGSRk/50012 I WORK WITH THOSE PEOPLE I SEE THOSE PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE DAY AND ACTUALLY THIS WAS ONE OF THE REASONS
trainval/BwIGcvBGSRk/50013 SO LET'S START WITH THE RIGHT FOOT WHEN IT COMES TO ENVIRONMENT
trainval/BwIGcvBGSRk/50014 LET'S SET IRAQ AS AN EXAMPLE AS A BENCHMARK FOR THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES AND
trainval/BwIGcvBGSRk/50015 THE BEGINNING BEGINS RIGHT
trainval/BwOd20Mv0hM/50001 YOU MIGHT NOT BELIEVE IT BUT EVEN OUR OWN BODIES ARE RADIOACTIVE ENOUGH TO DISTURB THIS EXPERIMENT
trainval/BWWPZlaq35U/50001 I REACHED OUT TO WHAT WAS NOW MY FORMER PARTNER OF FOUR YEARS AND TOLD THEM
trainval/BWWPZlaq35U/50002 I'VE FOUND MEDICATION WHICH WORKS FOR ME
trainval/BWWPZlaq35U/50003 AND FOR A LONG TIME I VIEWED THEM EXACTLY THAT WAY
trainval/BWWPZlaq35U/50004 MANY MEN STRUGGLE WITH WHAT THEIR IDENTITY IS AND THUS RELY ON THESE OUTDATED IDEAS OF
trainval/bX32UShfri4/50001 IN FACT I LOST ABOUT 5 LITERS OF BLOOD WHICH IS ALL SOMEONE MY SIZE WOULD ACTUALLY HOLD
trainval/bX32UShfri4/50002 I HAD AN AWARENESS OF BEING IN MY BODY BUT ALSO BEING OUT OF MY BODY SOMEWHERE ELSE WATCHING FROM ABOVE
trainval/bX32UShfri4/50003 AS WE MADE OUR WAY UP TOWARDS THE SPECTACULAR BLUE MOUNTAINS WEST OF SYDNEY IT WAS THE PERFECT
trainval/bX32UShfri4/50004 THAT BODY IS BROKEN
trainval/bX32UShfri4/50005 THEY TOOK OUT TWO OF MY BROKEN RIBS AND THEY REBUILT MY BACK L1
trainval/bX32UShfri4/50006 THEY REBUILT IT
trainval/bX32UShfri4/50008 THEY TOOK AN ENTIRE HOUR TO STITCH ME UP
trainval/bX32UShfri4/50009 I WOKE UP IN INTENSIVE CARE AND THE DOCTORS WERE REALLY EXCITED THAT THE OPERATION HAD BEEN A SUCCESS BECAUSE AT THAT
trainval/bX32UShfri4/50011 I HAD NO MOVEMENT IN MY LEGS
trainval/bX32UShfri4/50012 I HAD A NECK BRACE AND SAND BAGS ON EITHER SIDE OF MY HEAD AND I SAW MY WORLD THROUGH A MIRROR THAT WAS SUSPENDED
trainval/bX32UShfri4/50013 AND THERE NO SUPERFICIAL CONVERSATIONS AS WE SHARED OUR INNERMOST THOUGHTS OUR FEARS AND OUR
trainval/bX32UShfri4/50014 AND I PRACTICED MY WALKING AS MUCH AS I COULD
trainval/bX32UShfri4/50015 AND LITTLE GOALS KEPT ME GOING ALONG THE WAY
trainval/bX32UShfri4/50016 I WANTED MY OLD LIFE BACK
trainval/bX32UShfri4/50017 I WANTED MY BODY BACK
trainval/bX32UShfri4/50018 AND I SAID WHAT
trainval/bX32UShfri4/50019 I WAS WORRIED
trainval/bX32UShfri4/50020 SHE SAID THAT'S NICE DEAR
trainval/bX32UShfri4/50021 IS THAT A PROBLEM
trainval/bX32UShfri4/50022 YOU'RE IN A WHEELCHAIR THAT'S NORMAL
trainval/bX32UShfri4/50023 AND THEN I THOUGHT WHY STOP THERE
trainval/BXcFEhl7ynM/50001 CHALLENGE AS AN EXAMPLE
trainval/BxFvxKaSmWo/50001 AND I SAID YES
trainval/BxFvxKaSmWo/50002 AND HE SAID WHY CAN'T I
trainval/BxFvxKaSmWo/50003 WHAT ARE WE
trainval/BxFvxKaSmWo/50004 NOBODY EVER WILL
trainval/BxFvxKaSmWo/50005 WE CAN'T SEE INTO THE ENGINE ROOM
trainval/BxFvxKaSmWo/50006 SLIGHTLY TECHNICAL SOME PHYSICISTS WILL DISAGREE WITH THIS
trainval/BxFvxKaSmWo/50007 DON'T LET ANYONE TELL YOU THEY UNDERSTAND ELECTRICITY
trainval/BxFvxKaSmWo/50008 ELECTRONS DISAPPEAR IN A KIND OF FUZZ AND THERE IS ONLY ENERGY
trainval/BxFvxKaSmWo/50009 BUT WE CAN'T SEE WHAT'S THE MATTER
trainval/BxFvxKaSmWo/50010 I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS
trainval/BxFvxKaSmWo/50011 YOU CAN'T SEE THE FUTURE OBVIOUSLY
trainval/BxFvxKaSmWo/50012 AND YOU CAN'T SEE THE PAST EXCEPT IN YOUR MEMORY
trainval/BxFvxKaSmWo/50013 WHAT'S THE POINT OF THESE RADIO WAVES THAT YOU'VE FOUND
trainval/BxFvxKaSmWo/50014 AND HE SAID WELL I'VE NO IDEA
trainval/BxFvxKaSmWo/50015 BUT I GUESS SOMEBODY WILL FIND A USE FOR THEM SOMEDAY
trainval/BxFvxKaSmWo/50016 THE POINT MOST OF US
trainval/bxkslfQc0EA/50001 I JUST MISSED HER
trainval/bxkslfQc0EA/50002 AFTER SHE WAS GONE I EVEN QUESTIONED THE VALUE OF HER LIFE SO WHILE HER DEATH WRUNG OUT MY HEART
trainval/bxkslfQc0EA/50003 THAT HAPPENED THE DAY SOMEONE CALLED ME A MANIPULATOR
trainval/bxkslfQc0EA/50004 WHY WERE MY LIFE'S GREATEST LESSONS PREDICATED ON HER PAIN
trainval/bxkslfQc0EA/50005 AND WHY DID MY STORY CIRCLE AROUND HERS
trainval/bxkslfQc0EA/50006 OKAY BESIDES NORMAN BATES
trainval/bxkslfQc0EA/50007 AND TRULY IN THAT MOMENT THAT WOMAN AND EVERY WOMAN LIKE HER BECAME MY MOTHER
trainval/bxkslfQc0EA/50008 BUT WHAT IF WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THE NATURE OF CHOICE MAKING ALL WRONG
trainval/bxkslfQc0EA/50009 NOW I DIDN'T SIT DOWN ONE DAY AND WRITE A LIST OF MY BESTIES AND MOMS JUST HAPPENED TO BE AT THE TOP
trainval/bxkslfQc0EA/50010 SO WHAT TAKES THE PLACE OF THAT HEALTHY SUPPORT SYSTEM NOW OUT OF REACH
trainval/bxkslfQc0EA/50011 REHABILITATION AS AN OPERATIVE DEFINITION THAT IS PEOPLE CENTERED RATHER THAN SYSTEM CENTERED
trainval/bxkslfQc0EA/50012 EVERY TIME I'VE BEEN THAT MODEL FOR SOMEONE ELSE LIVES HAVE CHANGED
trainval/bxkslfQc0EA/50013 DON'T ASSUME THAT SOMEONE ELSE'S STORY DOESN'T HAVE VALUE SIMPLY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MEASURE UP TO
trainval/bxkslfQc0EA/50014 AND THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR ME WAS ARTICULATING THIS CONCEPT OF REHABILITATION SIMPLY BECAUSE IT WAS
trainval/bxkslfQc0EA/50015 WE TALKED ABOUT WRITING NEW POLICIES RELAXING THE RULES OF EXISTING POLICY OR CREATING NEW
trainval/bxkslfQc0EA/50016 CRACKED SIDEWALKS BE DAMNED
trainval/bxkslfQc0EA/50017 SETTING ASIDE THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT AID IN OVERCOMING ADVERSITY MOST PEOPLE COME
trainval/bXmDaykZobc/50001 I WANT TO SHARE SOMETHING THAT I'VE DISCOVERED
trainval/bXmDaykZobc/50002 NOW HOW CAN THIS BE
trainval/bXnTAnsVfN8/50001 THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF MY DAD REALLY TRYING TO COME AROUND TO ME BEING TRANSGENDER AND EVERYONE IN MY FAMILY HELPED
trainval/bXnTAnsVfN8/50002 AND IT PUT NO STRAIN ON THE OTHER STUDENTS BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL USED INTO IT WITH ME
trainval/bXnTAnsVfN8/50003 AFTER A FEW MONTHS OF ISOLATION I DECIDED TO START USING THE GIRLS' BATHROOM AGAIN OF MY OWN ACCORD
trainval/bXnTAnsVfN8/50004 I DIDN'T HAVE ANY SLEEPOVERS I DIDN'T VISIT ANY FRIENDS I WAS LIKE A GHOST
trainval/bXnTAnsVfN8/50005 AND THE BEST PART WAS MY PARENTS TOLD US THAT AT HIS NEW SCHOOL WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO HIDE ANYMORE
trainval/bXnTAnsVfN8/50006 SO AT WAYNFLETE THEY START EACH SCHOOL YEAR OFF BY SENDING THE STUDENTS ON A BONDING TRIP
trainval/bXnTAnsVfN8/50007 IN THOSE TWO YEARS OF BEING SO DILIGENT AT KEEPING MY SECRET I HAD ACTUALLY FORGOTTEN HOW TO COME OUT TO
trainval/bXnTAnsVfN8/50008 IT HAD BEEN SO EASY WHEN I WAS YOUNGER
trainval/bXnTAnsVfN8/50009 MY NAME'S WYATT
trainval/bXnTAnsVfN8/50010 AND I LATCHED ONTO THIS KID
trainval/bXnTAnsVfN8/50011 AND SHE GAVE ME THE CONFIDENCE TO KEEP COMING OUT TO OTHER KIDS AT WAYNFLETE AS THE WEEKS WENT ON
trainval/bXnTAnsVfN8/50012 WE DON'T GET TO FOCUS ON
trainval/bXnTAnsVfN8/50013 PASSPORTS LICENSES TAXES APPLICATIONS EVEN BATHROOMS
trainval/bXnTAnsVfN8/50014 YOU HAVE THE POWER TO EDUCATE OTHERS AND YOURSELF
trainval/by3NnWvSCj8/50001 I ALSO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE WORD BIMAR
trainval/by3NnWvSCj8/50002 SO I WENT THROUGH ALL THE USUAL QUESTIONS
trainval/by3NnWvSCj8/50003 I ASKED HIM ABOUT PRESENTING COMPLAINT HIS MEDICAL HISTORY HIS DRUG HISTORY ALLERGIES
trainval/by3NnWvSCj8/50004 EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN TRAINED TO DO
trainval/by3NnWvSCj8/50005 THIS WASN'T EASILY ACCEPTED BY EVERYBODY AROUND ME
trainval/by3NnWvSCj8/50006 I HAD A LOT OF
trainval/by3NnWvSCj8/50007 BUT YOU SPENT SEVEN YEARS TRAINING TO BE A DOCTOR
trainval/by3NnWvSCj8/50008 AND MY BROTHER TURNED AROUND TO ME AND SAID I'M REALLY CONCERNED THAT YOU CAN'T KEEP A NORMAL JOB FOR MORE
trainval/by3NnWvSCj8/50009 I DON T BLAME THEM
trainval/by3NnWvSCj8/50010 IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT I'VE GONE A LITTLE BIT OFF TRACK
trainval/by3NnWvSCj8/50011 MEDICINE IS COMPLICATED
trainval/by3NnWvSCj8/50012 WE HAVE SET GUIDELINES
trainval/by3NnWvSCj8/50013 THEY ARE HARD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER AS THEY ARE
trainval/by3NnWvSCj8/50014 POTENTIALLY THEY HAVEN'T REPRESENT OUR HUMAN BODY
trainval/bybOi0nMmq0/50001 TURMOIL LETS OUT THE FIGHT IN ME
trainval/ByEoeBYUwOo/50001 5 BILLION KILOMETERS
trainval/ByEoeBYUwOo/50002 SO THE NEXT TIME YOU'RE IN AN AIRPLANE SNAG A WINDOW SEAT LOOK OUT AND IMAGINE A ROCK SO ENORMOUS THAT
trainval/ByEoeBYUwOo/50003 WE'VE REPURPOSED IT TO DISCOVER AND STUDY ASTEROIDS
trainval/ByEoeBYUwOo/50004 ONE OF THE REASONS NEOWISE IS SO VALUABLE IS THAT IT SEES THE SKY IN THE THERMAL INFRARED
trainval/ByEoeBYUwOo/50005 BUT THE JOB'S NOT DONE YET
trainval/ByEoeBYUwOo/50006 WHAT WE NEED TO DO NOW IS MAP NEAR EARTH SPACE
trainval/BYeYVuqD8kU/50001 7 MILLION SPECIES
trainval/BYeYVuqD8kU/50002 WE'VE LOOKED OTHER PLACES MAYBE NOT AS HARD AS WE SHOULD OR WE COULD BUT WE'VE LOOKED AND HAVEN'T FOUND ANY EARTH IS THE ONLY
trainval/BYeYVuqD8kU/50003 AND MANY SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES DON'T HAVE LIQUID WATER AND SO WE DON'T LOOK THERE
trainval/BYeYVuqD8kU/50004 THIS CAN'T HAPPEN ON MARS TODAY
trainval/BYeYVuqD8kU/50005 THE ATMOSPHERE OF MARS TODAY IS TOO THIN AND TOO COLD FOR WATER TO BE STABLE AS A LIQUID
trainval/BYeYVuqD8kU/50006 HOW DO ATMOSPHERES GET THEIR ENERGY FOR ESCAPE
trainval/BYeYVuqD8kU/50007 AND OF COURSE DISTANCE OF A PLANET FROM THE SUN DETERMINES ITS TEMPERATURE
trainval/BYeYVuqD8kU/50008 THIS HAS TO PLAY INTO HABITABILITY
trainval/BYeYVuqD8kU/50009 BUT MAYBE THERE ARE OTHER THINGS WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT
trainval/BYeYVuqD8kU/50010 ATMOSPHERE HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO ESCAPE
trainval/BYeYVuqD8kU/50011 WE HAVE THE OBSERVATIONS OF THOSE PLANETS BUT WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHICH ONES ARE HABITABLE YET
trainval/bYGLzDB4GJo/50001 EVERY TIME THAT OUR BODY BREAKS WE PATCH IT UP BY DRUGS OR WE PATCH IT UP BY AS
trainval/bYGLzDB4GJo/50002 AND THAT'S EXTREMELY EXTREMELY SCARY THAT WE'RE LETTING DOCTORS MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON PATTERN
trainval/bYGLzDB4GJo/50003 TAKE THAT IN FOR ONE MINUTE
trainval/bYGLzDB4GJo/50004 I WANT TO SEE A FUTURE WHERE WE CAN DO INFORMATION TRACKING AND MANAGE THE FLOW OF DISEASES
trainval/byHcqsGvcj8/50001 I REALIZE THAT CONSUMERS ARE GETTING SMARTER AND THEY WERE LOOKING FOR GOOD PRODUCTS THAT WOULD MAKE THEM
trainval/ByuWS1bBwpc/50001 AND THEY MIGRATE THROUGH THE EMBRYO TO COLONIZE THE GONAD
trainval/ByuWS1bBwpc/50002 SO THEN WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THESE CELLS IN CULTURE IS THAT WE CAN ADD A GENE TO MARK THEM
trainval/ByuWS1bBwpc/50003 IN THIS CASE GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN
trainval/ByuWS1bBwpc/50004 AND WE IMPLANT THAT IN
trainval/ByuWS1bBwpc/50005 WE GROW UP THAT SURROGATE HOST UNTIL IT BECOMES AN ADULT COCKEREL
trainval/ByuWS1bBwpc/50006 THIS OFFERS US A NEW OPPORTUNITY
trainval/ByuWS1bBwpc/50007 WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENT SORT OF FROZEN ZOO
trainval/ByuWS1bBwpc/50008 WELL THE THING ABOUT THESE SEX STEM CELLS IN BIRDS IS THAT THEY'RE PROMISCUOUS
trainval/ByuWS1bBwpc/50009 IN THIS CASE FROM THE PASSENGER PIGEON INTO THE BAND TAILED PIGEON
trainval/bz3AtnMH7nU/50001 I WANT SOMEONE TO LOVE ME AND MAKE ME FEEL SPECIAL
trainval/bz3AtnMH7nU/50002 I ASKED HER WHY DO YOU THINK PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY NEED A RELATIONSHIP TO BE HAPPY
trainval/bz3AtnMH7nU/50003 YOU CAN BE IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH ANYONE BUT IT DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE YOU HAPPY
trainval/bZ3qQySIPgI/50001 WHAT IF THAT WERE THE RISK SHE TOOK EVERYDAY JUST WALKING TO SCHOOL
trainval/bZ3qQySIPgI/50002 WOULD WE BE WILLING TO STAND UP FOR THE THOUSANDS OF GIRLS AROUND THE WORLD THAT RISK THEIR
trainval/bZ3qQySIPgI/50003 SHE HERSELF WAS A FIERCE VOICE AND A POWERFUL FIGURE THAT FOUGHT NOT JUST FOR WOMEN BUT ALSO
trainval/BzDEFAGvShc/50001 FIRST MY BOOK PAINFUL HOPE
trainval/BzDEFAGvShc/50002 BUT I SAID NO
trainval/BzDEFAGvShc/50003 I'M NOT A VICTIM ANYMORE
trainval/bzj1BTdfoeI/50001 I MET AMANDA LEPORE I WENT TO THE BOX I SAW CLUBBING AND SAW THESE GENDERFUCKED CLUB KIDS AND MY EYES
trainval/bzj1BTdfoeI/50002 AND I REALIZED IT'S ALL ABOUT HETERONORMATIVE SPACE
trainval/bzj1BTdfoeI/50003 THERE I WAS A 19 YEAR OLD ON THE SEARCH FOR A LIVE AFFIRMING QUEER THEORY THAT BROUGHT GAY AND
trainval/bzlYyhh3X0w/50001 BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRIES THRIVE BECAUSE OF THE FEAR OF IT AND THOSE OF US WHO
trainval/bzlYyhh3X0w/50002 NOT THE LOWERCASE MUTTERED BEHIND MY BACK KIND OR THE SEEMINGLY HARMLESS CHUBBY OR CUDDLY
trainval/bzlYyhh3X0w/50003 I ALSO RECEIVE SMILES FROM STRANGERS WHO RECOGNIZE WHAT IT TAKES TO WALK DOWN THE STREET WITH A SPRING IN
trainval/bzlYyhh3X0w/50004 PEOPLE WHO HONOR OUR STRENGTH AND WORK WITH NOT AGAINST OUR PERCEIVED LIMITATIONS
trainval/bzlYyhh3X0w/50005 IT IS THIS FEAR THAT'S FEEDING THE DIET INDUSTRY WHICH IS KEEPING SO MANY OF US FROM MAKING
trainval/BZoKfap4g4w/50001 BECAUSE IT REMAINS HARD WORK FOR WOMEN TO WASH
trainval/BZoKfap4g4w/50002 AND THEN I PUT THE REALLY TOUGH QUESTION HOW MANY OF YOU HAND WASH YOUR JEANS AND YOUR BED
trainval/BZoKfap4g4w/50003 WHAT IS SPECIAL WITH THIS
trainval/BZoKfap4g4w/50004 THANK YOU STEEL MILL
trainval/BZoKfap4g4w/50005 THANK YOU POWER STATION
trainval/bZS7T5eF3hY/50001 WE TRIED TO HAVE SOME EXPERIENCES THAT WE WOULDN'T OTHERWISE HAVE
trainval/bZS7T5eF3hY/50002 WE ENGAGED WITH PEOPLE WE STAYED AT A CATTLE RANCH IN THE AUSTRALIAN BUSH COUNTRY WHERE I'M NOT QUITE SURE
trainval/bZS7T5eF3hY/50003 WE REALIZED THAT OUR LIFE WAS CHANGING AND WE WERE CHANGING WITH IT
trainval/bZS7T5eF3hY/50004 AND THAT WAS THE A HA MOMENT
trainval/bZS7T5eF3hY/50005 SO WE WATCHED THAT SUN
trainval/bZS7T5eF3hY/50006 AND THAT SUN DIDN'T SET I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT MELTED
trainval/bZS7T5eF3hY/50007 WE WERE GOING TO TAKE PHOTOS OF US WITH HIM ON MAJOR WORLD LANDMARKS
trainval/BZsdiVTFt7Y/50001 ALL MY THOUGHTS RAISED TO MY MIND FROM KEYBORD TO PAGE
trainval/BZsdiVTFt7Y/50002 AND WHAT BETTER WAY THAN WRITING A BOOK
trainval/BZsdiVTFt7Y/50003 IF YOU'VE EVER READ A CHICK FLICK BOOK BEFORE SET IN A HIGH SCHOOL SETTING CHANCES ARE THE AUTHOR HAS ALREADY PASSED THAT
trainval/c00zfzk4gdg/50001 I'M TOO WEAK
trainval/c00zfzk4gdg/50002 WHY DID SHE HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THAT
trainval/c00zfzk4gdg/50003 SHE WANTS TO REUNITE WITH HER FAMILY THERE
trainval/C0byYFXjRJM/50001 SECONDLY I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH
trainval/C0byYFXjRJM/50002 THERE ARE A COUPLE THREE IN THE MORNINGS IN SHAKESPEARE
trainval/C0byYFXjRJM/50003 THERE'S A FIVE IN THE MORNING
trainval/C0byYFXjRJM/50004 SO MY TALK HAD SOME OF MY FOUR IN THE MORNING EXAMPLES BUT IT ALSO HAD EXAMPLES FROM MY FELLOW TED SPEAKERS
trainval/C0byYFXjRJM/50005 I FOUND FOUR IN THE MORNING IN A NOVEL BY ISABEL ALLENDE
trainval/C0byYFXjRJM/50006 I FOUND A COUPLE IN THE WORK OF MATT GROENING ALTHOUGH MATT GROENING TOLD ME LATER THAT HE COULD NOT MAKE MY TALK BECAUSE IT WAS A MORNING
trainval/C0byYFXjRJM/50007 BUT THEY FOLLOWED THE PATTERN
trainval/C0byYFXjRJM/50008 THEY PLAYED ALONG
trainval/C0byYFXjRJM/50009 MAYBE THIS WAS SOME KIND OF CLICHE THAT HAD NEVER BEEN TAXONOMIZED BEFORE
trainval/C0byYFXjRJM/50010 MAYBE I WAS ON THE TRAIL OF A NEW MEME OR SOMETHING
trainval/C0byYFXjRJM/50011 COM LAUNCHED LATER THAT YEAR WITH A BUNCH OF VIDEOS FROM PAST TALKS INCLUDING MINE AND I STARTED RECEIVING FOUR IN THE
trainval/C0byYFXjRJM/50012 MUCH OF IT WAS CONTENT I NEVER WOULD HAVE FOUND ON MY OWN IF I WAS LOOKING FOR IT AND I WAS NOT
trainval/C0byYFXjRJM/50013 I REMEMBER BRINGING THEM ALL TO MY FAVORITE CORNER TABLE AND I READ POEMS PAIRED
trainval/c0H1zU2ytxA/50001 BUT FROM TEXAS CALIFORNIA VANCOUVER NEW ZEALAND IRAQ
trainval/c0H1zU2ytxA/50002 I READ SOME TO HER SHE READS SOME TO ME
trainval/C0nM8l9qeGY/50001 AND HE SAID WELL WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO SAY
trainval/C0nM8l9qeGY/50002 I HAVE NO FORMAL EDUCATION
trainval/C0nM8l9qeGY/50003 BUT WESLEYAN SAID YES AND GAVE KENNEDY A FULL SCHOLARSHIP
trainval/C0nM8l9qeGY/50004 SO WE DECIDED WHAT IF WE COULD IDENTIFY THE HIGHEST VALUE SERVICES AND BUILD THEM IN CONNECTION
trainval/C0nM8l9qeGY/50005 WE STARTED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT DOES EVERYONE WANT AND NEED AND HOW TO BUILD AN
trainval/C0nM8l9qeGY/50006 HER PERPETRATOR WAS ARRESTED BUT THREE DOLLARS WAS ENOUGH FOR THE POLICE TO WIPE HIS NAME FROM THE
trainval/C0nM8l9qeGY/50007 PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE ADVOCATES SUPPORT SYSTEMS BUILT IN
trainval/C0nM8l9qeGY/50008 WHAT DO THEY DO
trainval/C14bXC7zi84/50001 THE ONLY RULE IS THAT PERSON CAN'T BE IN THE ROOM WITH US RIGHT NOW
trainval/C14bXC7zi84/50002 SHOUT OUT MAKE SOME NOISE
trainval/C14bXC7zi84/50003 I'M GOING TO NEED TO BORROW SOMETHING ACTUALLY FROM THE AUDIENCE
trainval/C14bXC7zi84/50004 I CAN MAKE THIS 20 BUCKS CHANGE INTO WHATEVER YOU WANT
trainval/C14bXC7zi84/50005 WE'LL GO FOR A HUNDRED BUCKS
trainval/C14bXC7zi84/50006 I'LL DO IT EVEN SLOWER
trainval/C14bXC7zi84/50007 AND ON THAT NOTE ENJOY THE REST OF THE TEDX AND HAVE A GREAT DAY
trainval/C14bXC7zi84/50008 ASK HIM TO NAME OUT ONE SUIT
trainval/C2SVEM19NHA/50001 I WAS TELLING A STORY TO MYSELF BECAUSE I WANTED TO BELIEVE IN IT
trainval/C2SVEM19NHA/50002 I WANTED MOSES TO KNOW
trainval/C2SVEM19NHA/50003 BECAUSE HE IS A HUMAN BEING
trainval/C2SVEM19NHA/50004 HUMAN BEINGS HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACCUMULATE DATA PRESERVE IT WRITE IT DOWN AND
trainval/C2SVEM19NHA/50005 USE EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50001 IN 1972 THERE WERE 300000 PEOPLE IN JAILS AND PRISONS
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50002 TODAY THERE ARE 2
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50003 WE'RE ACTUALLY PROJECTING IN ANOTHER 10 YEARS THE LEVEL OF DISENFRANCHISEMENT WILL BE AS HIGH AS IT'S BEEN SINCE PRIOR TO THE
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50004 I ACTUALLY LEARNED ABOUT THIS FROM MY GRANDMOTHER
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50005 AND MY GRANDMOTHER WAS TOUGH BUT SHE WAS ALSO LOVING
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50006 WHEN I WOULD SEE HER AS A LITTLE BOY SHE'D COME UP TO ME AND SHE'D GIVE ME THESE HUGS
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50007 MY COUSINS WOULD BE RUNNING AROUND EVERYWHERE
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50008 SHE SAID NOW YOU MAKE SURE YOU DON'T DO THAT
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50009 I SAID SURE
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50010 I SAID OKAY MAMA
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50011 WELL I ADORED MY MOM SO I SAID YES MAMA
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50012 I'LL DO THAT
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50013 YOU ALL GO AHEAD
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50014 I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY BEER
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50015 MY BROTHER SAID COME ON
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50016 WE'RE DOING THIS TODAY YOU ALWAYS DO WHAT WE DO
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50017 I HAD SOME YOUR SISTER HAD SOME
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50019 Y'ALL GO AHEAD
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50020 AND THEN MY BROTHER STARTED STARING AT ME
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50021 HE SAID WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50022 HAVE SOME BEER
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50023 THIS COUNTRY IS VERY DIFFERENT TODAY THAN IT WAS 40 YEARS AGO
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50024 WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO EMBRACE THESE CHALLENGES THESE PROBLEMS THE SUFFERING
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50025 BUT SOMEHOW WE CAN INSULATE OURSELVES FROM THIS PROBLEM
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50026 WE DON'T REALLY KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT IT
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50027 AND THAT'S A VERY SENSIBLE QUESTION
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50028 WE'RE CONSTANTLY RUNNING INTO EACH OTHER
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50029 WE'RE CONSTANTLY CREATING TENSIONS AND CONFLICTS
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50030 IT WAS FASCINATING BECAUSE ONE OF THE SCHOLARS STOOD UP AFTER THE PRESENTATION AND SAID WELL YOU KNOW IT'S DEEPLY
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50031 HE SAID WE DON'T HAVE THE DEATH PENALTY IN GERMANY
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50032 AND OF COURSE WE CAN NEVER HAVE THE DEATH PENALTY IN GERMANY
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50033 WE LOVE INNOVATION
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50034 WE LOVE CREATIVITY
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50035 VACLAV HAVEL THE GREAT CZECH LEADER TALKED ABOUT THIS
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50036 IT WILL GET TO YOU
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50037 I HAD THE GREAT PRIVILEGE WHEN I WAS A YOUNG LAWYER OF MEETING ROSA PARKS
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50038 AND THESE WOMEN WOULD GET TOGETHER AND JUST TALK
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50039 AND EVERY NOW AND THEN MS
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50040 PARKS IS COMING TO TOWN
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50041 FOR EVERY NINE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN EXECUTED WE'VE ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED ONE INNOCENT PERSON WHO'S BEEN EXONERATED AND
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50042 WE'RE GOING TO GET TOGETHER AND TALK
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50043 AND I'D SAY YES MA'AM I DO
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50044 IT WOULD BE SO ENERGIZING AND SO EMPOWERING
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50045 WE'RE TRYING TO CONFRONT BIAS AND DISCRIMINATION IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50047 YOU SHOULD ASK FOR SOME OF THAT
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50048 AND BECAUSE I WAS UP TOO LATE WASN'T THINKING REAL STRAIGHT I STARTED WORKING ON A MOTION
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50049 THERE WAS A CRAZY LINE IN THERE ABOUT HOW THERE'S NO CONDUCT IN THIS COUNTY IT'S ALL MISCONDUCT
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50050 I SAID I'M A LAWYER
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50051 HE SAID YOU'RE A LAWYER
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50052 I SAID YES SIR
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50053 AND THIS MAN CAME OVER TO ME AND HE HUGGED ME
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50054 AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU IT WAS ENERGIZING
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50055 AND AS SOON AS I WALKED INSIDE THE JUDGE SAW ME COMING IN
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50056 I SAID YES SIR
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50057 I HAD WRITTEN THESE CRAZY THINGS
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50058 AND OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE I COULD SEE THIS JANITOR PACING BACK AND FORTH
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50059 AND HE KEPT LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW AND HE COULD HEAR ALL OF THIS HOLLER
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50060 HE KEPT PACING BACK AND FORTH
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50061 HE SAID JIMMY WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THIS COURTROOM
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50062 THAT OUR VISIONS OF TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN AND ENTERTAINMENT AND CREATIVITY HAVE TO BE MARRIED WITH VISIONS
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50063 AND YET 46 PERCENT OF ALL HOMICIDE CASES DON'T RESULT IN ARREST
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50064 SO THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THAT
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50065 WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO SOMEONE WHO BELIEVED THAT
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50066 THE GREAT INCREASE IN MASS INCARCERATION IN THIS COUNTRY WASN'T REALLY IN VIOLENT CRIME CATEGORIES
trainval/c2tOp7OxyQ8/50067 IT WAS THIS MISGUIDED WAR ON DRUGS
trainval/C3DyhrDsNUA/50001 BUT JUST A REMINDER
trainval/C3DyhrDsNUA/50002 WE HAVE ABOUT 3
trainval/C3DyhrDsNUA/50003 SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT
trainval/C3DyhrDsNUA/50004 SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE LOST PARENTS PREMATURELY TO THAT CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE EPIDEMIC
trainval/C3DyhrDsNUA/50005 WE PROVIDED SOME OF THE SCIETIFIC INPUT AND FACT CHECKING AND SO FORTH AND THIS NOW HAS
trainval/c4oW6PcOUtc/50001 AS YOU CAN IMAGINE AT THIS POINT WHEN WE HAVE THESE ADVANCES IN THE GRAPHENE PRODUCTION MANY THINGS
trainval/c4oW6PcOUtc/50002 SO GRAPHENE IS BEING DISTORTED AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF IT IS THAT ELECTRONS ON
trainval/c6mhFgAjqwA/50001 AND WHEN I STARTED IN WITH THE EIGHT HOURS AND THE 10 HOURS AND THE 12 HOURS AND THE 14 HOURS AND THE 15
trainval/c6mhFgAjqwA/50002 IT'S 14 HOURS 58 MINUTES
trainval/c6mhFgAjqwA/50003 WHO CARES THE LAST TWO MINUTES
trainval/c6mhFgAjqwA/50004 AND THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS
trainval/c6mhFgAjqwA/50005 THEY WERE PREPARED
trainval/c6mhFgAjqwA/50006 AND BY THE WAY A REPORTER CALLED ME THE OTHER DAY AND HE SAID HE LOOKED ON WIKIPEDIA AND HE SAID HE SAW MY BIRTHDAY WAS AUGUST 22ND
trainval/c6mhFgAjqwA/50007 AND HE IS DOWN
trainval/c6mhFgAjqwA/50008 SO THAT WAS AT EIGHT O'CLOCK AT NIGHT
trainval/c6mhFgAjqwA/50009 SO I SWAM THROUGH THE NIGHT AND AT DAWN THEY GOT THERE AND THEY STARTED WITH PREDNISONE SHOTS
trainval/c6mhFgAjqwA/50010 AND THIS TIME I DON'T LIKE IT I DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE INTO IT BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A NON STOP
trainval/c6mhFgAjqwA/50011 IF I GET STUNG I'LL JUST GRIN AND BEAR IT
trainval/c6mhFgAjqwA/50012 I CAN FEEL PROUD
trainval/c6mhFgAjqwA/50013 AND I WANT TO LIVE EVERY DAY OF THE REST OF MY LIFE THAT WAY SWIM OR NO SWIM
trainval/C6mNITMY7e0/50001 THEY COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT
trainval/C6mNITMY7e0/50002 I'VE BEEN WORKING IN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DREW ME TO THIS SECTOR
trainval/C6mNITMY7e0/50003 CARERS ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE SACRIFICING THEIR OWN PHYSICAL FINANCIAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL
trainval/C6mNITMY7e0/50004 AND ABOVE ALL HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT THEIR VALUE TO PATIENTS OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND
trainval/C6mNITMY7e0/50005 I WANT TO GIVE YOU JUST ONE EXAMPLE FROM AUSTRALIA IN 2015
trainval/C6mNITMY7e0/50006 I AM PROUD THAT MY PERSONAL ENGAGEMENT AND ENTHUSIASM TOWARDS THIS TOPIC OF CARERS FOUND AN ECHO IN MY
trainval/C6mNITMY7e0/50007 MY COMPANY IS COMMITTED TO THIS CAUSE AND HAS DEVELOPED AN UNPRECEDENTED FRAMEWORK FOR ITS
trainval/C6mNITMY7e0/50008 THE OBJECTIVE IS TO EMPOWER CARERS TO IMPROVE THEIR OWN HEALTH AND WELL BEING AND BRING ABOUT A GREATER
trainval/C6mNITMY7e0/50009 WHAT YOU DO IS EXTREMELY PRECIOUS
trainval/C6mNITMY7e0/50010 IF CARERS AROUND THE WORLD FELT BETTER RECOGNIZED IT WOULD NOT ONLY IMPROVE THEIR OWN HEALTH AND WELL BEING AND
trainval/c73Q8oQmwzo/50001 SO OUR BODY IT GOES ON AUTOPILOT WHILE WE'RE FOLDING THE LAUNDRY OR WE'RE WALKING TO WORK
trainval/c73Q8oQmwzo/50002 THAT PART WAS GREAT
trainval/c73Q8oQmwzo/50003 AND THEY TOLD ME THE REASON THEY WERE DOING IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED THAT THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR PHONE HAD GROWN
trainval/c73Q8oQmwzo/50004 IT WAS CALLED DELETE THAT APP
trainval/c73Q8oQmwzo/50005 BUT MY MISERY HAD GOOD COMPANY
trainval/c73Q8oQmwzo/50006 THEY FELT EMPOWERED
trainval/c73Q8oQmwzo/50007 AND THERE COULD BE CONSEQUENCES
trainval/c73Q8oQmwzo/50008 RESEARCHERS AT USC HAVE FOUND THEY'RE STUDYING TEENAGERS WHO ARE ON SOCIAL MEDIA WHILE THEY'RE TALKING TO THEIR
trainval/C74amJRp730/50001 LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF SNAPCHAT
trainval/C74amJRp730/50002 IT'S PROBABLY OK
trainval/C74amJRp730/50003 AND IF YOU'RE THE FACEBOOK NEWSFEED WHETHER YOU'D WANT TO OR NOT YOU ACTUALLY BENEFIT WHEN THERE'S OUTRAGE
trainval/C74amJRp730/50004 IT'S ONLY ACCOUNTABLE TO MAXIMIZING ATTENTION
trainval/C74amJRp730/50005 THE FIRST IS WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE PERSUADABLE
trainval/C74amJRp730/50006 IN OTHER WORDS IT'S SCHEDULING A LITTLE TIMELINE OF THINGS YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO ON THE SCREEN
trainval/C74amJRp730/50007 SO LET ME GIVE YOU A CONCRETE EXAMPLE
trainval/C74amJRp730/50008 WHAT WOULD BE THE PERFECT TIMELINE THAT MIGHT INCLUDE SOMETHING LATER WOULD BE TIME WELL SPENT FOR YOU HERE AT TED IN YOUR LAST DAY HERE
trainval/C74amJRp730/50009 AND SO WHAT DO YOU DO IN THAT MOMENT
trainval/C74amJRp730/50011 YOU OPEN UP FACEBOOK
trainval/C74amJRp730/50012 I STUDIED AT A LAB CALLED THE PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY LAB AT STANFORD THAT TAUGHT STUDENTS HOW TO RECOGNIZE EXACTLY THESE TECHNIQUES
trainval/C74amJRp730/50013 IT'S THE CLASSIC RACE TO THE BOTTOM WHEN YOU HAVE TO GET ATTENTION AND IT'S SO TENSE
trainval/C74amJRp730/50014 THERE'S CONFERENCES AND WORKSHOPS THAT TEACH PEOPLE ALL THESE COVERT WAYS OF GETTING PEOPLE'S ATTENTION AND ORCHESTRATING
trainval/C8OqQ2lmsEo/50001 SO WE CAME UP WITH THE IDEA TO START A POP UP PLACE
trainval/C8OqQ2lmsEo/50002 50 THREE COURSES OR FOR 27
trainval/C8pNGaSIFoU/50001 AND EACH AND EVERYONE OF US IS LIVING IT TODAY
trainval/C8pNGaSIFoU/50002 WHAT IS THE AMERICAN DREAM
trainval/C8pNGaSIFoU/50003 BUT NOT JUST A HOME
trainval/C8QCStOtqus/50001 I'M JUST GOING TO SEE A BREAST SURGEON
trainval/C8QCStOtqus/50002 I MEAN HE'S GOT TO KNOW MORE
trainval/C8QCStOtqus/50003 YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/C8QCStOtqus/50004 YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/C8QCStOtqus/50005 I KNOW WHAT'S INSIDE ME I KNOW WHEN SOMETHING'S WRONG
trainval/C8QCStOtqus/50006 I FOUND OUT THAT I AM ONE OF 45 MILLION WOMEN WHO HAVE WHAT'S CALLED
trainval/C8QCStOtqus/50007 IT'S IN BETWEEN YOUR BREASTS
trainval/C8QCStOtqus/50008 ITS OK YOU JUST NEED TO KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THEM
trainval/C8QCStOtqus/50009 IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY
trainval/C8QCStOtqus/50010 PAULA GORDON'S STUDY
trainval/C8QCStOtqus/50011 AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAID
trainval/C8QCStOtqus/50012 MAYBE IF MY CANCER HAD BEEN FOUND A YEAR BEFORE WHEN IT WAS SMALLER AND EASY TO
trainval/c8re1U9rCo4/50001 AND I'M GOING TO ONLY TALK ABOUT THE MASS
trainval/c8re1U9rCo4/50002 SO IN THAT SENSE IT'S A VERY SIMPLE OBJECT
trainval/c8re1U9rCo4/50003 AT THAT POINT GRAVITY WINS
trainval/c8re1U9rCo4/50004 GRAVITY WINS OVER ALL OTHER KNOWN FORCES
trainval/c8re1U9rCo4/50005 AND THEN IT'S A BLACK HOLE
trainval/c8re1U9rCo4/50006 IT DEPENDS ONLY ON THE MASS OF THE OBJECT
trainval/c8re1U9rCo4/50007 BIGGER OBJECTS HAVE BIGGER SCHWARZSCHILD RADII
trainval/c8re1U9rCo4/50008 SO WHAT PEOPLE HAVE THOUGHT IS THAT PERHAPS THERE ARE SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLES WHICH
trainval/c8re1U9rCo4/50009 IT'S THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL THAT MAKES THESE THINGS ORBIT
trainval/c8re1U9rCo4/50010 AND THAT BUYS US ABOUT A FACTOR OF 20
trainval/c8re1U9rCo4/50011 SO IF I KNOW HOW FAST IT GOES AROUND I KNOW THE MASS
trainval/c8re1U9rCo4/50012 AND IF I KNOW THE SCALE OF THE ORBIT I KNOW THE RADIUS
trainval/c8re1U9rCo4/50013 AND IN FACT IT'S THE BEST EVIDENCE WE HAVE TO DATE FOR NOT ONLY EXISTENCE OF A SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLE AT THE CENTER OF OUR OWN GALAXY BUT
trainval/c8re1U9rCo4/50014 SO WHAT I WANT TO TELL YOU VERY BRIEFLY IS A FEW EXAMPLES OF THE EXCITEMENT OF WHAT WE CAN DO TODAY AT THE
trainval/c8re1U9rCo4/50015 BECAUSE I WANT TO SHOW THERE IS A MASS INSIDE AS SMALL A REGION AS POSSIBLE
trainval/c8re1U9rCo4/50016 SO YOU SHOULDN'T SEE YOUNG STARS
trainval/c8re1U9rCo4/50017 AND IN FACT TODAY THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THIS MYSTERY OF HOW DO YOU GET HOW DO YOU RESOLVE THIS CONTRADICTION
trainval/c8WMMSPUOj0/50001 SO IN THIS WAY A CLOSED LOOP CARBON CYCLE IS CREATED
trainval/c8WMMSPUOj0/50002 ON A LONG SPACE JOURNEY YOU SIMPLY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PICK UP ANY CARBON ALONG THE WAY SO YOU'D HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
trainval/c8WMMSPUOj0/50003 WE HAVEN'T YET GONE TO MARS
trainval/c8WMMSPUOj0/50004 WE HAVEN'T YET GONE TO ANOTHER PLANET
trainval/c8WMMSPUOj0/50005 AND WE MADE AN OIL THAT'S SIMILAR TO PALM OIL
trainval/c8WMMSPUOj0/50006 WE BEGAN WORKING WITH MANUFACTURERS TO SCALE UP THIS TECHNOLOGY AND WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THEM
trainval/c8WMMSPUOj0/50007 SO YOU AND I ARE DIRECT BENEFICIARIES OF REMOVED RAINFORESTS
trainval/C8zY0oAdQrs/50001 I SAID LOOK I HAVE A NEW VIDEO CAMERA
trainval/C8zY0oAdQrs/50002 DID YOU HAVE A BREAK UP
trainval/C8zY0oAdQrs/50003 THEY TOLD ME WHAT WAS HAPPENING OUT IN THE WORLD WITH SIX WORDS IDEAS I'D NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT
trainval/C9kPFCw2u3M/50004 EVERY TWO MINUTES AN AMERICAN IS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED
trainval/C9kPFCw2u3M/50006 I WAS RAISED IN A STORY WHERE CAUTION WAS USELESS LB AMP TL
trainval/C9mareySEAM/50001 SHE HAD TO STAY AT HOME
trainval/C9mareySEAM/50002 SHE COULDN'T GO OUTSIDE
trainval/C9mareySEAM/50003 EVEN THOUGH IT WAS NIGHT AND EVERYONE WAS TRYING TO CALM US DOWN WE COULDN'T STOP LAUGHING
trainval/C9mareySEAM/50004 IT TOOK US 13 DAYS TO REACH THE CZECH REPUBLIC
trainval/cAGFKYNrQgY/50001 SO AS YOU CAN GUESS MY MOTHER TONGUE IS FRENCH
trainval/cAGFKYNrQgY/50002 AND AS MY IMAGE IS ALREADY INSIDE THE PAPER I JUST HAVE TO
trainval/CbS6PPBJJB8/50001 PEOPLE IN THE SATELLITE ROOM ARE STARTING TO MOVE IN NOW
trainval/CbS6PPBJJB8/50002 I'LL GET MY SLEEVE BACK
trainval/CbS6PPBJJB8/50003 I HOLD THE KNIFE IN MY HAND
trainval/CbS6PPBJJB8/50004 IN A MOMENT WHEN MY HAND MOVES FROM FACING YOU TO BEING AWAY FROM YOU THIS FINGER RIGHT HERE MY INDEX FINGER IS
trainval/CbS6PPBJJB8/50005 AND WE COULD TALK ABOUT WHY THIS IS DECEPTIVE WHY YOU DON'T NOTICE THERE ARE ONLY THREE FINGERS DOWN HERE BECAUSE
trainval/CbS6PPBJJB8/50006 IT GROUPS THEM
trainval/CbS6PPBJJB8/50007 AND THEN I OPEN MY HAND UP
trainval/CbS6PPBJJB8/50008 I TAKE THIS HAND AWAY
trainval/CbS6PPBJJB8/50009 YOU GIVE THE KNIFE OUT
trainval/CbS6PPBJJB8/50010 IT'S A REALLY THIS GRAPH WELL I'LL SHOW IT TO YOU SOME OTHER TIME WHEN WE HAVE SLIDES
trainval/CbS6PPBJJB8/50011 I'LL DO IT FOR YOU AND THEN I'LL EXPLAIN IT
trainval/CbS6PPBJJB8/50012 BUT YOU CAN'T COUNT MY FINGERS RIGHT NOW CAN YOU
trainval/cbSts8fUhB8/50001 NO ONE KNOWS WHO OR WHAT HE IS
trainval/cbSts8fUhB8/50002 HE'S ALMOST LIKE THE BANKSY OF THE INTERNET
trainval/cbSts8fUhB8/50003 SO IN ONE LEVEL IT WENT FROM SOMETHING LIKE 13 DOLLARS TO 266 LITERALLY IN THE SPACE OF FOUR MONTHS AND THEN CRASHED AND
trainval/cbSts8fUhB8/50004 AND IT'S CURRENTLY AROUND THAT KIND OF 110 DOLLAR MARK IN VALUE
trainval/cbSts8fUhB8/50005 AND THAT'S NOT SURPRISING IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE BASKET CASE THAT IS THE E
trainval/cbSts8fUhB8/50006 SO WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IN THE DIGITAL AGE IS THAT WE CAN QUANTIFY VALUE IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS AND DO IT MORE EASILY
trainval/cbSts8fUhB8/50007 YOU THINK ABOUT REWARDS SCHEMES AIR MILES
trainval/cbSts8fUhB8/50008 SO THAT'S A SORT OF STARBUCKS CURRENCY STAYING WITHIN ITS ECOSYSTEM
trainval/cbSts8fUhB8/50009 IT'S 50 PERCENT ABOVE THE CATEGORY AVERAGE
trainval/cbSts8fUhB8/50010 IT'S INFUSED WITH A VERY COMPLEX COCKTAIL OF CHEMICALS SO IT SMELLS VERY LUXURIOUS AND VERY DISTINCTIVE AND
trainval/cbSts8fUhB8/50011 WHEN THEY SPOT TIDE THERE'S A SHORTCUT
trainval/cbSts8fUhB8/50012 THEY SAY THAT IS TRUST
trainval/cbSts8fUhB8/50014 SO THAT BRINGS ME BACK TO THE CONNECTION WITH SWEAT
trainval/cbSts8fUhB8/50015 YOU'VE BOUGHT INTO IT
trainval/cbSts8fUhB8/50016 THEY'RE NOT ADVERTISING LOUD MESSAGES AT YOU AND THAT'S WHERE ADVERTISING HAS STARTED TO SHIFT NOW IS INTO THINGS LIKE SERVICES TOOLS
trainval/cbSts8fUhB8/50017 IS TECHNOLOGY MAKING PAPER MONEY FEEL OUTMODED
trainval/cbSts8fUhB8/50018 ARE WE DECOUPLING MONEY FROM THE GOVERNMENT
trainval/cbSts8fUhB8/50019 AND YOU CAN'T COME INTO THIS
trainval/cbSts8fUhB8/50020 THIS IS PURELY FOR THE COMMUNITY THAT ARE SWEATING USING NIKE PRODUCTS
trainval/cbSts8fUhB8/50021 YOU CAN'T BUY STUFF WITH PESOS
trainval/CBSU7vJn0us/50001 HOW CAN MEDIA EARN MONEY TO SURVIVE
trainval/CBSU7vJn0us/50002 THE ANSWER IS
trainval/CBSU7vJn0us/50003 THERE IS NOT ONE SINGLE ANSWER
trainval/cC0KxNeLp1E/50001 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
trainval/cC0KxNeLp1E/50002 I SET UP THE TYPE I PRINTED IT OUT ON AN EPSON PRINTER WITH WATER SOLUBLE INK TAPED IT TO
trainval/Cd0JH1AreDw/50001 END OF STORY
trainval/Cd0JH1AreDw/50002 THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS
trainval/Cd0JH1AreDw/50003 AND I BELIEVE THE WAY WE MAKE CIVICS SEXY AGAIN IS TO MAKE EXPLICITLY ABOUT THE TEACHING OF
trainval/Cd0JH1AreDw/50004 ALL OF THESE FORM OF POWER ARE AT PLAY
trainval/CDdpQSLr7YE/50001 THEY'RE SEPARATED BY DISTANCES THAT ARE AROUND THE SIZE OF A BIOMOLECULE
trainval/CDdpQSLr7YE/50002 AND THIS IS WHERE WE'RE REALLY LUCKY
trainval/CDdpQSLr7YE/50003 WE KNEW HOW TO BUILD ROCKETS
trainval/cdpIwjTtLlg/50001 WE PROMISE YOU THAT
trainval/CdxVbUjaSpY/50001 PEOPLE HAVE TO EAT
trainval/CdxVbUjaSpY/50002 WELL GUESS WHAT
trainval/CdxVbUjaSpY/50003 WELL I FIND PARENTS OUT ON THE FRONT LINES VERY AWARE THEIR CHILDREN
trainval/CdxVbUjaSpY/50004 AND THE FOOD BANKS ARE GROWING
trainval/CdxVbUjaSpY/50005 THE SHOPKEEPERS ARE HIRING MORE PEOPLE
trainval/CdxVbUjaSpY/50006 WE'LL PICK IT UP
trainval/CdxVbUjaSpY/50007 WE'LL MAKE SURE IT'S STORED PROPERLY
trainval/CdxVbUjaSpY/50008 NO MORE ARE WE GOING TO ACCEPT THIS
trainval/ce31WjiVcY0/50001 IF YOU THINK THEY'RE FIGHTING YOU'RE A BIT MORE OF A NASTY AGGRESSIVE PERSON
trainval/ce31WjiVcY0/50004 QUITE A FEW PEOPLE THERE
trainval/ce31WjiVcY0/50006 WHAT IS TRUE THAT AMBIDEXTROUS PEOPLE OR PEOPLE WHO USE BOTH HANDS FOR DIFFERENT TASKS ARE MORE
trainval/ce31WjiVcY0/50007 AND THEY PLAYED THE PEOPLE THE MUSIC OR THE STORIES
trainval/ce31WjiVcY0/50008 THE PEOPLE WHO PREFERRED MOZART MUSIC TO THE STORIES GOT A BIGGER I
trainval/ce31WjiVcY0/50009 BOOST FROM THE MOZART THAN THE STORIES BUT THE PEOPLE WHO PREFERRED THE STORIES TO THE MOZART MUSIC GOT A BIGGER I
trainval/ce31WjiVcY0/50010 A FAMOUS STUDY SURVEYED PEOPLE FROM 37 DIFFERENT CULTURES ACROSS THE GLOBE FROM AMERICANS TO ZULUS ON WHAT THEY
trainval/ce31WjiVcY0/50011 AND ONE THING YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT DOING IS PUNISHING PEOPLE FOR THEIR MISSES AND SEEING IF THAT IMPROVES THEM
trainval/ce31WjiVcY0/50012 FIRSTLY AND MOST CRUCIALLY THE LAB COAT WASN'T WHITE IT WAS IN FACT GREY
trainval/CE3tL9MMk3U/50001 A FEW YEARS AGO OUR RESEARCH TEAM FOUND THAT 30 OF WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES REPORTED
trainval/CE3tL9MMk3U/50002 I ALSO THINK THAT THE WAY WE'RE EXPECTING IT TO CHANGE IS BROKEN
trainval/CE3tL9MMk3U/50003 IF WE SIT AROUND WAITING FOR POLITICIANS AND SCHOOL SYSTEMS AND PARENTS TO CHANGE THIS
trainval/CE3tL9MMk3U/50004 BUT I ALSO HAVE A PERSONAL STAKE IN THIS
trainval/CEN4XNth61o/50001 THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE MEDIA'S SPACE EXPANDS
trainval/CEN4XNth61o/50002 THEY NEEDED OPENNESS
trainval/CEN4XNth61o/50003 BUT THE OTHER THING THEY NEEDED WAS SPEED
trainval/cF2dhWWUyQ4/50001 I'VE LISTENED TO IT EVERY SINGLE NIGHT FOR 15 YEARS AND I KNOW EVERY EPISODE INSIDE OUT
trainval/cF2dhWWUyQ4/50002 PEOPLE ASSUME THAT HIGH FUNCTIONING MEANS THAT YOUR AUTISM IS MILD WHEN IN FACT HIGH FUNCTIONING
trainval/cF2dhWWUyQ4/50003 AND THERE'S THIS JOKE THAT WHY DON'T THEY JUST MAKE 10 LOUDER
trainval/cF2dhWWUyQ4/50004 I LEARNT TO KEEP IT INSIDE ME UNTIL I WAS IN MY ROOM ON MY OWN WHERE I COULD ROCK AND I COULD JUMP AND I COULD FLAP MY
trainval/cF2dhWWUyQ4/50005 I SPENT TEN YEARS IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM BOUNCING FROM ONE INPATIENT STAY TO ANOTHER
trainval/cF2dhWWUyQ4/50006 I WITHDREW FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM
trainval/cF2dhWWUyQ4/50007 AND THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DEATH IS SUICIDE
trainval/cf3zxHuSM2Y/50001 THE PC VIRUS PROBLEM IS 25 YEARS OLD NOW
trainval/cf3zxHuSM2Y/50002 AND THIS REALLY IS SOMETHING WHICH CREATES COMPLETELY NEW PROBLEMS FOR US
trainval/cf3zxHuSM2Y/50003 JAIN AND THAT BANK ACCOUNT HAD 14
trainval/cf3zxHuSM2Y/50004 9 MILLION U
trainval/cf3zxHuSM2Y/50005 AND EVEN IF WE ARE ABLE TO FIND ONLINE CRIMINALS QUITE OFTEN THERE IS NO OUTCOME
trainval/cf3zxHuSM2Y/50007 FOR EXAMPLE THE ELEVATORS IN THIS BUILDING MOST LIKELY ARE CONTROLLED BY ONE OF THESE
trainval/cf3zxHuSM2Y/50008 EVERYTHING IS RELIANT ON THESE COMPUTERS WORKING
trainval/CFADnhYKDHg/50001 I STARTED OFF OK
trainval/CFADnhYKDHg/50002 AND I WAS RIGHT
trainval/CFADnhYKDHg/50003 UP UNTIL THAT TIME I'D REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT ONLINE EDUCATION IN TERMS OF
trainval/CFADnhYKDHg/50004 WE ARE GOING YO USE THIS THING CALLED THE ONLINE BULLETIN BOARD FOR DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE GOING TO GO ON
trainval/CFADnhYKDHg/50005 YOU ARE GOING TO CALL ON MAYBE ONE OR TWO OF THEM WHOEVER YOU MAY NOTICE
trainval/CFADnhYKDHg/50006 AND THEN THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE TO ARTICULATE THEIR ANSWER ORALLY
trainval/CFADnhYKDHg/50007 FINALLY BECAUSE IT'S ONLINE IT'S PRESERVED AND STUDENTS CAN USE THOSE HISTORIC DISCUSSIONS TO
trainval/CFADnhYKDHg/50008 I WAS SOLD AND FROM GRAD SCHOOL ON I DEDICATED ALMOST ALL MY ENERGY TO
trainval/CFADnhYKDHg/50009 SO LET'S FAST FORWARD A DECADE
trainval/CFADnhYKDHg/50010 I'VE BEEN DOING THIS AT THE UNIVERSITY FOR QUITE SOME TIME
trainval/CFADnhYKDHg/50011 LET ME BE THE GUINEA PIG AND SHOW YOU HOW IT'S DONE RIGHT
trainval/CFADnhYKDHg/50012 AND I FELT REALLY BAD ABOUT IT
trainval/CFADnhYKDHg/50013 SO I CREATED SOME NEW IN CLASS ACTIVITIES
trainval/CFADnhYKDHg/50014 YOU GUYS PROBABLY ALL USE AN ONLINE CALENDAR TO HELP YOU GET TO PHYSICAL
trainval/CFADnhYKDHg/50015 SO WHILE I'M TEACHING CLASSES NOWADAYS MY LMS WILL NOTIFY ME WHEN THERE ARE NEW ASSIGNMENTS I NEED TO GRADE
trainval/CFADnhYKDHg/50016 THAT IS ALL
trainval/CfmNXPMjChs/50001 THAT'S JUST WHAT I HAD OF LAYING AROUND AND I WANT TO MAKE USE OF IT
trainval/CfmNXPMjChs/50002 SO THROUGHOUT LEARNING IT WAS A CHALLENGE
trainval/CfmNXPMjChs/50003 IF YOU TIMES THAT BY FIVE YOU GET INDIVIDUAL FINGER CONTROL OF A WHOLE HAND
trainval/CfmNXPMjChs/50004 SO I REALLY LOOKED AROUND AND TRIED TO USE MY RESOURCES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
trainval/CfmNXPMjChs/50005 I WAS 16 AT THE TIME
trainval/CfmNXPMjChs/50006 I DIDN'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY TO PUT INTO THIS
trainval/CfmNXPMjChs/50008 FROM THERE I ENTERED THIS INTO THE SCIENCE FAIR IN COLORADO AND AT THE STATE SCIENCE FAIR
trainval/CfmNXPMjChs/50009 THE MAIN CONTROL SYSTEM FOR THE NEWER ADVANCED ONES ARE ALL NEURAL IMPLANTS WHICH IS AN OPEN
trainval/CfmNXPMjChs/50010 I HAVE A NEW DESIGN WHERE ALL THE MOTORS WERE CONCEALED WITHIN THE PALM OF THE HAND STILL THE SAME SIZE AND I GET OVER TWICE THE
trainval/cfNaMMItHAI/50001 THAT'S ABOUT THE SAME POPULATION AS THE ENTIRE STATE OF FLORIDA
trainval/cfNaMMItHAI/50002 SHE EXPLAINED IN THE BACK ROOM ON THE DIRT FLOOR WERE SEVEN CHILDREN
trainval/cfNaMMItHAI/50003 THEY WERE COMPLETELY FILTHY AND STARVING
trainval/cfNaMMItHAI/50004 ONE OF THEM WAS THE SKINNIEST HUMAN BEING SO I'VE EVER SEEN
trainval/CfqO1U6lfDs/50001 IT'S ACTUALLY THE EXACT OPPOSITE
trainval/CfqO1U6lfDs/50002 AND I'VE BEEN WRITING ABOUT THESE CREATURES EVER SINCE
trainval/CfqO1U6lfDs/50003 FEW TOPICS IN BIOLOGY ENTHRALL ME MORE
trainval/CfqO1U6lfDs/50004 THIS CATERPILLAR WAS ATTACKED BY A PARASITIC WASP WHICH LAID EGGS INSIDE IT
trainval/CfqO1U6lfDs/50005 THEY'RE EASY TO OVERLOOK BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY AREN'T IMPORTANT
trainval/CfqO1U6lfDs/50006 IT DOESN'T KILL THE ROACH NOR DOES IT SEDATE IT
trainval/CfqO1U6lfDs/50007 JUST LIKE THE CRICKET WAS AN EXTENSION OF THE GORDIAN WORM
trainval/CfqO1U6lfDs/50009 TOXO GETS TO HAVE SEX
trainval/CfqO1U6lfDs/50010 HOW DOES THE PARASITE CONTROL ITS HOST IN THIS WAY
trainval/cfR6tiSWSAM/50002 HOW DO WE DEVELOP THESE KINDS OF IDEAS
trainval/cfR6tiSWSAM/50003 THIS IS WHERE SCHOOL COMES IN
trainval/cfR6tiSWSAM/50004 THESE ARE ALL THE TOOLS WE NEED
trainval/cfR6tiSWSAM/50005 IT'S A VERY AMBITIOUS GOAL BUT WE TRULY BELIEVE WE CAN DO IT
trainval/cfR6tiSWSAM/50006 THIS IS LAST YEAR IN CHINA
trainval/cfR6tiSWSAM/50007 WE WON A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS IN THE DARPA URBAN CHALLENGE
trainval/cfR6tiSWSAM/50008 WE ALSO HAVE THE WORLD'S VERY FIRST VEHICLE THAT CAN BE DRIVEN BY THE BLIND
trainval/cfR6tiSWSAM/50009 WE CALL IT THE BLIND DRIVER CHALLENGE VERY EXCITING
trainval/cfR6tiSWSAM/50010 NOW THIS ROBOT IS CURRENTLY OUR STAR ROBOT
trainval/cfR6tiSWSAM/50011 AND THEY ASSEMBLE AND THEY FORM THESE KINDS OF MECHANISMS
trainval/cfR6tiSWSAM/50012 SO RIGHT NEXT TO MY BED I KEEP A NOTEBOOK A JOURNAL WITH A SPECIAL PEN THAT HAS AN LED LIGHT ON IT BECAUSE I
trainval/cfR6tiSWSAM/50013 SO I NEED TO DECIPHER WHAT I WROTE
trainval/cfR6tiSWSAM/50014 I DIRECTLY RUN TO MY HOME OFFICE SIT AT MY COMPUTER I TYPE IN THE IDEAS I SKETCH THINGS OUT AND I KEEP A DATABASE OF
trainval/cfR6tiSWSAM/50015 BUT JUST A SPARK OF IMAGINATION IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH
trainval/CFtsHf1lVI4/50002 THE OTHER RELATIONSHIP THAT I'VE NOTICED IS SO TIGHT IS THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO EACH OTHER
trainval/CFtsHf1lVI4/50003 THE WOMAN THAT NEEDS TO GO TO GET THE WATER WILL TAKE HER BABY AND PASS IT TO ANOTHER WOMAN
trainval/CFtsHf1lVI4/50004 THE MONKS STARTED CHANTING AND BEATING THEIR DRUMS
trainval/CFtsHf1lVI4/50005 SO I SAID WELL HOW DID YOU BECOME THE MEDIUM
trainval/CFtsHf1lVI4/50006 HOW DID YOU GET THIS JOB
trainval/CFtsHf1lVI4/50007 AND THIS IS THE WAY I'VE GOT TO FOCUS THAT IN TOTAL DARKNESS
trainval/CFtsHf1lVI4/50008 SHE HAD THE VERY SAME STORY AS THE MEDIUM OF THE DALAI LAMA
trainval/CFtsHf1lVI4/50009 I WANTED TO FIND SOMEBODY IN THAT PROCESS OF INITIATION
trainval/CFtsHf1lVI4/50010 WHEN I GOT THERE I FOUND
trainval/CFtsHf1lVI4/50011 HOW DID YOU GET INTO THIS
trainval/CFtsHf1lVI4/50012 WHAT DO YOU DO FOR YOUR TRIBE
trainval/CFtsHf1lVI4/50013 MY SPIRITS ARE TELLING ME I HAVE TO DO IT
trainval/CFtsHf1lVI4/50014 AND I THOUGHT WELL THIS IS KIND OF STRANGE
trainval/CFtsHf1lVI4/50015 I WAS TOTALLY FREAKED OUT
trainval/CFtsHf1lVI4/50016 THEY EXPAND THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS
trainval/CFtsHf1lVI4/50017 IT'S VERY RIGOROUS
trainval/CFtsHf1lVI4/50018 I DID ONE JUST TO SEE WHAT IT WAS ABOUT
trainval/CFtsHf1lVI4/50019 SO THE ONE AVENUE THAT HE COULD HAVE GOTTEN RELIEF FROM CUT HIM OFF BECAUSE OF THE STIGMA OF HIS
trainval/CFtsHf1lVI4/50020 SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT BEFORE THE AGE OF 24
trainval/CFtsHf1lVI4/50021 NOT ONLY THAT THEY HAVE AN OUTLET FOR THEIR TALENTS
trainval/CFtsHf1lVI4/50022 SHE DID IT A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO
trainval/CFtsHf1lVI4/50023 THIS IS A YOUNG WOMAN WHEN SHE WENT TO COLLEGE SHE STARTED HEARING VOICES
trainval/CFtsHf1lVI4/50024 SHE WENT TO SEE THE PSYCHIATRIST
trainval/CFtsHf1lVI4/50025 WE HUMAN BEINGS TEND TO EXPERIENCE OURSELVES AS SOMETHING SEPARATE FROM THE WHOLE WE CALL THE
trainval/CGksAjzI0go/50001 AND THEN AS NOW IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE OF BALLS AND PUNTS BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE MANY OF WHOM
trainval/CGksAjzI0go/50002 AND I SPENT QUITE A LOT OF TIME WITH THEM RATHER THAN IN PUNTS
trainval/CGksAjzI0go/50003 AND EVER SINCE THEN I'VE WONDERED WHY IT IS THAT CAPITALISM IS SO AMAZINGLY EFFICIENT AT SOME THINGS BUT SO
trainval/CGksAjzI0go/50004 THERE WILL BE A MILLION UNEMPLOYED YOUNG PEOPLE HERE BY THE END OF THE YEAR THOUSANDS LOSING THEIR JOBS
trainval/CGksAjzI0go/50005 AND I'M HERE TO HELP
trainval/CGksAjzI0go/50006 BUT NOW A FEW MONTHS ON HOWEVER GOOD POLITICIANS ARE AT SWALLOWING FROGS WITHOUT PULLING A FACE AS SOMEONE ONCE PUT IT
trainval/CGksAjzI0go/50007 AND EVERYWHERE AS PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THE UNPRECEDENTED SUMS WHICH ARE BEING SPENT OF OUR MONEY AND OUR CHILDREN'S MONEY
trainval/CGksAjzI0go/50008 AND I THINK MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE ALSO ASKING WHY BOOST CONSUMPTION RATHER THAN CHANGE WHAT WE CONSUME
trainval/CGksAjzI0go/50009 IT WON'T BE THE ONES LINING UP FOR HANDOUTS LIKE CARS AND AEROSPACE AND
trainval/CGksAjzI0go/50010 SOME OF THE IDEAS ARE STRANGE
trainval/CGksAjzI0go/50011 EDUCATION SIX SEVEN EIGHT PERCENT OF THE ECONOMY AND GROWING
trainval/CGksAjzI0go/50012 AND SOME ARE QUITE STRUCTURAL LIKE SOCIAL IMPACT BONDS WHERE YOU RAISE MONEY TO INVEST IN DIVERTING
trainval/CGksAjzI0go/50013 NOW THE IDEA THAT ALL OF THIS REPRESENTS I THINK IS RAPIDLY BECOMING A COMMON SENSE AND PART OF
trainval/CGksAjzI0go/50014 AND JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO PRESIDENT OBAMA LAUNCHED THE OFFICE OF SOCIAL INNOVATION IN THE WHITE HOUSE
trainval/CGksAjzI0go/50015 PERHAPS WE'D ACHIEVE SIMILAR PRODUCTIVITY GAINS IN SOCIETY TO THOSE WE'VE HAD IN THE
trainval/CGksAjzI0go/50016 I THINK WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT THIS WHOLE MOVEMENT WHICH IS GROWING FROM THE MARGINS REMAINS QUITE SMALL
trainval/CGksAjzI0go/50017 IT'S ALREADY IMMERSED IN SOCIAL NETWORKS
trainval/CGksAjzI0go/50018 IN RECENT YEARS A LOT OF INTELLIGENT PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT CAPITALISM HAD BASICALLY WON
trainval/CGksAjzI0go/50019 HISTORY WAS OVER AND SOCIETY WOULD INEVITABLY HAVE TO TAKE SECOND PLACE
trainval/CGksAjzI0go/50020 WE WERE NATURALLY DEFERENTIAL
trainval/CGksAjzI0go/50021 THAN BEING EXPLOITED BY MULTINATIONAL CAPITALISM IS NOT BEING EXPLOITED BY MULTINATIONAL CAPITALISM
trainval/CGksAjzI0go/50022 I'M NOT SUGGESTING THE CROWDS ARE ABOUT TO STORM THE BARRICADES AND STRING UP EVERY INVESTMENT BANKER FROM THE NEAREST
trainval/cgxZ4H3gJ8c/50001 BUT IT GOT MY ATTENTION AND SO I DID SOME RESEARCH
trainval/cgxZ4H3gJ8c/50002 WELL THE DAY OF THE ECLIPSE FOUND US AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE OUT BEHIND THE HYATT REGENCY ON THE BEACH
trainval/cgxZ4H3gJ8c/50003 I'M A SCIENCE WRITER
trainval/cgxZ4H3gJ8c/50004 I MEAN THE DAY REMAINED BRIGHT
trainval/cgxZ4H3gJ8c/50005 UNFORTUNATELY FEW AMERICANS HAVE SEEN ONE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN 38 YEARS SINCE ONE LAST TOUCHED THE
trainval/cgxZ4H3gJ8c/50006 I DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD
trainval/cgxZ4H3gJ8c/50007 YOU MIGHT CHASE SOMETHING ELSE
trainval/Chfoo9NBEow/50001 THE SECOND IS
trainval/Chfoo9NBEow/50002 SO LET'S TALK ABOUT MAKING SIMULATOR REALITIES BY HUMANS
trainval/Chfoo9NBEow/50003 SO CAN WE TAKE A REAL BRAIN AND MAKE IT INTO A VIRTUAL MIND
trainval/Chfoo9NBEow/50004 BUT ROUGHLY A THOUSAND TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE WHO
trainval/Chfoo9NBEow/50005 BUT THE10 YOU KNOW THE 10 PEOPLE ARE FREAKED OUT
trainval/CHh6hWo1AFE/50001 WHEN DO YOU SEE PEOPLE
trainval/CHh6hWo1AFE/50002 WHY WOULD YOU VOTE FOR SOMEBODY YOU HAVEN'T SEEN SOMEBODY YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO KNOW
trainval/CHh6hWo1AFE/50003 HOW DO WE GET TO KNOW THESE PEOPLE HOW DO WE GET TO SEE THEM
trainval/CHh6hWo1AFE/50004 HOW MANY OF YOU BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE YOU VOTED FOR DURING THE DEBATES AT SOME POINT
trainval/CHh6hWo1AFE/50005 MAYBE THERE'S A DIFFERENT WAY TO DO THAT
trainval/CHh6hWo1AFE/50006 I DID SOME RESEARCH
trainval/CHh6hWo1AFE/50007 IT TURNS OUT THE COMMISSION IS RUN AS A JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN THE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC PARTIES
trainval/CHh6hWo1AFE/50008 PEOPLE CAN VOTE FOR WHOEVER THEY WANT
trainval/CHh6hWo1AFE/50009 SO WHEN THEY ASK YOU WHO YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR WHAT THEY'RE REALLY ASKING IS WHO DO YOU WANT TO SEE AND WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THE SHOW IS RUN
trainval/CHh6hWo1AFE/50010 IT WOULD JUST THROW AWAY MY VOTE
trainval/CHh6hWo1AFE/50011 PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW HOW TO VOTE FOR A BILL
trainval/CHh6hWo1AFE/50012 THEY WANT TO FIND OUT THEY ASK PEOPLE THAT'S FINE YOU SHOULD GIVE THE CORRECT ANSWER THEN
trainval/CHh6hWo1AFE/50013 BUT IN THE BUILDUP TO AN ELECTION WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT YOU'RE GETTING CALLED ON THE PHONE AND BEING ASKED TO GIVE AWAY
trainval/CHh6hWo1AFE/50014 REMEMBER THE UPROAR WHEN FACEBOOK STARTING MESSING WITH THEIR PRIVACY SETTINGS
trainval/CHh6hWo1AFE/50015 POLITICIANS CAN DO THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE FAITH THAT THE POLLS ARE ACCURATE
trainval/CHh6hWo1AFE/50016 IF THE POLLS TELL THEM THE RIGHT LIE THEN ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS ALWAYS GIVE THE RIGHT LIE
trainval/CHh6hWo1AFE/50017 IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT A POLITICIAN'S STANCE ON A POSITION MAKE THE POLLS INACCURATE AND YOU'LL FIND
trainval/CHh6hWo1AFE/50018 SO TO DRAW IT ALL BACK WHAT I'M ASKING YOU TO DO OVERALL IS TO THINK ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES THAT YOUR ANSWERS HAVE
trainval/Chr3rQ6Vpcw/50001 WHAT IS A MEMORY
trainval/cHSQGnhdSi4/50001 WE HAD NO ESTABLISHED LABEL LIKE ROGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN OR A SUCCESSFUL MOVIE OR A NOVEL
trainval/CHxhjDPKfbY/50001 AND MAYBE YOU HAD THIS SENSE OF THAT PEACE
trainval/CHxhjDPKfbY/50002 WOULDN'T IT BE NICE BY THE WAY IF YOU COULD EXPERIENCE THAT KIND OF PEACE THAT KIND OF PRODUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT WITHOUT HAVING THE DANGER OR STRESS
trainval/CHxhjDPKfbY/50003 IT'S ONLY ON YOUR MIND BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE'S STILL SOME THINKING OR SOME DECISIONS ABOUT THAT YOU HAVEN'T MADE OR YOU HAVEN'T PARKED THE RESULTS
trainval/CHxhjDPKfbY/50004 IT'S NOT ABOUT A NEW ELEGANT PLANNER
trainval/CHxhjDPKfbY/50005 IT'S NOT ABOUT A NEW PIECE OF SOFTWARE
trainval/CHxhjDPKfbY/50006 JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH ONLY HAD 24 HOURS
trainval/CHxhjDPKfbY/50007 HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO BE INSPIRED
trainval/CHxhjDPKfbY/50008 HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO RECOGNIZE AN OPPORTUNITY YOU COULD LEVERAGE OR YOU COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
trainval/CHxhjDPKfbY/50009 YOU NOW GET TO EXPERIENCE ALL THE STUFF THAT YOU WOULD COULD SHOULD NEED TO MIGHT OUGHT TO ALL THE STUFF PILING UP IN YOUR IN BASKETS AND
trainval/CHxhjDPKfbY/50010 EVERY SINGLE THING SEEMS TO DEMAND EQUAL KIND OF ATTENTION FROM YOU
trainval/CHxhjDPKfbY/50011 YOU HAVE MONEY
trainval/CHxhjDPKfbY/50012 THERE IS NO PERFECTION
trainval/CHxhjDPKfbY/50014 WHAT DOES IT DO
trainval/CHxhjDPKfbY/50015 OUTCOME AND ACTION
trainval/CHxhjDPKfbY/50016 ZEROS AND ONES OF PRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOR
trainval/CHxhjDPKfbY/50017 WRITE IT DOWN
trainval/CHxhjDPKfbY/50018 YOU WILL FEEL EXPONENTIALLY MORE APPROPRIATELY ENGAGED WITH YOUR WORLD
trainval/CHxhjDPKfbY/50019 WHAT'S MY JOB
trainval/CHxhjDPKfbY/50020 SO MY WISH FOR ALL OF YOU IS FOR ALL OF THOSE ADVENTURES COMING TOWARDS YOU AND THEY'RE COMING TOWARDS YOU IN ORDER TO TAKE
trainval/chXsLtHqfdM/50001 BUT INSTEAD OF ASKING THEM HOW COME THEY WERE NOT {LG}
trainval/chXsLtHqfdM/50002 IN ZAMBIA TO THIS SIZE
trainval/chXsLtHqfdM/50003 YOU SHOULD SEE THE RUBBISH THAT WE HAVE BESTOWED ON UNSUSPECTING AFRICAN PEOPLE
trainval/chXsLtHqfdM/50004 THE TWO WORDS COME FROM THE LATIN ROOT PATER WHICH MEANS FATHER
trainval/chXsLtHqfdM/50005 WE MEET AT THE PUB
trainval/chXsLtHqfdM/50006 THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS PASSION
trainval/chXsLtHqfdM/50007 YOU CAN GIVE SOMEBODY AN IDEA
trainval/chXsLtHqfdM/50008 AND THEN WE HELP THEM TO GO AND FIND THE KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE NOBODY IN THE WORLD CAN SUCCEED
trainval/chXsLtHqfdM/50009 CAN YOU HELP US
trainval/chXsLtHqfdM/50010 WHAT CAN YOU DO
trainval/chXsLtHqfdM/50011 CAN YOU LOOK AFTER THE MONEY
trainval/cI9vSC1eQ18/50001 ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF OUR UNIVERSE
trainval/cI9vSC1eQ18/50002 WE EXPECT IT TO START TAKING DATA BY THE END OF THIS DECADE
trainval/cI9vSC1eQ18/50003 AND IF WE WANT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION WE HAVE TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM IN DETAIL
trainval/cI9vSC1eQ18/50004 THREE YEARS TO FIND 42 SUPERNOVAE BY SEARCHING THROUGH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF GALAXIES
trainval/cI9vSC1eQ18/50005 ONE ROLL OF THE DICE WOULD TELL YOU VERY LITTLE BUT THE MORE TIMES YOU ROLLED THEM THE MORE DATA YOU
trainval/CiJ6ybBSm10/50001 AS SIMPLE AND AS INNOCENT AS THAT
trainval/CiJ6ybBSm10/50002 JUST TO PLAY THE GUITAR
trainval/CiJ6ybBSm10/50003 I HAVE A ROOM AT MY PLACE A ROOM AT MY PARENTS' PLACE
trainval/CiLnSGrcuEs/50001 AND I WAS THE UNDERDOG
trainval/CiLnSGrcuEs/50002 AND A FUNNY THING HAPPENED WHEN WE DID THAT
trainval/CiLnSGrcuEs/50003 I WAS RUNNING AGAINST A TWO TERM INCUMBENT AND MY OPPONENT RAN THE CLASSIC PARTISAN
trainval/CiLnSGrcuEs/50004 NOW WHY IS THAT STORY AND THAT APPROACH SO NOVEL
trainval/CiLnSGrcuEs/50005 AND SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS THINK ABOUT HOW CAN WE CHANGE THAT DYNAMIC
trainval/CiLnSGrcuEs/50006 AND USING THIS THEY EVALUATED OVER A THOUSAND FEDERAL PROGRAMS
trainval/CiLnSGrcuEs/50007 OVER 150 PROGRAMS HAD THEIR FUNDING REDUCED BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT DEMONSTRATE
trainval/CiLnSGrcuEs/50008 BUT UNFORTUNATELY THERE WASN'T EVER A WELL PUBLICIZED INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR THOSE PROGRAMS THAT DID
trainval/CiLnSGrcuEs/50009 GIULIANI SHRUNK THAT TIME FRAME SO THAT CRIME STATISTICS WOULD BE COLLECTED ON A DAILY EVEN
trainval/CiLnSGrcuEs/50010 WELL O'MALLEY LOVED THAT APPROACH AND HE APPLIED IT IN BALTIMORE
trainval/CiLnSGrcuEs/50011 AT THE DAWN OF THE 1920S TULSA WAS HOME TO THE MOST VIBRANT AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY IN THE COUNTRY
trainval/CiLnSGrcuEs/50012 THE GREENWOOD SECTION OF OUR CITY WAS KNOWN AS BLACK WALL STREET
trainval/CiLnSGrcuEs/50013 LET'S GRASP THE OPPORTUNITY THAT IS PRESENTED BY INNOVATION TO BUILD BETTER COMMUNITIES FOR
trainval/CiLnSGrcuEs/50014 LET'S REPLACE A FOCUS ON PARTISAN DIVISION WITH A FOCUS ON
trainval/CiLnSGrcuEs/50015 THAT IS THE PATH TO A BETTER FUTURE FOR US ALL
trainval/CiLnSGrcuEs/50016 AND I AM USING THIS APPROACH IN TULSA
trainval/CiLnSGrcuEs/50017 WHAT WE'VE FOUND IS ACTUALLY QUITE THE OPPOSITE
trainval/CilXrSYMA8U/50001 HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
trainval/CilXrSYMA8U/50002 WHERE DID THAT MUSIC COME FROM
trainval/CiSk3gmyjQ8/50001 THIS MEANS THAT IF IT IS NOT YOU IT IS SOMEBODY SITTING NEXT TO YOU
trainval/CiSk3gmyjQ8/50002 REMEMBER ALEX ONLY 13
trainval/CiSk3gmyjQ8/50003 WHAT A STRANGE THING
trainval/CiSk3gmyjQ8/50004 FOR EXAMPLE IF I GO TO A PSYCHIATRIST SAYING THAT I WANT TO COMMIT SUICIDE OR I HAVE EVEN TRIED TO
trainval/CiSk3gmyjQ8/50005 SHE WAS THAT TYPE OF FRIEND YOU WANT TO HAVE BECAUSE SHE MADE YOU FEEL MORE ALIVE
trainval/CiSk3gmyjQ8/50006 I WAS SCARED TO SAY THAT MY MUM HAD COMMITTED SUICIDE
trainval/CiSk3gmyjQ8/50007 AND I WOULD LIE I WOULD SAY THAT IT WAS CANCER OR A HEART ATTACK
trainval/CiSk3gmyjQ8/50008 AFTER A WHILE SHE CAME UP TO ME SHE HUGGED ME AND SHE SAID THANK YOU
trainval/CiSk3gmyjQ8/50009 SHE TOLD US THAT SHE HAD BEEN SUFFERING WITH A DEPRESSION FOR OVER FIVE YEARS AND THAT SHE DIDN'T ASK FOR
trainval/ciStnd9Y2ak/50001 AND WHILE WE WERE STRUGGLING WITH THIS PROBLEM AROUND 2005 STEWART BRAND CAME OUT AND HE
trainval/ciStnd9Y2ak/50002 THAT'S EVEN BEFORE YOU GET TO THE QUESTION OF STORAGE
trainval/ciStnd9Y2ak/50003 SO THE OBVIOUS RESPONSE IS WE'LL JUST PUT IT ALL IN BATTERIES
trainval/ciStnd9Y2ak/50004 MOST OF THAT REDUCTION IS JUST DUE TO THAT
trainval/ciStnd9Y2ak/50005 BECAUSE NATURAL GAS IS ABOUT HALF OF THE CARBON INTENSITY OF COAL AND THAT WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT
trainval/ciStnd9Y2ak/50006 WHAT ABOUT FUKUSHIMA
trainval/ciStnd9Y2ak/50007 WHAT ABOUT ALL THE NUCLEAR WASTE
trainval/ciStnd9Y2ak/50008 THOSE ARE REALLY REASONABLE QUESTIONS TO ASK
trainval/ciStnd9Y2ak/50009 SO IF WE JUST DO MORE SOLAR AND WIND WON'T IT KIND OF ALL WORK ITSELF OUT
trainval/ciStnd9Y2ak/50010 SO THAT'S KIND OF THE FIRST THING
trainval/ciStnd9Y2ak/50011 THIS IS CHERNOBYL
trainval/ciStnd9Y2ak/50012 ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES TO THIS HAS COME FROM SOMEBODY HERE IN GERMANY WHO IS NOT A PRO NUCLEAR PERSON AT
trainval/ciStnd9Y2ak/50014 YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SHELTER IN PLACE
trainval/ciStnd9Y2ak/50015 AND SO IT MAKES SENSE YOU'D THINK IF WE DO SOLAR WIND YOU CAN JUST GO A LOT FASTER
trainval/ciStnd9Y2ak/50016 HERE'S THIS REALLY BASIC SCIENCE IT IS RIGHT THERE ON THE WEBSITE
trainval/ciStnd9Y2ak/50017 WHAT ABOUT THE WEAPONS
trainval/ciStnd9Y2ak/50018 IF I THOUGHT THERE WAS ANY CHANCE MORE NUCLEAR POWER WOULD INCREASE THE CHANCE OF NUCLEAR WAR I'D BE AGAINST IT
trainval/ciStnd9Y2ak/50019 I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A PACIFIST
trainval/Cj04JUBXe2E/50001 HANDS IT BACK TO ME
trainval/Cj04JUBXe2E/50002 YOU ALL KNOW ABOUT EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS
trainval/Cj04JUBXe2E/50003 THEY'VE GOT GREAT POTENTIAL BUT HAVEN'T YET ENTERED CLINICAL TRIALS
trainval/Cj04JUBXe2E/50005 IT MAY ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE TO SIGN UP TO BE POTENTIAL LIVE SAVING BONE MARROW DONORS
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50001 WORKING LIKE THIS DOES NOT COME NATURALLY TO ME
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50002 I AM VERY INDIVIDUALISTIC
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50003 I ALWAYS HAVE BEEN
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50004 I GOT GOOD GRADES IN SCHOOL BUT I DIDN'T LIKE BEING THERE DOING THE SAME THINGS AS EVERYBODY ELSE
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50005 IT WAS MY DREAM TO BE AN ACTOR I WENT TO UNIVERSITY TO STUDY THEATER AND I DIDN'T LIKE BEING IN PLAYS WITH OTHER PEOPLE
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50006 I WANTED TO DO MY THING MY WAY I GRAVITATED TOWARDS DOING ONE MAN SHOWS
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50007 THIS IS WHAT I DO NOW FOR A LIVING
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50008 THERE'S JUST ME AND THE AUDIENCE
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50009 I GET 100 CREATIVE CONTROL
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50010 SO NOW WHEN I'M WRITING SOMETHING FOR BEAMS AND STRUTS I'LL WORK ON IT AND WORK AND WORK TILL I REACH A POINT WHERE THE ARTICLE
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50011 THERE HAVEN'T BEEN THAT MANY TECHNOLOGICAL PARADIGM SHIFTS
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50012 IT'S A RARE EVENT
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50013 WRITING IS TECHNOLOGY
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50015 THEY'RE ALL VERY SIMPLE AND VERY BASIC
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50016 ANYBODY CAN USE THEM IN THEIR LIVES WHETHER THEY'RE RUNNING A WEBSITE OR NOT
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50017 SO THE INNER SCRIPT IS TO DEFEND MY POSITION NO MATTER WHAT FACTS ARE ACTUALLY BEING EXCHANGED
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50018 AND IF THEY'RE APPROACHING WITH THE SAME ATTITUDE THEN THERE IS NO DUALISTIC WINNING AND LOSING
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50019 WE'RE BOTH LISTENING AND ASKING QUESTIONS
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50020 WE'VE BOTH SPENT AT LEAST SOME TIME LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE WE WERE EMOTIONALLY INVESTED IN FROM A NEW POINT OF VIEW
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50021 AND WE WERE LISTENING
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50022 AND THEN I ACTUALLY READ THE NOTES
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50023 ANOTHER THEME WEEK WAS ABOUT COMMUNITY AND THE MOST RECENT ONE WAS ABOUT WOMEN
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50024 FOR THAT ONE WE UPPED THE ENGAGEMENT
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50025 AND THERE'S THAT WEB BROWSER SINGING ITS SIREN SONG OF TEMPORARILY RELIEF IN DISTRACTION AND THERE'S 1001
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50026 ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE GROUP REFERRED TO IT AS LITERARY YOGA
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50027 IT'S UPPED OUR PRODUCTIVITY THE QUALITY OF OUR WRITING AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE IT'S GOING TO KEEP GOING IN THIS DIRECTION
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50028 LET'S SEE WHAT A BUNCH OF US CAN DO THAT WE COULDN'T DO ON OUR OWN
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50029 THERE IS A GROWING TIDE OF THIS OUT THERE IN THE DIGITAL AGE EVEN THOUGH THERE'S SO MUCH DUALISTIC DEBATING AND INSTANT GRATIFICATION
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50030 IT'S PART OF MY PROCESS NOW
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50031 IF I WANTED TO SURF DOWN A RIVER OF LAVA WHAT WOULD THE SURFBOARD NEED TO BE MADE OUT OF
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50032 THERE GOES THAT REACTION AGAIN
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50034 I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING MOST OF US KNOW DEEP DOWN
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50035 SOMETHING BARBARA EHRENREICH ONE OF MY FAVORITE WRITERS JOURNALISTS AUTHOR AWESOME PERSON
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50036 IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S A TUG A WAR GOING ON FOR THE FUTURE
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50038 WE'RE EXTRACTING NON RENEWABLE RESOURCES FROM THE EARTH AS FAST AS WE CAN AND WHO CARES ABOUT THE DAMAGE
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50039 MORE PEOPLE THAN EVER ARE WILLING TO WORK AS A TEAM EVEN WITH STRANGERS TO SHARE EVEN WITH STRANGERS
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50040 WHAT CAN WE DO
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50041 A LOT OF OUR FOOD COMES FROM FACTORY FARMS AND FACTORY SHIPS MONOCROP AGRIBUSINESS LOADED WITH GMOS SHIPPED ACROSS THE COUNTRY OR
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50042 WE CAN CHOOSE TO PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER AND BUILD ON WHAT WE AND OTHERS KNOW
trainval/cj5LZBmiQu4/50043 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
trainval/CjB6DQGalU0/50001 WHAT WE NOW HAVE ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS TO A VERY EXCITING FUTURE WHEN IT COMES TO ARTS AND CULTURE
trainval/CjB6DQGalU0/50002 NONE OF THIS BELONGS TO GOOGLE
trainval/CjB6DQGalU0/50003 AND THE WAY I DID IT WAS I REALIZED ONE DAY THAT SHE LOVES GOLD
trainval/CjB6DQGalU0/50004 ONCE YOU GET IN YOU'RE HOOKED
trainval/CjB6DQGalU0/50005 BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT MOST OF US CAN'T DO IT AND THE ONES THAT CAN AFFORD TO DO IT IT'S COMPLICATED
trainval/CK5w3wh4GSM/50002 THAT MAKE MICROORGANISMS MORE DIFFICULT TO HANDLE SAFELY THAN A SIMPLE TOXIN
trainval/CK5w3wh4GSM/50003 THEY MAY USE SOME OF THE THINGS WE CARE ABOUT OUR RAW MATERIALS AND OUR STUFF TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR ENDS
trainval/CK5w3wh4GSM/50004 SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE BEING ACTIVELY PURSUED BY RESEARCHERS AT MY HOME INSTITUTION THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY INSTITUTE
trainval/CK5w3wh4GSM/50005 IT WOULD ALSO DEPEND TO SOME EXTENT ON AN ANSWER TO QUESTION ONE SO THAT WE KNOW HOW TO PREVENT INTELLIGENCE
trainval/cK74vhqzeeQ/50001 SOME USE AND ADVOCATE VIOLENCE
trainval/cK74vhqzeeQ/50002 SOME DO NOT THOUGH THEY'RE OFTEN INTERRELATED
trainval/cK74vhqzeeQ/50003 BUT IN ANY CASE THESE ARE ALL RADICAL PROJECTS
trainval/cK74vhqzeeQ/50004 THEY'RE NOT CONSERVATIVE OR TRADITIONAL APPROACHES
trainval/cK74vhqzeeQ/50005 THEY'RE MOST OFTEN ABOUT CHANGING PEOPLE'S RELATIONSHIP WITH ISLAM RATHER THAN PRESERVING IT
trainval/cK74vhqzeeQ/50006 WHEN I LOOK BACK NOW I THINK THAT THAT WAS THE MOMENT THAT SET ME ON THE PATH WAS TO WRITING A BOOK CALLED YOUR
trainval/cK74vhqzeeQ/50007 AS FAIZAN SAID AT THE TIME IF WE BOW DOWN TO THE ISLAMISTS WE'LL JUST BE SITTING IN A DARK CORNER
trainval/cK74vhqzeeQ/50008 AND SHE SAID I KNOW THAT BUT I CAME TO YOUR FESTIVAL WITH MY MOTHER WHEN I WAS THEIR AGE AND I
trainval/cK74vhqzeeQ/50009 WE HAVE TO BE HERE
trainval/cK74vhqzeeQ/50010 AND IT IS SIMPLY THAT FOR HER A BETTER FUTURE FOR ALL THE MARIA BASHIRS TO COME IS WORTH THE
trainval/cK74vhqzeeQ/50011 AN AFGHAN PROSECUTOR HAS BEEN ASSASSINATED
trainval/cK74vhqzeeQ/50012 FAR AWAY IN THE AMERICAN MIDWEST I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE OF MEETING SOMALI AMERICANS WHO WERE WORKING TO COUNTER THE
trainval/cK74vhqzeeQ/50013 SINCE THAT TIME MR
trainval/cK74vhqzeeQ/50014 YOU AND FATHER MUST KEEP YOUR HEADS HELD HIGH
trainval/cK74vhqzeeQ/50015 IN FACT AMEL'S SISTER LAMIA OVERCAME HER GRIEF WENT TO LAW SCHOOL AND PRACTICES AS A LAWYER IN
trainval/CkDYlQhx0wY/50001 A SELFIE WHATEVER
trainval/CkDYlQhx0wY/50002 THE PERSON NEXT TO YOU
trainval/CkDYlQhx0wY/50003 IT'S A PROPER NOUN
trainval/cKGFSkQh1h4/50001 WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED BRINGING UP A LOT OF OUR REHABILITATION PROGRAMS
trainval/cKGFSkQh1h4/50002 SO WELCOME AND THANK YOU ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION
trainval/CLSSiaFuLo4/50001 IT WAS BETTER IN PERSON I PROMISE
trainval/CLSSiaFuLo4/50002 BUT IT WAS A GOOD MOMENT
trainval/CLSSiaFuLo4/50003 WHEN YOU HEARD THE NEWS WERE YOU EXCITED
trainval/CLSSiaFuLo4/50004 WERE YOU AFRAID
trainval/CLSSiaFuLo4/50006 THEY SAID OH MY GOD WE'RE SO GLAD SHE'S PREGNANT
trainval/CLSSiaFuLo4/50007 BUT THEN YOU ALWAYS HAVE THESE CRANKY YANKEES
trainval/CLSSiaFuLo4/50008 I'VE BEEN A PRO FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS AND SO FOR ME IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HOLD WOMEN UP AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THESE YOUNG WOMEN THEY'LL COME
trainval/CLSSiaFuLo4/50009 HAVE YOU THOUGHT AM I COMING BACK
trainval/CLSSiaFuLo4/50010 WILL I TAKE SOME TIME OFF
trainval/CLSSiaFuLo4/50011 I'M REALLY INSPIRED BY MY SISTER
trainval/CLSSiaFuLo4/50012 YOUR BODY BRINGS MEN AND WOMEN TO THEIR KNEES
trainval/CLSSiaFuLo4/50014 SO FOR ME I'VE ALWAYS FELT LIKE I LOVED THAT FEELING AND OBVIOUSLY I DON'T
trainval/CLSSiaFuLo4/50015 SHE'S TALL SHE'S FAST SHE HITS HARD LIKE ME SHE SERVES LIKE ME
trainval/CLSSiaFuLo4/50016 I LOVE MY FREEDOM
trainval/CLSSiaFuLo4/50017 I HAVE THREE SISTERS
trainval/CLSSiaFuLo4/50018 AND I WAS JUST LAUGHING AT HER
trainval/CLSSiaFuLo4/50019 BECAUSE NOW LITTLE GIRLS ARE LOOKING AT YOU SAYING I WANT TO BE LIKE THAT
trainval/CLSSiaFuLo4/50020 SO I DID THAT AND I FELT THAT TO BE THE BEST AND IF YOU WANT TO BE THE BEST YOU HAVE TO HANG
trainval/CLSSiaFuLo4/50021 THE ONLY REASON I AM WHO I AM IS BECAUSE OF MY LOSSES AND SOME OF THEM ARE EXTREMELY PAINFUL BUT
trainval/CLSSiaFuLo4/50022 DON'T LIVE IN THE PAST LIVE IN THE PRESENT AND DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES IN THE FUTURE
trainval/CLSSiaFuLo4/50023 I DIDN'T LIKE IT
trainval/CLSSiaFuLo4/50025 AND I STOPPED LIFTING WEIGHTS
trainval/CLSSiaFuLo4/50026 I WAS LIKE I'M NOT GOING TO DO THIS
trainval/CLSSiaFuLo4/50027 BUT THEN AFTER I WON THE US OPEN I REALIZED THAT MY BODY HELPED ME REACH GOALS THAT I WANTED TO REACH AND
trainval/CLSSiaFuLo4/50028 I'M ALWAYS HEALTHY
trainval/CLWRclarri0/50001 AND THAT'S GOING TO POSE AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM
trainval/CMeRySbMXDU/50001 NOW I AM NOT A GRAPHIC ARTIST IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM SO I MADE THE PAGE AS PRETTY AS I POSSIBLY COULD
trainval/cmFSHbPSjd0/50001 I BELIEVE THAT MUSIC HAS POWER TO GIVE PEOPLE HOPE AND TO HELP THEM FEEL
trainval/cmFSHbPSjd0/50002 I LOVE THAT AND I ALWAYS TRY TO REMEMBER THAT WHEN I SIT DOWN TO PLAY
trainval/cMhPOiuDzBc/50001 OUR VIEWS AND OUR ATTITUDES ABOUT AGING ARE MAJOR INDICATORS OF HOW WE'LL
trainval/cMhPOiuDzBc/50002 I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT NEITHER OF THESE LADIES ARE SITTING AT HOME IN THEIR ROCKING CHAIR WAITING TO
trainval/cMhPOiuDzBc/50003 A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I'VE SNAGGED ONE OF THE LAST TICKETS TO SEE WILLIE NELSON PERFORM AT THE EISENMAN
trainval/cMhPOiuDzBc/50004 AND GRANDMA MOSES GOD LOVE HER DIDN'T START PAINTING UNTIL SHE WAS 76 YEARS OLD PROVING THAT THERE IS HOPE FOR
trainval/cMhPOiuDzBc/50005 SO LET'S CELEBRATE LIFE
trainval/cmlRinjYKfM/50001 WE PASS IT DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION
trainval/cMXFiYhm79g/50001 I HAVE DONE WRONG
trainval/cMXFiYhm79g/50002 WHAT CAN CREATURES LIKE US KNOW OF SUCH THINGS
trainval/cMXFiYhm79g/50003 HE TOOK SOME MONEY WE'LL TAKE HIS MONEY
trainval/cn9Q4c3dXGU/50001 WE NEED HUMAN CELLS BUT WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO KEEP THEM HAPPY OUTSIDE THE BODY
trainval/cn9Q4c3dXGU/50002 IT REALLY JUST ISN'T WORKING AND THAT MEANS THAT PATIENTS THAT BADLY NEED NEW
trainval/cn9Q4c3dXGU/50003 OUR CELLS EXPERIENCE THAT
trainval/cn9Q4c3dXGU/50004 THEY'VE EVEN TRY TO GROW LITTLE MINI ORGANS IN THE LAB
trainval/cn9Q4c3dXGU/50005 WELL THERE'S A MULTITUDE OF FACTORS AT PLAY BUT I THINK ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS IS THAT THE TOOLS THAT
trainval/cn9Q4c3dXGU/50006 NOW I WANT TO SHARE THIS PICTURE WITH YOU
trainval/cn9Q4c3dXGU/50007 I WANT TO SHARE THIS WITH YOU BECAUSE IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PHOTOGRAPH
trainval/cn9Q4c3dXGU/50008 WHEN THEY GET DAMAGED SAY BY CIGARETTE SMOKE FOR EXAMPLE THEY DON'T WORK PROPERLY
trainval/cn9Q4c3dXGU/50009 NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FIRST ONE
trainval/cn9Q4c3dXGU/50010 THERE'S FLUID FLOWING ACROSS THESE CELLS SO WE CAN BEGIN TO INTERCONNECT MULTIPLE DIFFERENT CHIPS
trainval/cn9Q4c3dXGU/50011 AND WHY ARE THIS USEFUL
trainval/cn9Q4c3dXGU/50012 CHILDREN ARE NOT ADULTS THEY MAY NOT RESPOND IN THE SAME WAY ADULTS DO
trainval/cn9Q4c3dXGU/50013 THERE ARE OTHER THINGS LIKE GENETIC DIFFERENCES IN POPULATIONS THAT MAY LEAD TO
trainval/cn9Q4c3dXGU/50014 NOW IMAGINE IF WE COULD TAKE CELLS FROM ALL THOSE DIFFERENT POPULATIONS PUT THEM ON CHIPS AND CREATE
trainval/cn9Q4c3dXGU/50015 AND WE'RE DOING JUST THAT
trainval/cn9Q4c3dXGU/50016 WE'RE ESTABLISHING IMPORTANT INDUSTRY COLLABORATIONS SUCH AS THE ONE WE HAVE WITH
trainval/cn9Q4c3dXGU/50017 AND THIS IS KEY TO THE POTENTIAL OF THAT TECHNOLOGY
trainval/cn9Q4c3dXGU/50018 PLUG AND PLAY
trainval/cn9Q4c3dXGU/50019 AND THOSE INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES MEAN THAT WE COULD REACT VERY DIFFERENTLY AND SOMETIMES IN
trainval/cn9Q4c3dXGU/50020 I JUST COULDN'T SHAKE IT THOUGHT I'LL TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT
trainval/cn9Q4c3dXGU/50021 I TOOK SOME ADVIL
trainval/cn9Q4c3dXGU/50022 15 MINUTES LATER I WAS ON MY WAY TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM WITH A FULL BLOWN ASTHMA ATTACK
trainval/cnDEVgxD6QQ/50001 MY FAMILY AND I ACTUALLY EMIGRATED HERE FROM IRAN DURING THE WAR
trainval/cnDEVgxD6QQ/50002 HE THOUGHT WE WERE NUTS
trainval/cnDEVgxD6QQ/50003 SO GROWING UP HERE MY FATHER WAS HEAVILY INTO TECHNOLOGY SO I NATURALLY FELL INTO IT
trainval/cnDEVgxD6QQ/50004 YOU'D GET ON THE BIKE IT SWAYS IT WOBBLES YOU FALL
trainval/cnDEVgxD6QQ/50005 WE ALL KNOW THAT SINKING FEELING WHEN YOU THINK YOU FORGOT YOUR MOBILE DEVICE
trainval/cnDEVgxD6QQ/50006 YOU'VE GOT TO RUN BACK HOME BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE GOING TO FUNCTION WITHOUT IT
trainval/cnDEVgxD6QQ/50007 I HAD A DINNER PARTY A FEW WEEKS AGO AND I WAS RUNNING AROUND AND I HAD NO IDEA IF PEOPLE ACTUALLY ENJOYED
trainval/cnDEVgxD6QQ/50008 HE REINVENTED THE WAY THAT WE PURCHASE SHOES BECAUSE HE HAD A PASSION FOR DELIVERING HAPPINESS
trainval/cnDEVgxD6QQ/50009 HIS TEAM CREATED ZAPPOS
trainval/cnDEVgxD6QQ/50010 WHY DID HE DO ALL THAT
trainval/cnDEVgxD6QQ/50011 NO HE HAD ALREADY MADE MILLIONS AND LOST IT
trainval/cnDEVgxD6QQ/50012 THESE DEVICES ARE WHAT WE CALL THE INTERNET OF THINGS
trainval/cnDEVgxD6QQ/50013 IT'S HOW WE DO WHAT WE DO
trainval/cnQFvrWDYsU/50001 COULD WE HAVE PEOPLE SINGING TOGETHER IN REAL TIME
trainval/cnQFvrWDYsU/50002 AND WITH THE HELP OF SKYPE THAT IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO ATTEMPT TODAY
trainval/cnxEP6bzg7o/50001 THE OTHERS WOULD BE WEAK OR CRACKED
trainval/co2enjjt3J0/50001 I ALSO MOVED INTO HOUSING THAT I SHARED WITH PEOPLE WHO WORKED AT THE LAB
trainval/co2enjjt3J0/50002 OVER A COUPLE YEARS I LIVED IN THREE DIFFERENT HOMES WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE WHO WORKED AT THE LAB
trainval/co2enjjt3J0/50003 SO THEY WEREN'T POLITICAL IDEOLOGUES THEY DIDN'T DO THIS BECAUSE THEY FELT PASSIONATELY HOSTILE TO COMMUNISM
trainval/co2enjjt3J0/50004 THEY DIDN'T SAY WELL I REALLY WANTED TO DESIGN NUCLEAR WEAPONS
trainval/co2enjjt3J0/50005 I INTERVIEWED A PROFESSOR AT A UNIVERSITY WHO TRAINED A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WENT ON TO WORK AT THE WEAPONS LABS
trainval/co2enjjt3J0/50006 SO I SOON REALIZED THAT THEY WERE THINKING ABOUT THE ETHICS OF THE WORK BUT THE LAB DIDN'T CREATE A SPACE
trainval/co2enjjt3J0/50007 THIS RESULTED IN A COUPLE OF BOOKS
trainval/co2enjjt3J0/50008 PRESIDENT GEORGE H
trainval/co2enjjt3J0/50009 I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH THREE THOUGHTS
trainval/co2enjjt3J0/50010 NOW THEY'RE NOT EVEN TESTED UNDERGROUND
trainval/co2enjjt3J0/50011 THEY LOOK PRETTY AND PSYCHEDELIC LIKE THIS
trainval/co2enjjt3J0/50012 THERE'S A REAL DANGER IN THAT ABSTRACTION
trainval/co2enjjt3J0/50013 THE FIVE OFFICIAL NUCLEAR POWERS HAVE NO PLANS TO ABOLISH THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS
trainval/cOIJGGgaSIY/50001 I WAS BEING TAUGHT IN FRENCH AND ENGLISH ALL THE TIME
trainval/cOIJGGgaSIY/50002 I FOUND THAT THAT WAS HOME
trainval/cOIJGGgaSIY/50003 WHEN I LEFT HIGH SCHOOL AND I CAME TO UNIVERSITY I BROUGHT THAT MODEL ALONG WITH ME
trainval/cOIJGGgaSIY/50004 AND I WAS REALLY BUSY FIRST YEAR
trainval/cOIJGGgaSIY/50005 I WAS HAVING A WHALE OF A TIME
trainval/cOIJGGgaSIY/50006 I WAS THE ONLY ONE TO THINK THAT
trainval/cOIJGGgaSIY/50007 WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT WHEN A SURGEON MAKES A MISTAKE HE KILLS THE PATIENT THAT'S IN FRONT
trainval/cOIJGGgaSIY/50008 ALSO THERE WERE LOTS OF GREAT SPEAKERS
trainval/cOIJGGgaSIY/50009 I'M LIKE OH THAT'S FUNNY
trainval/cOIJGGgaSIY/50010 MY FACIAL EXPRESSION DIDN'T CHANGE AT ALL
trainval/cOIJGGgaSIY/50011 AND IT WAS JUST HIM SPEAKING
trainval/cOIJGGgaSIY/50012 WE WERE ALL REALLY ENCOURAGED AND INSPIRED FOR THE ENTIRE FOUR DAYS OF THE DEBATE BECAUSE THESE WERE PEOPLE WHO SAW
trainval/cOIJGGgaSIY/50013 WE NEED TO MAKE TWO CHANGES TO THE WAY WE THINK AND INCORPORATE ENGINEERS
trainval/cOIJGGgaSIY/50014 THERE ISN'T MUCH SHARING THERE
trainval/cOIJGGgaSIY/50015 WE NEED THE PROFESSIONALS TO CHANGE THAT
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50001 I CAN GUARANTEE YOU WHATEVER TROUBLE YOU WENT TO IS PEANUTS COMPARED TO
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50002 WATER IS QUITE DENSE
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50003 ONE LITER WEIGHS ONE KILOGRAM SO A 20 LITER JERRY CAN WILL WEIGH
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50004 IF YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'LL HAVE A DONKEY TO CARRY IT FOR YOU
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50005 AND THIS IS WHERE JOE BARNES CAME IN
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50006 BECAUSE HE'D WORKED ALL OVER THE DEVELOPING WORLD
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50007 HE'D WORKED IN REFUGEE CAMPS
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50008 HE'D WORKED IN LEPER COLONIES
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50009 AND HE'D NOTICED THAT NO MATTER HOW POOR A SITUATION THERE WAS ALWAYS A WELL KNOWN FIZZY DRINK ON
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50010 I BELIEVE YOU'RE THE NEW PHYSICIST CHAPPY
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50011 AND THEY DID THIS 200 YEARS AGO
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50012 SO HE MAY NOT HAVE INVENTED IT BUT HE WAS THE PERSON WHO INTRODUCED ME TO IT
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50014 AND WHO CAN RESIST AN OPENING LINE LIKE THAT
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50015 IT'S BY FAR THE CHEAPEST METHOD OF WATER TREATMENT
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50016 WE'LL FIND OUT
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50017 WE WERE DOING A STUDY IN KENYA WHEN THERE WAS AN OUTBREAK OF CHOLERA
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50018 THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH IMMEDIATELY PUT ALL THE EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS IN PLACE
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50019 BUT WE WENT BACK AFTERWARDS TO SEE WHETHER THERE HAD BEEN ANY PROTECTIVE EFFECT
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50020 CHILD HEALTH BENEFIT
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50021 CHILD DEVELOPMENT BENEFIT
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50022 IN FACT WE VERY OFTEN FIND PROMOTING WATER TREATMENT ON THE BASIS OF IMPROVED FAMILY
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50023 THAT WAS A CONCERN WE'VE HAD ALL THE WAY THROUGH
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50024 SO WE ALWAYS SAY REPLACE YOUR BOTTLES AFTER 6 MONTHS
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50025 NOT BECAUSE ANYTHING GOES WRONG WITH THEM
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50026 WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AFTER 6 MONTHS
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50027 SO THEY GET A DOUBLE WHAMMY
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50028 AND YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WELL WHY IS THAT
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50029 I'M TRYING TO SAY
trainval/cotBM0laSSo/50030 BUT I'M TRYING TO CONVINCE YOU THAT THE WATER IS SAFE
trainval/COwSbfCgXBw/50001 IS THAT WHY YOU DON'T HOLD ME ANYMORE FATHER
trainval/COwSbfCgXBw/50002 CAN YOU BREATHE NOW
trainval/COwSbfCgXBw/50003 AND I'VE REACHED THE END OF MY CONFESSIONS
trainval/COwSbfCgXBw/50004 I WILL SIT HERE ON THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR CHURCH WAITING FOR YOU TO PUT THIS MARBLE SINNER INSIDE OF YOUR CHURCH
trainval/COwSbfCgXBw/50005 I AM YOUR ARCHANGEL WITHOUT A HALO
trainval/COwSbfCgXBw/50006 ROLLED OFF MY TONGUE
trainval/CpaFX6Ei0nU/50001 I BECAME WHAT I SAW EVERY DAY
trainval/CpaFX6Ei0nU/50002 I DON'T DESERVE THIS
trainval/CpaFX6Ei0nU/50003 I DIDN'T WORK FOR IT
trainval/CpaFX6Ei0nU/50004 AND AT THAT MOMENT I REALIZED THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ME
trainval/CpaFX6Ei0nU/50005 THAT APATHETIC ATTITUDE POURED OVER INTO HIGH SCHOOL AND I EVENTUALLY GOT KICKED OUT OF THREE DIFFERENT HIGH
trainval/CpaFX6Ei0nU/50006 I DIDN'T CONSIDER MYSELF A CRIMINAL
trainval/CpaFX6Ei0nU/50007 IT WAS THEN THAT I SAID TO MYSELF THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU ANYMORE
trainval/CpaFX6Ei0nU/50008 THIS IS ABOUT YOUR FAMILY
trainval/CpaFX6Ei0nU/50009 I COULDN'T PUT MY SISTER AND MY MOTHER THROUGH THAT AGAIN
trainval/CpaFX6Ei0nU/50010 SO AT THAT POINT I SAID YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE A CHANGE
trainval/CpaFX6Ei0nU/50011 THERE ARE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL COMPONENTS OF THE MODEL AND ALSO CHANCES TO DEVELOP LEADERSHIP SKILLS WHICH
trainval/CpaFX6Ei0nU/50012 DON'T SAY IT'S NOT FOR YOU UNLESS YOU GIVE IT A SHOT
trainval/CpaFX6Ei0nU/50013 HEY WE'LL PAY FOR IT WE'LL BRING YOU TO THE CLASS YOU KNOW
trainval/CpaFX6Ei0nU/50014 IF IT DOESN'T WORK WHAT'S THE LOSS TO YOU
trainval/CpaFX6Ei0nU/50015 SO I TOOK THEM UP ON THEIR OFFER
trainval/CpaFX6Ei0nU/50016 RECEIVING THAT GRADE MOTIVATED ME TO WANT TO GO ON IMMEDIATELY IN FULL TIME IN THE NEXT SEMESTER
trainval/CpaFX6Ei0nU/50017 AND SO I DID SO
trainval/CpaFX6Ei0nU/50019 WOULD THE WORLD BE A BETTER PLACE
trainval/CpaFX6Ei0nU/50020 THEY SERVED AS MY COUNSELORS THEY CAME TO MY HOUSE UNANNOUNCED TO MAKE SURE I WAS OK
trainval/CpkXmtJOH84/50001 OUR CELLS EXPERIENCE THAT
trainval/CpkXmtJOH84/50002 THEY'VE EVEN TRIED TO GROW LITTLE MINI ORGANS IN THE LAB
trainval/CpkXmtJOH84/50003 WHEN THEY GET DAMAGED SAY BY CIGARETTE SMOKE FOR EXAMPLE THEY DON'T WORK PROPERLY AND THEY
trainval/CpkXmtJOH84/50004 THIS IS A DISEASE THAT AFFECTS A LARGE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS
trainval/CpkXmtJOH84/50005 IS IT EXCRETED IN YOUR KIDNEYS
trainval/CpkXmtJOH84/50006 WE CAN BEGIN TO STUDY THE DYNAMIC RESPONSE OF THE BODY TO A DRUG
trainval/CpkXmtJOH84/50007 TENDS TO BE MIDDLE AGED TENDS TO BE FEMALE
trainval/CpkXmtJOH84/50008 YOU WON'T FIND MANY CLINICAL TRIALS IN WHICH CHILDREN ARE INVOLVED YET EVERY DAY WE GIVE
trainval/CpkXmtJOH84/50009 CHILDREN ARE NOT ADULTS
trainval/CpkXmtJOH84/50010 PLUG AND PLAY
trainval/CpkXmtJOH84/50011 I TOOK SOME ADVIL
trainval/CpkXmtJOH84/50012 FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER I WAS ON MY WAY TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM WITH A FULL BLOWN ASTHMA ATTACK
trainval/cPL2FE7ZPTg/50001 WHEN THE TALK AROUND TOWN ABOUT MY FATHER BEING A DRUNK WAS NO LONGER JUST GOSSIP AND I THOUGHT THAT EVERYONE EVERYWHERE KNEW
trainval/cPL2FE7ZPTg/50002 FOR A FEW THIS MIGHT BE TRUE
trainval/cPL2FE7ZPTg/50003 PERFECTIONISTS STRIVE TO BE FLAWLESS THEY SEE THEIR MISTAKES AS A CHARACTER FLAW
trainval/cPL2FE7ZPTg/50004 PERFECTIONISM COMES IN MANY COLOURS BUT IT SPEAKS THE LANGUAGE OF BLACK OR WHITE
trainval/cPL2FE7ZPTg/50005 I HAVE WON PRETTY MUCH EVERY FITNESS ACCOLADE THAT THERE IS TO WIN AND I HAVE EVEN BEEN ON THE BACK OF A SPECIAL K
trainval/cPL2FE7ZPTg/50006 I SHARE THIS WITH YOU NOT TO BRAG BUT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT EVEN WITH ALL OF THAT
trainval/cPL2FE7ZPTg/50007 IF YOU ARE LIKE ME YOU MIGHT NOT REALISE YOU HAVE THIS UNTIL IT IS TOO LATE
trainval/cPL2FE7ZPTg/50008 UNTIL YOU LOOK BACK AND NOTICE ALL THOSE MOMENTS MISSING JOY
trainval/cPL2FE7ZPTg/50009 YOU LOOK AT ALL THOSE RELATIONSHIPS DAMAGED OR DESTROYED BECAUSE YOU WERE TOO BUSY BEING PERFECT TO BE
trainval/cPL2FE7ZPTg/50010 I JUST NEVER KNEW WHEN IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN OR WHERE
trainval/cPL2FE7ZPTg/50011 WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE EVOLVED OUR THINKING
trainval/cPL2FE7ZPTg/50012 AND WE STOPPED TRYING TO BE PERFECTIONISTS AND AS MY TEACHER AND THOUGHT LEADER TAL BEN SHAHAR SAYS
trainval/cPL2FE7ZPTg/50013 PERFECTIONISTS LOOK TO SEE HOW FAR THEY HAVE GOT TO GO
trainval/cPL2FE7ZPTg/50014 WE ALSO GET TO STRETCH THE BELIEF AND KNOWLEDGE OF JUST HOW MUCH WE ARE CAPABLE OF
trainval/cPL2FE7ZPTg/50015 PERFECTIONISTS ARE TERRIFIED OF MAKING A MISTAKE AND ARE SO THREATENED BY THE SUCCESS OF OTHERS
trainval/cplaWsiu7Yg/50001 WHEREAS THE CHICKENS ARE ACTUALLY MATURE WITHIN A COUPLE OF MONTHS
trainval/cplaWsiu7Yg/50002 AND THAT ONE BIG DISADVANTAGE IS THAT UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY DO ALL THAT LEARNING YOU'RE GOING TO BE HELPLESS
trainval/cplaWsiu7Yg/50003 WE DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING
trainval/cplaWsiu7Yg/50004 THEY GO OUT AND TEST IT AGAINST THE EVIDENCE
trainval/cplaWsiu7Yg/50005 AND WHAT BAYES SHOWED WAS A MATHEMATICAL WAY THAT YOU COULD DO THAT
trainval/cplaWsiu7Yg/50006 BECAUSE AFTER ALL IF YOU ASK EVEN GROWNUPS ABOUT STATISTICS THEY LOOK EXTREMELY STUPID
trainval/cplaWsiu7Yg/50007 AND IN STUDIES WE'VE JUST BEEN DOING IN MY LAB SIMILAR STUDIES WE'VE SHOW THAT FOUR YEAR OLDS ARE ACTUALLY BETTER AT
trainval/cplaWsiu7Yg/50008 SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE PAY ATTENTION IS THAT THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX THE SORT OF EXECUTIVE PART OF OUR BRAINS SENDS A SIGNAL
trainval/cPsP4F1qYCI/50001 IT SCARED ME BECAUSE I LOOK TO THE FUTURE AND I'M EXCITED
trainval/cPsP4F1qYCI/50002 I'M EXCITED BECAUSE I WANT A WIFE I WANT A CHILD I WANT A FAMILY
trainval/cPsP4F1qYCI/50003 BUT WILL I BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT FAMILY IN PEACE
trainval/cPsP4F1qYCI/50004 OR WILL SOME MAD MAN WITH A GUN RIP IT AWAY FROM ME BECAUSE MY IDENTITY DIFFERS TO THE NORM
trainval/cPsP4F1qYCI/50005 WE ALL CAME TOGETHER AND STOOD AS ONE
trainval/cPsP4F1qYCI/50006 AND IN DOING SO WE FORMED A FAMILY
trainval/cPsP4F1qYCI/50007 IN MOST SCENARIOS MINORITIES THEY HAVE THEIR FAMILY
trainval/cPsP4F1qYCI/50008 MUSLIM PEOPLE USUALLY HAVE MUSLIM FAMILIES
trainval/cPsP4F1qYCI/50009 BLACK PEOPLE USUALLY HAVE BLACK FAMILIES
trainval/cPsP4F1qYCI/50010 SO WE TURN TO OUR LGBT FAMILY
trainval/cPsP4F1qYCI/50011 WE NEED PEOPLE TO ACCEPT US BECAUSE IF EVERY HETEROSEXUAL PERSON WAS PART OF OUR EXTENDED FAMILY
trainval/cPsP4F1qYCI/50012 BEFORE I FINISH I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU THE WORDS OF A MAN WHO DID JUST THAT
trainval/cPsP4F1qYCI/50013 WHILE COLLECTING HIS TONY AWARD ON WORLDWIDE TELEVISION SPEECH WRITER AND PLAYWRIGHT LIN
trainval/cPsP4F1qYCI/50014 HAMILTON HAS PROVED THAT HISTORY REMEMBERS
trainval/cPsP4F1qYCI/50015 WE LIVE IN TIMES WHERE HATE AND FEAR SEEM STRONGER
trainval/cpsRAk5HpK4/50001 BEING INFECTED EVERY YEAR
trainval/cpsRAk5HpK4/50002 IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
trainval/cpsRAk5HpK4/50003 IT'S THE SAME MOSQUITO AND IT'S THE SAME DISEASE
trainval/cpsRAk5HpK4/50004 AND THAT'S THE NICKNAME GIVEN TO THIS DISEASE
trainval/cpsRAk5HpK4/50005 THAT'S TWO DAYS AGO
trainval/cpsRAk5HpK4/50006 WELL THERE'S TWO PRINCIPLE WAYS
trainval/cpsRAk5HpK4/50007 YOU USE CHEMICALS
trainval/cpsRAk5HpK4/50008 YOU PUT THEM INTO WATER WHERE THEY BREED
trainval/cpsRAk5HpK4/50009 NOW IN AN URBAN ENVIRONMENT THAT'S EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT
trainval/cpsRAk5HpK4/50010 AND THE MOSQUITO HAS KILLED MORE HUMANS THAN WARS AND PLAGUE
trainval/cpsRAk5HpK4/50011 WE ARE GOING TO USE IT IN AND AROUND HUMANS
trainval/cpsRAk5HpK4/50012 IT HAS TO BE SAFE
trainval/cpsRAk5HpK4/50013 WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A LASTING IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT
trainval/cpsRAk5HpK4/50014 IT'S INVADED YOU
trainval/cpsRAk5HpK4/50015 IF THEY MATE SUCCESSFULLY THEN NO OFFSPRING
trainval/cpsRAk5HpK4/50016 SO WE'VE DONE FIELD TRIALS NOW IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS A SMALL ONE IN MALAYSIA AND TWO MORE
trainval/cpsRAk5HpK4/50017 IT'S NOT VERY EXPENSIVE BECAUSE IT'S A COFFEE CUP SOMETHING THE SIZE OF A COFFEE CUP WILL HOLD
trainval/cpsRAk5HpK4/50018 AND I'M IN FAVOR ACTUALLY
trainval/cpsRAk5HpK4/50019 OF COURSE I AM
trainval/CPVjktgYKo4/50002 THE THIRD THING WAS LOSS MAKING ENTERPRISES
trainval/CPVjktgYKo4/50004 SO WHAT HAS RWANDA SAID
trainval/CPVjktgYKo4/50005 OUR MANUFACTURING VALUE ADDED IS ONLY 11 PERCENT
trainval/CPVjktgYKo4/50006 FIRST AND FOREMOST IS INFRASTRUCTURE
trainval/CPVjktgYKo4/50007 AND ABOVE ALL WE HAVE TO ENGAGE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE
trainval/CPVjktgYKo4/50008 I SEE IT EVERY DAY
trainval/CPVjktgYKo4/50010 DO YOU FIND A WAY TO STAY ON AND FIGHT BACK
trainval/cQ3PWXoYIoE/50001 IT'S A CONVERSION OF MASS INTO ENERGY AND THAT'S EINSTEIN'S FAMOUS FORMULA E MC
trainval/cQ3PWXoYIoE/50002 AND THIS ENERGY IS RELEASED JUST BY SPEED BY KINETIC ENERGY BY HEAT IN OTHER
trainval/cQ3PWXoYIoE/50003 AND SO THAT'S A FANTASTIC FUEL
trainval/cQ3PWXoYIoE/50004 AND SO YOU CAN SAY
trainval/cQ3PWXoYIoE/50005 THAT'S OF COURSE A BIG BIG PROMISE
trainval/cQ3PWXoYIoE/50006 HOW TO MAKE IT HAPPEN
trainval/cQ3PWXoYIoE/50007 AND THIS BIG PROMISE HAS DRIVEN MANKIND FOR 50 YEARS ALREADY TO EXPLORE HOW IT CAN WORK
trainval/cQ3PWXoYIoE/50008 BUT I WILL ALSO ASK THE QUESTION
trainval/cQ3PWXoYIoE/50009 AND THE ANSWER IS NO BY NO MEANS
trainval/cQ3PWXoYIoE/50010 THE MACHINE RUNS PERFECTLY FINE
trainval/cQ3PWXoYIoE/50011 I THINK THAT WILL BE A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH AND THEN WE HAVE A NEW PRIMARY ENERGY SOURCE AND I SHOULD
trainval/CQ5dRyyHwfM/50001 THAT WAS MY POINT WITH THAT
trainval/CQ5dRyyHwfM/50002 THEY'VE GOT BETTER THINGS TO DO IN THE WILD
trainval/CqasLvlSWGU/50001 ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT CAN ALSO IMPACT THE MICROBIOME
trainval/CqasLvlSWGU/50002 YOU SEE TRADITIONALLY THE STUDY OF MICROBES HAD BEEN FOCUSED ON THE ROLE OF PATHOGENS THOSE
trainval/CqasLvlSWGU/50003 I THINK THAT THESE INTERACTIONS MAY HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE FOR US MAINTAINING OUR HUMAN MICROBIAL
trainval/cQgSjnOfHPQ/50001 IF WE KNOW THAT WE ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AREN'T A
trainval/cQgSjnOfHPQ/50002 WE HAVE THE GOALS
trainval/cQgSjnOfHPQ/50003 I SEE MYSELF AS A DISRUPTOR
trainval/Cqj0sgrNL10/50001 I HEARD ABOUT THINGS THAT WERE GOING WRONG IN THE LIVES OF THE POOR
trainval/Cqj0sgrNL10/50002 I HEARD ABOUT DISEASE I HEARD ABOUT WAR THEY ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE KIND OF RELATED
trainval/Cqj0sgrNL10/50003 BECAUSE THE BEST WAY FOR PEOPLE TO CHANGE THEIR LIVES IS FOR THEM TO HAVE CONTROL AND TO DO THAT IN A WAY THAT THEY BELIEVE IS BEST FOR
trainval/Cqj0sgrNL10/50004 THIS IS WHAT JESUS ASKED OF US
trainval/Cqj0sgrNL10/50005 IN FACT NO ONE WANTED ME TO FEEL BAD FOR THEM AT ALL
trainval/Cqj0sgrNL10/50006 IT'S ABOUT RETELLING THE STORY OF THE POOR AND IT'S ABOUT GIVING OURSELVES AN
trainval/Cqj0sgrNL10/50007 AND ALL OVER THE WORLD STILL NEED MONEY TO GROW AND TO DO MORE OF WHAT THEY WANT TO DO OR THEY MIGHT NEED MONEY DURING A HARD MONTH
trainval/Cqj0sgrNL10/50008 SO THAT THIS BELIEF IN EACH OTHER KNOWING THAT WITHOUT A DOUBT AND PRACTICING THAT EVERY DAY IN WHATEVER YOU
trainval/cQl6jUjFjp4/50001 SCANNING A BOOK IS LIKE TAKING A DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPH OF EVERY PAGE OF THE BOOK
trainval/cQl6jUjFjp4/50002 THAT IS DONE USING A TECNOLOGY CALLED OCR OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION WHICH TAKES A PICTURE OF TEXT AND TRIES TO
trainval/cQl6jUjFjp4/50003 SO I WOULD LIKE TO TRANSLATE ALL OF THE WEB OR AT LEAST MOST OF IT INTO EVERY MAJOR LANGUAGE
trainval/cQl6jUjFjp4/50004 UNFORTUNATELY IT'D BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE
trainval/cQl6jUjFjp4/50005 BUT AT ALL TIMES YOU ARE LEARNING BY DOING
trainval/cQvDUTOOkiI/50001 HE SAID THE WALL IT'S FALLING RIGHT NOW
trainval/cQvDUTOOkiI/50002 WE HOPPED IN HIS CAR WE DROVE AS FAST AS WE COULD TO THE WALL AND WE WERE PART OF THE
trainval/cQvDUTOOkiI/50003 THAT'S A GOVERNMENT RESTRICTION
trainval/cQvDUTOOkiI/50004 TO MY SURPRISE AND THE SURPRISE OF ALMOST EVERYONE RELIGION NOT ONLY
trainval/cQvDUTOOkiI/50005 I'VE PULLED THEM OUT OF THE CHART AND I'LL BLOW THEM UP TO REPRESENT THEIR POPULATION SIZE
trainval/cQvDUTOOkiI/50006 ONLY 4 DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE MUSLIM POPULATION HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED IN THE LAST DECADE FROM HALF A
trainval/cQvDUTOOkiI/50007 AND IF THEY DO SOCIAL VIOLENCE ALSO OFTEN RESULTS
trainval/cQvDUTOOkiI/50008 A TIME WHEN MANY HOPED THAT FREEDOM WOULD COME AS SPRING WOULD COME
trainval/cQvDUTOOkiI/50009 SO AGAIN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA STAND OUT ON THIS MEASURE AS HAVING 4 TIMES THE LEVEL
trainval/Cr1usGUSuL4/50001 BUT IT HAD HAPPENED TO BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT WITH ME
trainval/CR5krXHkr2I/50001 IT'S A GOOD AMOUNT OF WEIGHT DON'T YOU THINK
trainval/CR5krXHkr2I/50002 I DIDN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE IT AS MY OWN MISTAKE
trainval/cRrgDS4SD8s/50001 YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT BIG DATA IT'S A BUZZWORD THESE DAYS
trainval/cRrgDS4SD8s/50002 AND THAT'S WHAT BIG DATA CAN DO
trainval/cRrgDS4SD8s/50003 YOU TELL FACEBOOK WHERE YOU TOOK IT AND WHO TOOK IT
trainval/cRrgDS4SD8s/50005 AND THAT'S BECAUSE I'M NOT PROFESSIONAL THERE
trainval/cRrgDS4SD8s/50006 TRANSPARENT AND SO CALLED AUTHENTIC
trainval/cRrgDS4SD8s/50007 THAT'S WHAT HE IS WORKING AT
trainval/cRrgDS4SD8s/50008 THERE ARE SO MANY EASY THINGS TO DO AND I REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD DO IT NOW BEFORE YOU GET REALLY RICH AND
trainval/cRrgDS4SD8s/50009 WHY NOT DO THAT
trainval/cRrgDS4SD8s/50010 I MEAN YOU PUT IT ON YOUR FRONT DOOR
trainval/cRrgDS4SD8s/50011 BUT ALL OF US ARE ALWAYS DRIVING A BIT TOO FAST
trainval/cRrgDS4SD8s/50012 I THINK IT'S A TOO HIGH A PRICE TO PAY FOR YOUR PRIVACY AND BEING YOURSELF
trainval/cRrgDS4SD8s/50013 AND THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE USING COOKIES
trainval/cRrgDS4SD8s/50014 AND YOU PROBABLY TOLD THAT ON FACEBOOK
trainval/cRrgDS4SD8s/50015 AND CHILDREN ARE USED TO THAT
trainval/cRrgDS4SD8s/50016 BUT HOPEFULLY THERE WILL BE OTHERS THAN THE TRACKERS THEMSELVES
trainval/CrsdoIOGCRw/50001 FROM BOOKS TO TV SHOWS TO MAGAZINES YOU CAN'T EVEN CHECK OUT AT THE GROCERY STORE WITHOUT SEEING THE WORD
trainval/CrsdoIOGCRw/50002 THE CLOSETS THAT ARE OVERFLOWING THE GARAGES THAT CAN'T HOLD CARS THE STORAGE UNITS THAT HAVE BECOME
trainval/CrsdoIOGCRw/50003 AND PERHAPS THE POSTPONED DECISION IS
trainval/CrsdoIOGCRw/50004 WE PICK SOMETHING UP WE PUT IT BACK DOWN
trainval/CrsdoIOGCRw/50005 ONE PILE BECOMES TEN PILES AND THEN YOUR BOSS IS COMING IN OR YOU HAVE FRIENDS COMING OVER FOR DINNER AND YOU PUSH THEM
trainval/CrsdoIOGCRw/50006 YOU OPEN IT OPEN IT BUT YOU'RE NOT MAKING DECISIONS
trainval/CrsdoIOGCRw/50007 I HAD A VALVE DEFECT THAT I'D HAD MY WHOLE LIFE AND I HAD BEEN TOLD YOU'LL LIVE INTO
trainval/CrsdoIOGCRw/50008 I WAS THE MODEL PATIENT
trainval/CrsdoIOGCRw/50009 SOME ARE EASY
trainval/CrsdoIOGCRw/50011 NOW IT HAS TO HAVE AN ACTION JUST LIKE WITH THE PHYSICAL STUFF
trainval/CrsdoIOGCRw/50012 SOME CLUTTER IS GOING TO COME BACK BOTH THE PHYSICAL KIND THE EMOTIONAL KIND THAT'S CALLED LIFE IT'S GOING TO KEEP COMING
trainval/CrsdoIOGCRw/50013 AND SHE SAID YOU KEEP TELLING ME ABOUT IDEAS THAT YOU HAVE FOR YOUR BUSINESS AND THINGS YOU WANT TO
trainval/CrsdoIOGCRw/50014 YOU ARE STAYING STUCK ALSO
trainval/CrsdoIOGCRw/50015 NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL OF YOUR POSTPONED DECISIONS ARE IN SOME OF THOSE AREAS PERHAPS YOU ALSO
trainval/CRSLBcZgS84/50001 AND THESE OBJECTS ARE VISUALLY IDENTICAL BUT WHEN THE AVATAR CROSSES THE SURFACE OF THESE
trainval/CRSLBcZgS84/50002 AND THE FEEDBACK THAT COMES FROM THE AVATAR IS BEING PROCESSED DIRECTLY BY THE BRAIN WITHOUT THE INTERFERENCE OF THE
trainval/CRSLBcZgS84/50003 SO I WAS TOLD ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO THAT THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN
trainval/CS01Hmjv1pQ/50001 IT COULD BE LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE A U
trainval/CS9f7Qq4YZc/50001 THE GREAT THING ABOUT MELATONIN IS IT HAS GREAT ANTIOXIDANT QUALITIES THAT RID OUR BRAIN
trainval/CsECS5qsGLs/50001 CAN WE MAKE THEM SMARTER
trainval/CsECS5qsGLs/50002 OLD HUMAN BLOOD I DIDN'T SHOW YOU DOES NOT HAVE THIS EFFECT IT DOES NOT MAKE THE MICE YOUNGER
trainval/CsECS5qsGLs/50003 NOW I DON'T THINK WE WILL LIVE FOREVER
trainval/cSiNSQubRs0/50001 IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION IN THIS WORLD YOU HAVE IT WITH ONE OTHER PERSON
trainval/cSiNSQubRs0/50002 EVERY TIME A NEW CONSUMER JOINS THIS MEDIA LANDSCAPE A NEW PRODUCER JOINS AS WELL
trainval/cSiNSQubRs0/50003 PEOPLE WERE TEXTING FROM THEIR PHONES
trainval/cSiNSQubRs0/50009 I'VE CHANGED MY MIND
trainval/cSiNSQubRs0/50010 COM WITHIN WEEKS OF ITS BEING CREATED IT WAS THE LARGEST GROUP
trainval/CsjV1gjBMbQ/50001 WE'VE SEEN THAT IT CAN AFFECT MATTER AND CAUSE FORM WITHIN MATTER
trainval/CsjV1gjBMbQ/50002 WE CAN INSPIRE EACH OTHER
trainval/CSLy17buxlI/50001 HIGH SCHOOLERS WOULD BE GRADUATING WITH SO MUCH PASSION THEY WOULD KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO GET
trainval/CSLy17buxlI/50002 LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU MY 50 50 RULE
trainval/CSLy17buxlI/50003 BUT NO IT'S NOT RADIO
trainval/CSLy17buxlI/50004 BUT YOU JUST HAVEN'T FOUND IT YET
trainval/CSLy17buxlI/50005 ACTUALLY HOW MANY STUDENTS DO WE HAVE IN HERE
trainval/csnxJFQw98k/50001 THIS IS MOVING VERY FAST
trainval/csnxJFQw98k/50002 OR ULTIMATELY IS TECHNOLOGY THE POINT
trainval/csnxJFQw98k/50003 ARE WE MEANT TO CONFORM TO TECHNOLOGY
trainval/cSohjlYQI2A/50001 AND IF WE CAN TEACH LISTENING IN OUR SCHOOLS WE CAN TAKE OUR LISTENING OFF THAT SLIPPERY SLOPE TO THAT DANGEROUS
trainval/cSohjlYQI2A/50002 NOW THAT'S SOMETHING I FALL SHORT OF ON A DAILY BASIS
trainval/cSohjlYQI2A/50003 JUST THREE MINUTES A DAY OF SILENCE IS A WONDERFUL EXERCISE TO RESET YOUR EARS AND TO
trainval/CsqSDpmgsQg/50001 ANDREA LIVES ON THE ISLAND OF MADAGASCAR WHERE 95 PERCENT OF THE LOCAL PEOPLE ARE SUBSISTENCE
trainval/CsqSDpmgsQg/50002 HOW DO WE DEFINE WEALTH
trainval/CsqSDpmgsQg/50003 THE ISLAND INHABITS 23 MILLION PEOPLE WITH A THREE PERCENT GROWTH RATE
trainval/CsqSDpmgsQg/50004 HOWEVER ON THE OTHER HAND MADAGASCAR IS A PLACE OF INCREDIBLE WEALTH A WEALTH OF
trainval/CsqSDpmgsQg/50005 IS IT MONEY IN THE BANK
trainval/CsqSDpmgsQg/50006 NOW TODAY ACCORDING TO THE IUCN RED DATA LIST 91
trainval/CsqSDpmgsQg/50007 NOW SADLY BECAUSE OF THAT EXTREME POVERTY MANY OF THOSE LEMURS WERE HUNTED AND A LOT OF THE FOREST
trainval/CsqSDpmgsQg/50009 LEMUR HUNTING HAS DECREASED EDUCATION LEVELS ARE ON THE RISE AND LEMUR POPULATIONS ARE THRIVING IN
trainval/CsqSDpmgsQg/50010 NOW WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED IN LAVAVOLO I THOUGHT FOR SURE THIS IS THE POOREST REGION OF THE
trainval/CsqSDpmgsQg/50011 ALONG MY JOURNEY I HAVE COME TO FIND THAT THE POOREST PEOPLE THE ONES WITH THE LEAST AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS HAVE BEEN THE
trainval/CsqSDpmgsQg/50012 AS THEY MUST BE AS EACH DAY IS A STRUGGLE FOR MERE SURVIVAL
trainval/CsqSDpmgsQg/50013 AND AS I LOOK AROUND ME TODAY I SEE AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WEALTH RIGHT HERE A WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE
trainval/CsqSDpmgsQg/50014 THE KIDS IN LAVAVOLO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO BASIC EDUCATION
trainval/cSrWtqConY8/50001 WE EITHER SAW THE LAUNCHES FROM OUR BACKYARD OR WE SAW IT BY DRIVING IN THE HOUR OVER TO THE CAPE
trainval/cSrWtqConY8/50002 IT'S AN ENGINEER'S DREAM TO WORK WITH THAT GROUP OF PEOPLE
trainval/cSrWtqConY8/50003 AND I ALSO AT THE SAME TIME WANTED TO THANK MY FRIENDS AT GOOGLE BOTH FOR SUPPORTING ME DURING THIS EFFORT
trainval/CSSBGTJgBGo/50001 AND I'M TELLING A STORY THAT MANY OF YOU KNOW BECAUSE STEVE'S COLUMNS BECAME THE BASIS FOR A BOOK WHICH WAS
trainval/cSsxBTNF2U8/50001 SO AS SUSAN BOYLE WAS SAYING THAT 80000 LIVE AUDIENCE SANG TOGETHER
trainval/cSsxBTNF2U8/50002 I SUMMONED MY COURAGE AND POISE AND SAID YES BUT COULD YOU LET ME KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY DO YOU
trainval/cSsxBTNF2U8/50003 I WAS REPRESENTING THE SHANGHAI EXPO
trainval/cSsxBTNF2U8/50004 I SAW CHINA EMBRACING THE WORLD AND VICE VERSA
trainval/cSsxBTNF2U8/50005 FIRST OF ALL WHO ARE THEY
trainval/cSsxBTNF2U8/50006 AND ALSO IT SHOWED US THE POWER AND THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA AS MICROBLOG
trainval/cSsxBTNF2U8/50007 AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE READY TO GET MARRIED AND BUY THEIR APARTMENT THEY FIGURED OUT THEY HAVE TO WORK FOR 30
trainval/cSsxBTNF2U8/50008 THEY'RE NOT RICH AT ALL
trainval/CstD6O95LSo/50001 LOVE AND RESPECT THAT'S WHAT THE WHOLE FILM WAS ABOUT
trainval/CstD6O95LSo/50002 I REALIZED THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T AS GAY AS I WAS GAY BEING HAPPY NOT GAY BEING ATTRACTED TO THE SAME SEX
trainval/CstD6O95LSo/50003 I'LL WATCH THIS
trainval/CstD6O95LSo/50004 AND THEN HE REACHES INTO HIS POCKET AND HE BRINGS THIS OUT TO ME
trainval/CstD6O95LSo/50005 IT'S A WONDERFUL DAY IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY IT'S A WONDERFUL DAY IN THE GLOBE'S HISTORY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE AN ACTUAL SITTING
trainval/CstD6O95LSo/50006 HE WAS IN A MOVIE CALLED TORCH SONG TRILOGY
trainval/CstD6O95LSo/50007 AND I SAID TO MYSELF LZ FOR SO LONG YOU HAVE BEEN DENIED THIS
trainval/CstD6O95LSo/50008 I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SO CONFUSED I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SO UPSET
trainval/CstD6O95LSo/50009 IT'S VERY VERY FRUSTRATING AND I WAS FEELING LEFT OUT LIKE I WASN'T QUITE GAY ENOUGH
trainval/CSUmoS40pqA/50001 I HAD ABOUT TEN WOODEN SPOONS UNTIL I REALIZED THAT I ONLY HAVE TWO HANDS
trainval/CSUmoS40pqA/50002 THEY TELL US THAT FOR EACH APPLICATION WE NEED A DIFFERENT PRODUCT
trainval/CSUmoS40pqA/50003 THEY KEEP THE OTHER 80 FOR THE WHAT IF
trainval/CSUmoS40pqA/50004 A LIFE BASED ON EXPERIENCES INSTEAD OF THINGS
trainval/cswhOCKQZ7Q/50001 AND I WOULD SUBMIT THAT CLASSICAL MUSIC IS THE SECOND KIND
trainval/cswhOCKQZ7Q/50002 THERE'S THE SORT OF VAGUE SENSE THAT IT'S GOOD FOR US AND WE SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE MORE OF IT BUT IT'S ALSO KIND OF BORING
trainval/cswhOCKQZ7Q/50003 BUT WE CAN REALLY APPLY THIS NOT ONLY TO CLASSICAL MUSIC BUT TO MODERN POP MUSIC AND ANYTHING YOU WANT TO DO
trainval/cswhOCKQZ7Q/50004 SO WHY IS THIS SO HARD
trainval/cswhOCKQZ7Q/50005 BUT THERE'S TWO KINDS OF BORING
trainval/cswhOCKQZ7Q/50006 AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE ALSO BOTH A SECTIONS
trainval/cswhOCKQZ7Q/50007 AND IN MUSIC THEORY WE CALL THIS A BINARY FORM
trainval/cswhOCKQZ7Q/50008 BINARY BECAUSE IT HAS TWO BASIC PARTS TO IT
trainval/cswhOCKQZ7Q/50009 AND IF YOU'RE FEELING REALLY GENEROUS TO THE CURE YOU CAN SAY
trainval/cswhOCKQZ7Q/50010 IN FACT YOU CAN HAVE 3 PARTS AND THAT'S A CLASSIC POP SONG
trainval/cswhOCKQZ7Q/50011 IT'S SORT OF EXPLODING IT'S STRETCHING OUT THE PIECE AND BY THE END THE STRUCTURE ENTIRELY FALLS APART
trainval/cswhOCKQZ7Q/50012 IT'S A VERY ANGRY SONG THAT'S SORT OF EXPLODING IN THE MIDDLE AND IT COLLAPSES THE STRUCTURE OF THE SONG
trainval/cswhOCKQZ7Q/50013 IF YOU LISTEN TO IT AGAIN I THINK YOU MIGHT HEAR IT THIS WAY
trainval/cswhOCKQZ7Q/50014 ALL RIGHT SO MUSIC HAS STRUCTURE
trainval/cswhOCKQZ7Q/50015 BUT THIS STUFF INTRODUCES A TON OF NEW STUFF
trainval/cswhOCKQZ7Q/50016 THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT I THINK MORE CHALLENGING BUT ALSO IN SOME WAYS MORE REWARDING
trainval/cswhOCKQZ7Q/50017 THEY ARE ALL RELATED TO EACH OTHER
trainval/cswhOCKQZ7Q/50018 YOU CAN HAVE ONE THING GROW AND THEN BECOME THE BASIS OF AN ENTIRE SYMPHONY
trainval/cswhOCKQZ7Q/50019 AND THAT IS ALSO WHY MUSIC REPEATS BECAUSE IT WANTS TO SHOW YOU THE STRUCTURE
trainval/cswhOCKQZ7Q/50020 THE COMPOSER IS SAYING
trainval/cswhOCKQZ7Q/50021 WHAT YOU JUST HEARD WAS A STRUCTURE
trainval/cswhOCKQZ7Q/50022 AND HERE IT IS AGAIN SO YOU CAN GET FAMILIAR WITH IT BECAUSE IN A SECOND I'M GOING TO PLAY WITH IT
trainval/cswhOCKQZ7Q/50023 AND IF YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE YOU KNOW THOSE CHANGES ARE GOING TO BE MEANINGFUL
trainval/cswhOCKQZ7Q/50024 I WISH THERE WERE A CHEAP FIX LIKE THAT
trainval/CTEhgUmSrro/50001 I ENDED UP WITH BLUNT CHEST TRAUMA
trainval/CTEhgUmSrro/50002 YOUR AORTA COMES UP BEHIND YOUR HEART IT'S YOUR MAJOR ARTERY AND IT WAS SEVERED SO MY
trainval/CTEhgUmSrro/50003 SOMEHOW I ENDED UP AT THE HOSPITAL
trainval/CTEhgUmSrro/50004 I WAS WRAPPED IN ICE AND THEN EVENTUALLY PUT INTO A DRUG INDUCED COMA
trainval/CTEhgUmSrro/50005 SOME THINGS WORKED SOME THINGS DIDN'T
trainval/CTEhgUmSrro/50006 BUT EVENTUALLY I STARTED TO LOOK HUMAN AGAIN
trainval/CTEhgUmSrro/50007 I HAD MORE THAN 50 SURGERIES
trainval/CTEhgUmSrro/50008 I HAD NO IDEA THAT AT THAT MOMENT MY LIFE WAS GOING TO CHANGE FOREVER
trainval/CTEhgUmSrro/50009 AND I KNOW ALL OF YOU ARE SCRATCHING YOUR HEAD A SENIOR CITIZENS' HOME
trainval/CTEhgUmSrro/50010 WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU GOING TO DO THERE
trainval/CTEhgUmSrro/50011 SO THERE WERE ALL THESE SKILLS AND TALENTS THAT THESE SENIORS HAD
trainval/CTEhgUmSrro/50012 BUT ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THEY NEEDED TO DO WAS ASSESS WHAT I NEEDED RIGHT AWAY
trainval/CTEhgUmSrro/50013 SO I HAD TO GO THROUGH TRYING TO EAT AGAIN
trainval/CTEhgUmSrro/50014 AND THEN THEY HAD TO FIGURE OUT WELL SHE NEEDS FURNITURE
trainval/CTEhgUmSrro/50015 WE'RE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE HAIRSTYLES THEY TRIED TO FORCE ON ME ONCE MY HAIR GREW BACK
trainval/CTEhgUmSrro/50016 THEY WERE GOING TO MAKE IT FUN FOR ME
trainval/CTEhgUmSrro/50017 SO I MOVED ON FROM THERE
trainval/CTEhgUmSrro/50018 AND AS A BLIND PERSON YOUR VISUAL MEMORY FADES AND IS REPLACED WITH
trainval/CTEhgUmSrro/50019 BUT WHEN YOU'RE BLIND YOU HAVE THE TACTILE MEMORY FOR THINGS
trainval/CTEhgUmSrro/50020 SO THERE WERE TWO OBSTACLES I HAD TO GET THROUGH
trainval/CTEhgUmSrro/50021 I WOULDN'T BE STANDING HERE TODAY IF IT WASN'T FOR EXTREME RADICAL COLLABORATION
trainval/CtvIX4s1bTU/50001 ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO ENSURE THAT WE WILL HAVE THE FOOD SUPPLIES AND THE AIR THAT WE NEED IS TO BRING WITH US
trainval/CtvIX4s1bTU/50002 WHILE MARS AND ALL THE MOVIES MADE IN ITS NAME HAVE REINVIGORATED THE ETHOS FOR SPACE TRAVEL
trainval/Ctz4E2ARkCg/50001 IT TOOK MONTHS AND MONTHS AND HUNDREDS OF E MAILS AND HUNDREDS OF PHONE CONVERSATIONS AND ALL THIS RUNNING AROUND
trainval/Ctz4E2ARkCg/50002 A FEW YEARS I MIGHT DO PHYSICS THEN I MIGHT DO ECONOMICS I MIGHT DO THEATER I MIGHT DO DANCE
trainval/Ctz4E2ARkCg/50003 WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HIM HE FOUND THE BEST POSSIBLE STORY TO TELL ABOUT THAT THE MOST USEFUL STORY TO HIM
trainval/Ctz4E2ARkCg/50004 NOT MUCH TO THE PLOT
trainval/Ctz4E2ARkCg/50005 WITH THE SAME PLOT WITH THE SAME EVENTS I CAN TELL ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STORIES
trainval/Ctz4E2ARkCg/50006 BUT THERE IS ANOTHER WAY THERE IS MANY OTHER WAYS
trainval/Ctz4E2ARkCg/50007 THERE IS A LOT OF VALUE TO BE GAINED BY BECOMING A STORYTELLER AND REALIZING THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
trainval/Ctz4E2ARkCg/50008 NOW THIS FUNNY THING HAPPENED
trainval/Cu3ILSqFJJQ/50001 NOW DON'T LET ALL OF THIS SCARE YOU AWAY FROM OLIVE OIL
trainval/Cu3ILSqFJJQ/50002 IT STARTS WITH THE GROWING AND THE HARVESTING OF OLIVES AND IT INVOLVES EVERYTHING IT INVOLVES EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO THE
trainval/Cu3ILSqFJJQ/50003 OLIVE OIL GROWN IN MANY PLACES AROUND THE WORLD
trainval/Cu3ILSqFJJQ/50004 SOME PEOPLE FALSELY BELIEVE THAT OLIVE OIL ONLY COMES FROM A CERTAIN REGION
trainval/Cu3ILSqFJJQ/50005 GOOD OLIVE OIL ONLY COMES FROM A CERTAIN REGION
trainval/Cu3ILSqFJJQ/50006 AS EACH BREAKDOWN POTENTIALLY EXPOSES IT TO MORE AND MORE OXYGEN
trainval/CV3XRRQB9PM/50001 ONE WINTER DAY A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS SITTING AT MY KITCHEN TABLE WRITING ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED
trainval/CV3XRRQB9PM/50002 I KNOW THIS NOW
trainval/Cv8ttNerBEg/50001 IT WAS IRONIC BECAUSE I WAS A GUY TALKING EVERYDAY ABOUT REDUCING PEOPLE'S RELIANCE ON DIESEL AWARDED
trainval/CVaSIZVzUoc/50001 THESE FIELDS ARE COMPUTATIONAL DESIGN ALLOWING US TO DESIGN COMPLEX FORMS WITH
trainval/CVdPhUPO5YU/50001 SO THAT'S WHAT WE DO
trainval/CVdPhUPO5YU/50002 IN FACT BECAUSE WE'RE USING THE WATER BOATMAN AS INSPIRATION AND OUR ROBOT SITS ON TOP OF THE WATER
trainval/CVdPhUPO5YU/50004 THIS IS ITS STOMACH
trainval/CVdPhUPO5YU/50005 SO WHAT IS IT
trainval/CVdPhUPO5YU/50006 THIS IS SLIGHTLY NEWER
trainval/CVdPhUPO5YU/50007 NOT ONLY THAT BUT IF YOU SELECT THE RIGHT KIND OF MICROBES YOU CAN USE THE MICROBIAL FUEL CELL TO
trainval/CVdPhUPO5YU/50008 IF YOU CHOOSE THE RIGHT MICROBES THE MICROBES WILL EAT THE ALGAE
trainval/CVdPhUPO5YU/50009 BUT WE CAN'T FORCE THE MICROBES AND THEY GENERATE A SMALL AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY PER SECOND
trainval/CVdPhUPO5YU/50010 HOW CAN WE COPE WITH THAT
trainval/CVdPhUPO5YU/50011 WE COULD SEND A MESSAGE SAYING THIS IS HOW MUCH POLLUTION I'VE EATEN RECENTLY OR THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFF THAT I'VE ENCOUNTERED
trainval/CVdPhUPO5YU/50012 SO WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF THESE ROBOTS INSTEAD OF BEING LIKE THIS MADE OUT OF PLASTIC WERE MADE OUT OF OTHER MATERIALS WHICH
trainval/CVdPhUPO5YU/50013 JUST SPREAD THEM AROUND
trainval/CVdPhUPO5YU/50014 WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IS YOU CAN USE HOUSEHOLD MATERIALS TO MAKE THESE BIODEGRADABLE ROBOTS
trainval/CVdPhUPO5YU/50015 WELL THIS IS REALLY REALLY EXCITING
trainval/CVdPhUPO5YU/50016 IT'S GOING TO TOTALLY CHANGE THE WAY IN WHICH WE THINK ABOUT ROBOTS BUT ALSO IT ALLOWS YOU TO BE REALLY CREATIVE IN THE WAY
trainval/cVSg6uQfllk/50001 THEY CAN STAY HOME AND TAKE CARE OF ANYBODY'S CHILDREN
trainval/cWCSzDdF74s/50001 I'D BEEN ROUND THE BACK
trainval/cWCSzDdF74s/50002 IT HAS BEEN A SUCCESS STORY
trainval/cWCSzDdF74s/50003 WE START OUT WITH NINE
trainval/cWCSzDdF74s/50004 SUPERMARKETS ARE AN EASY PLACE TO START
trainval/cWCSzDdF74s/50005 I WAS SITTING IN A ROADSIDE CAFE
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50001 IT IS EVEN AHEAD OF DRUGS
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50002 HUMAN BEINGS ARE BEING SOLD AND RESOLD AND RESOLD IT FETCHES 32 BILLION
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50003 FOR ALL YOU KNOW YOU MAY BE SITTING AMONGST PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TRAFFICKED BEFORE AND YOU WOULD NOT EVEN KNOW IT
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50004 BEIRUT BOSNIA SOMALIA BAGHDAD THE WORKS
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50005 EVERYTHING WAS FINE BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN I WAS GETTING MY THRILLS MY ADRENALINE UPS HIGHS LOWS
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50006 BUT SYMBOLICALLY WHAT HAPPENED
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50007 SO WE CO PRODUCED WITH THE HELP OF AN ORGANIZATION CALLED AMP QUOT END HUMAN TRAFFICKING NOW AMP QUOT A SIX PART SERIES FOR THE
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50008 WE CANNOT EVEN BEGIN TO START TO TELL YOU THE STORIES BECAUSE THEY ARE SO HORRIFIC BUT IN THESE CLIPS YOU MIGHT JUST GET AN IDEA
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50009 IN THE AGE OF WONDERMENT THAT IS MY QUESTION THAT IN THE 21ST CENTURY WHY ARE WE ALLOWING
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50010 IT EXISTS IN A BIG WAY
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50011 THERE ARE AT LEAST 27 MILLION SLAVES IN THIS WORLD TODAY 27 MILLION
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50012 HE WAS THE POWERFUL ONE
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50013 THAT AMP X27 S FAR MORE THAN THE SLAVES THAT WERE TRANSPORTED OUT OF AFRICA OVER A PERIOD OF 400 YEARS
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50014 SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING AS A NANNY SHE TURNED OUT TO BE A DOMESTIC SLAVE
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50015 SHE GOT SOLD FROM ONE FAMILY TO ANOTHER THEN ANOTHER WOMAN STARTED MAKING HER SHORT SKIRTS AND THINGS LIKE
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50016 AS A RESULT THAT OWNER AND I WON'T SAY EMPLOYER IT WAS THE OWNER PUSHED HER OFF THE THIRD FLOOR
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50017 AND AS SHE IS FALLING YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT'S GOING THROUGH HER MIND
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50018 SHE'S TRYING TO TELL US AND SHE IS SAYING I LOOK DOWN AND I SAY HOW DO I ROTATE MYSELF WHAT DO I DO
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50019 SO MANY PEOPLE ARE SOLD INTO SLAVERY BY PEOPLE IN WHOM THEY HAVE PLACED TRUST
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50020 HER OWNER WENT SCOT FREE
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50021 BECAUSE THE OWNER PRETENDED TO THE POLICE THAT THIS WOMAN WAS TRYING TO RUN AWAY SHE PACKED ALL THE CLOTHES IN BAGS AND PUT THEM OUT
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50022 SO WHEN THE POLICE CAME SHE SAID SHE FELL WHEN SHE WAS TRYING TO RUN AWAY
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50023 MUCH CLOSER TO HOME WE SAW THIS LADY FROM THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING UNIT IN MEXICO
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50024 HERE WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50025 THE I 10 CORRIDOR FROM EL PASO TO HOUSTON IS THE LARGEST CORRIDOR FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50026 A GUY WHO'S GOT A GIRL AND A BOY COUSINS AND HE'S SELLING THEM VERY HAPPY VERY HAPPY TO SELL THEM TO OUR
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50027 AND WHAT HAPPENS SOME OF THESE ARE JUST SIMPLE DISPUTES WHERE PEOPLE LEAVE HOME
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50028 AND SOMEBODY BEFRIENDS THEM BECOMES A BOYFRIEND MAKES THEM FEEL GOOD
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50029 WE LOOK AT THE BOY IN INDIA
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50030 THEY ARE IN THE A CAPELLA VOICE CHOIR
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50031 WE HAD OUR CREWS COVER SOME RAIDS WHERE THE POLICE ACTUALLY FREED SOME OF THESE KIDS
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50032 AND THE SAME STORY IS REPEATED NOT JUST THE CHURCH
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50033 AND THAT COULDN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE THE PARENTS WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME ACCEPTING THAT THIS WAS YOUR TICKET TO FREEDOM TO
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50034 SO IN THAT WAY THE KIDS WERE FORCED TO WORK INCREDIBLE HOURS NO BREAKS NO NOTHING
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50035 SHE FOUGHT THE SYSTEM AND MADE SURE THAT HE HAD A SAFE HOME HERE
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50036 BUT IT ISN AMP X27 T SAFE FOR EVERYBODY
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50037 A LOT OF THE KIDS THAT WENT BACK BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T COPE WITH ALL OF THIS WHEN THERE WAS ALCOHOLISM OR DRUGS OR VIOLENCE
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50038 WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50039 WE CAN ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS ASK PEOPLE WHO MAKE OUR GARMENTS ARE THESE GARMENTS
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50040 THEY WANT YOUR MONEY THEY WILL LISTEN
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50041 ASK THE CHOCOLATE MANUFACTURERS IS THIS SLAVE LABOR CHILD LABOR FROM WEST AFRICA
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50042 ASK THEM AND THEY WILL LISTEN
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50043 YOU CAN CALL HOTLINES THAT ARE SET UP
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50044 AND ALL OF THIS CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50045 ALL OF US CAN REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE
trainval/cWcVPpxezE0/50046 IF YOU THINK YOU CANNOT MAKE A DIFFERENCE THAT AMP X27 S WRONG
trainval/CWCWq155hyc/50001 WELL TAKE 0
trainval/CWCWq155hyc/50002 KEEP IN MIND THE EXAM IS WEDNESDAY NIGHT OK
trainval/CWCWq155hyc/50003 IT WAS A MESS ERASER MARKS EVERYWHERE STUFF SCRATCHED OUT BUT 5
trainval/cWpRxyqDgpM/50001 IT SEEMED TO BE ABOUT RIGHT BUT I COULDN'T QUITE TELL
trainval/cWpRxyqDgpM/50002 AFTER 30 HOURS IN THE LAB I PROBABLY SMELLED HORRIBLE
trainval/CwpvSWtUP3o/50001 IT SHOULD BE SO EXCITING TO BE OUT IN THE WORLD TO BE FREE
trainval/CwpvSWtUP3o/50002 TAKE A MOMENT AND THINK ABOUT OUR GOOD FRIEND DOROTHY FROM THE WIZARD OF OZ
trainval/CwpvSWtUP3o/50004 I SAID THAT WOULD BE GREAT BECAUSE I DID THIS 25 YEARS AGO
trainval/CWU13rx44j8/50001 TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR MANY YEARS AFTER THAT I WOULD GO TO THE LATE NIGHT
trainval/CWU13rx44j8/50002 SO I PUT TOGETHER THIS DETAILED SYLLABUS I HAD OVERHEADS WITH EVERYTHING THAT YOU COULD
trainval/CWU13rx44j8/50003 AND FOR DECADES NEUROSCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN FIGURING OUT THE ANATOMY AND THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE BRAIN
trainval/CWU13rx44j8/50004 AND AS A TEACHER I WAS USING ONE
trainval/CWU13rx44j8/50005 HIPPO CAMPUS RIGHT
trainval/CWU13rx44j8/50007 THAT IS FANTASTIC
trainval/CWU13rx44j8/50008 SHE TOLD ME THE SAME DAY THAT HUMMUS IS MADE UP OF GROUND UP HUMMINGBIRDS
trainval/CWU13rx44j8/50009 BUT SOME OF THEM ARE RED HOT FIVE STARS
trainval/CWU13rx44j8/50010 IT'S HOW YOU FLAVOR IT HOW THE EMOTION IS ADDED TO IT
trainval/CWU13rx44j8/50011 THESE GUYS WE WOULD GO HEAD TO HEAD AND THEY WOULD CRUSH US
trainval/CWU13rx44j8/50012 IN MY CLASS EVERYTHING IS ON THE BOARD
trainval/CWU13rx44j8/50013 I DRAW EVERYTHING AND IT'S IN REAL TIME AND EVERYBODY DRAWS
trainval/CWU13rx44j8/50014 DAVID WIRTSHAFTER AND HIS WIFE WALKING DOWN MICHIGAN AVENUE
trainval/CWU13rx44j8/50015 AND I HAD A LITTLE BIT OF TREPIDATION ABOUT WALKING UP TO HIM BECAUSE HE HAD RETIRED EARLY
trainval/CWU13rx44j8/50016 AND I SAID I KNEW THAT
trainval/CWU13rx44j8/50017 BECAUSE OF THEIR BASAL GANGLIA AND THEIR CEREBELLUM
trainval/CWU13rx44j8/50018 AND HE GOES ROSE
trainval/CWU13rx44j8/50019 IT'S TRUE IT MAKES SENSE BUT IT'S SURPRISING
trainval/CWU13rx44j8/50020 MAYBE WE'RE GOING TO WIN MAYBE WE'RE NOT
trainval/CWU13rx44j8/50021 THE POWER OF MAYBE
trainval/CWU13rx44j8/50022 AND AS YOU PRACTICE THE BASAL GANGLIA AND THE CEREBELLUM MAKE YOU BETTER
trainval/CWU13rx44j8/50023 DID I HEAR A CLICK
trainval/CWU13rx44j8/50024 WAS THAT THE FUEL PUMP THAT CLICKED IN
trainval/CWU13rx44j8/50025 IT IS A LEARNING CIRCUIT
trainval/CWU13rx44j8/50026 THE POWER OF MAYBE
trainval/CWU13rx44j8/50027 AS A TEACHER HOW DO YOU DO THIS
trainval/CWU13rx44j8/50028 WELL STUDENTS ARE VETERANS OF THE CLASSROOM SO I CERTAINLY DON'T HELP
trainval/cWYcXhMhJF4/50001 THE NUMBER OF NATURAL DISASTERS HAS ACTUALLY DOUBLED
trainval/cWYcXhMhJF4/50002 2 TRILLION DOLLARS DUE TO DAMAGE
trainval/cWYcXhMhJF4/50003 AND IT'S GETTING MORE DIFFICULT
trainval/cWYcXhMhJF4/50004 WE HAVE MORE AND MORE DISASTERS
trainval/cWYcXhMhJF4/50005 CLIMATE CHANGE IS ADDING TO UNCERTAINTY AND WE HAVE A PATH OF URBANIZATION THAT THIS
trainval/cWYcXhMhJF4/50006 WE NEED ACTION IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR WE NEED FRAMEWORKS IN PUBLIC POLICY WE NEED AWARENESS AND INVESTMENT IN THE
trainval/cWYcXhMhJF4/50007 DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT IS IN THE BUILDING CODE IN JAPAN DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT IN THE BUILDING CODE IS
trainval/cWYcXhMhJF4/50008 SHE WAS BORN AT THE BEGINNING OF ONE WORLD WAR LIVED THROUGH A SECOND AND SURVIVED POLIO
trainval/cWYcXhMhJF4/50009 IN 2010 WHEN HURRICANE TOMAS HIT THE ISLAND UNFORTUNATELY MANY COMMUNITIES
trainval/cWYcXhMhJF4/50010 SO FOR EXAMPLE CHANGING THE HEIGHTS OF ROADS AND THINGS LIKE THIS
trainval/cWYcXhMhJF4/50011 SO THIS PORT COMPANY WAS ABLE TO SEE THE BENEFIT FROM INVESTING IN THEIR
trainval/cWYcXhMhJF4/50012 WE KNOW THAT IN FACT THOSE STRONG SOCIAL BONDS ARE ONE OF THE STRONGEST DETERMINANTS OF RESILIENCE WITHIN THE
trainval/cWYcXhMhJF4/50013 I MEAN IT MAKES INTUITIVE SENSE NEIGHBOURS KNOW WHICH NEIGHBOUR NEEDS HELP WHICH NEIGHBOUR IS
trainval/cWYcXhMhJF4/50014 WE ALSO KNOW THAT FAMILIES NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS ARE THE ONES THAT HELP RECONSTRUCT
trainval/cWYcXhMhJF4/50015 AND SO WHEN WE THINK OF RESILIENCE THIS IS NOT AN ADAPT CONSTRUCT IT'S NOT JUST A
trainval/cWYcXhMhJF4/50016 RESILIENCE IS BOTH THE NEED FOR PUBLIC POLICY AND THE NEED FOR
trainval/cWYcXhMhJF4/50017 I THINK THE PEOPLE OF JAPAN KNOW THAT
trainval/cXbXNV9SZAg/50001 I WAS WAY TOO YOUNG TO SEE IT BUT I WAS CAUGHT UP IN JAWS FEVER LIKE EVERYONE ELSE IN AMERICA AT THE TIME
trainval/cXbXNV9SZAg/50002 I'M THINKING ARE YOU KIDDING
trainval/cXbXNV9SZAg/50003 I'M WEARING A SUIT OF ARMOR
trainval/cXbXNV9SZAg/50004 I MADE A LOT OF MY OWN TOYS
trainval/cXbXNV9SZAg/50005 I'LL DRESS AS NEO FROM THE MATRIX
trainval/cXbXNV9SZAg/50006 THEY'VE WORKED HARD ON THEIR POSE TO MAKE THEIR COSTUME LOOK GREAT FOR YOUR CAMERA
trainval/cXbXNV9SZAg/50007 AND WE'RE MAKING IT OUR OWN
trainval/cxGWGohIXiw/50003 THERE D BE A POMPOUS PAPER PARLIAMENT WHO REMAINED OUT OF TOUCH AND WHO IGNORED THE PEOPLE'S PROTESTS ABOUT ALL THE PAPER CUTS THEN
trainval/cxGWGohIXiw/50004 TAKES JUST UNDER A MINUTE TO WORK OUT THAT IT S BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT HE SLEPT
trainval/cxGWGohIXiw/50005 WHILE SHE MAINTAINED THE STRICT VIEWS IMPOSED ON HER BY HER MOTHER THAT SEPARATE COULD NOT BE EQUAL
trainval/cxGWGohIXiw/50006 AND THOUGH AT THE TIME HE FELT STUPID AND DUMB FOR TRYING TO LOVE A GIRL CONTROLLED BY HER STUPID MUM HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMFORTED BY THE SIMPLE SUM
trainval/cxGWGohIXiw/50007 HE RECKONED SHE WOULD LIKE HIM IF SHE KNEW HE WAS LIKE HER AND IT WAS DIFFERENT THIS TIME
trainval/cxGWGohIXiw/50008 I MEAN THIS GIRL WAS WICKED SO HE PLUCKED UP THE COURAGE AND ASKED FOR HER DIGITS
trainval/cxGWGohIXiw/50009 AND WHAT IT ALSO MEANS IS YOU CAN WIN
trainval/cxGWGohIXiw/50010 MAYBE POP UP PURPLE PAPER PEOPLE
trainval/cxGWGohIXiw/50011 BUT I WOULDN T WANNA DEAL WITH ALL THE PAPER PEOPLE POLITICS
trainval/cXQrbxD9SNg/50001 WE'RE GOING TO CALL THAT GUY BILL
trainval/cXQrbxD9SNg/50002 THE SOCIETAL ONE IS A LOT MORE CHALLENGING
trainval/cXQrbxD9SNg/50003 I STARTED MY TALK WITH QUOTES FROM WORDSMITHS WHO WERE SEPARATED BY AN OCEAN AND A CENTURY
trainval/CXSKrxq5eUI/50001 I MEAN IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED SYSTEM
trainval/CXSKrxq5eUI/50002 SOMEONE MUST CONTROL ALL OF THIS
trainval/CXSKrxq5eUI/50003 NO ONE IS IN CHARGE
trainval/CXSKrxq5eUI/50005 YOU REALLY REDUCE CONGESTION QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY
trainval/CXSKrxq5eUI/50006 BUT WELL AS I SAID I MEAN CAR DRIVERS ADAPT RIGHT
trainval/CXSKrxq5eUI/50007 I MEAN THINK ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT CITIES ARE ACTUALLY
trainval/CXSKrxq5eUI/50008 SO WHY CAN THAT BE
trainval/CXSKrxq5eUI/50009 AND WHY IS THAT
trainval/CXSKrxq5eUI/50010 IT'S BECAUSE THAT TRAVEL PATTERNS ARE MUCH LESS STABLE THAN YOU MIGHT THINK
trainval/CXSKrxq5eUI/50011 EACH DAY PEOPLE MAKE NEW DECISIONS AND PEOPLE CHANGE AND THE WORLD CHANGES AROUND THEM AND EACH DAY ALL OF
trainval/CXvUdCdKTJY/50001 TRISTAN A WEST POINT TRACK STAR WHO ALWAYS RAN AND ROAD MARCHED WITH NO SOCKS
trainval/cyBeRNOxNBk/50001 THOUGH I EVENTUALLY CAME TO THE REALIZATION THAT I NEEDED TO RAISE THIS COMPANY ON MY OWN
trainval/cyBeRNOxNBk/50002 AS DAUNTING AS IT MAY BE IT'S ABOUT DOING SOMETHING BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE
trainval/CycOuSVQOnM/50001 HE DIED OF THESE COMPLICATIONS AT THE AGE OF 50
trainval/CycOuSVQOnM/50002 WE NEED MORE
trainval/CycOuSVQOnM/50004 I'M FINE WITH MY INSULIN
trainval/CycOuSVQOnM/50005 THAT'S WHERE THE DISCOVERIES ARE MADE
trainval/CyElHdaqkjo/50001 IN FACT I'M NOT VERY INTERESTED IN PARENTING PER SE
trainval/CyElHdaqkjo/50002 YOU GOTTA SAY WHAT WAS GREAT ABOUT LUNCH TODAY
trainval/CyElHdaqkjo/50003 THEY NEED TO KNOW THEY MATTER TO US AS HUMANS NOT BECAUSE OF THEIR GPA
trainval/CyElHdaqkjo/50004 I'VE GOT TWO KIDS I MENTIONED SAWYER AND AVERY
trainval/CyElHdaqkjo/50005 AND ONCE UPON A TIME I THINK I WAS TREATING MY SAWYER AND AVERY LIKE LITTLE BONSAI
trainval/CyKmpyYy14k/50001 ON THE BANK'S TIME
trainval/CyKmpyYy14k/50003 I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE TO BEGIN
trainval/CyKmpyYy14k/50004 I GET THAT FOR NEWBIES THAT MAY BE A LITTLE BIT EXTREME
trainval/CyKmpyYy14k/50005 YOU'RE HAPPY IN THE MOMENT SURE BUT THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE THE THRILL IS IN THE CHASE
trainval/CyKmpyYy14k/50006 POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY EXPERT DR
trainval/CypPMzZinys/50001 NOW BOB IS A VERY HARDWORKING INDIVIDUAL
trainval/CypPMzZinys/50002 THEY CAME UP WITH A BIG RECORD WHICH WOULD SAY EXACTLY WHO OWNED WHAT WHICH THEY KEPT BEHIND
trainval/CypPMzZinys/50003 THERE'S A LOT OF POWER INVOLVED AND PEOPLE ARE UNDERSTANDABLY ATTACHED TO MONEY IT'S ONE OF MAN'S
trainval/CypPMzZinys/50004 WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THERE'S A SHIFT FROM CENTRALIZED BUREAUCRATIC HIERARCHIES
trainval/CypPMzZinys/50005 THINK OF MEDIA THINK OF THE TELEVISION AND THE NEWS SERVICES THAT WE EXPECT
trainval/CypPMzZinys/50006 AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE A SELF DRIVING CAR
trainval/CypPMzZinys/50007 THINK OF THE CAPACITY THAT INDIVIDUALS THAT FAMILIES THE COMMUNITIES HAVE NOW THE POTENTIAL TO WORK
trainval/CypPMzZinys/50008 AND YOU MIGHT SAY
trainval/CypPMzZinys/50009 HOW WILL THEY ADOPT THE TECHNOLOGY
trainval/cZ7LzE3u7Bw/50001 IT HAS LOWER TAXES
trainval/cZ7LzE3u7Bw/50002 WE WORRY MORE ABOUT HOW WE'RE JUDGED AND SEEN BY OTHERS WHETHER WE'RE REGARDED AS ATTRACTIVE
trainval/cZ7LzE3u7Bw/50003 WE SPEND A GOOD BIT OF TIME
trainval/CzgS9C7gw0o/50001 I WAS DISTRACTED IN CONVERSATION
trainval/CzgS9C7gw0o/50002 I WAS SEEING THESE GORGEOUS SIGHTS JASPER HAD TO OFFER AND MY FIRST REACTION WAS TO TAKE OUT MY PHONE AND POST IT ON
trainval/CzgS9C7gw0o/50003 ANYTHING WE DO THIS OFTEN IS WORTHY OF CRITICAL OBSERVATION
trainval/CzgS9C7gw0o/50004 WHY AM I JUST SITTING HERE IN MY PJ'S WATCHING NETFLIX
trainval/CzgS9C7gw0o/50005 WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THESE EVERYDAY INSTANCES AS WELL
trainval/CzgS9C7gw0o/50006 DOESN'T THAT SOUND LIKE EVERY DRUG YOU HAVE EVER HEARD OF
trainval/CzgS9C7gw0o/50007 HEARING WHAT I'VE SAID TODAY MIGHT MAKE YOU THINK I WANT YOU TO GET OFF OF IT
trainval/CzgS9C7gw0o/50008 BUT I DON'T
trainval/CzgS9C7gw0o/50009 I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING ANYWHERE SO I'M NOT GOING TO WASTE MY TIME TELLING YOU TO SPEND LESS TIME ON
trainval/CzgS9C7gw0o/50010 IT'S JUST THE MOST RECENT TOOL WE USE TO DO WHAT WE HAVE ALWAYS DONE
trainval/CzgS9C7gw0o/50011 THAT DARK SIDE THAT LOOKS AT A PICTURE OF A HAPPY FAMILY AND WONDERS WHY YOURS DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THAT
trainval/CzgS9C7gw0o/50012 DID THAT FACEBOOK SCROLL MAKE ME FEEL BETTER OR WORSE OFF
trainval/CzgS9C7gw0o/50013 HOW MANY TIMES DO I ACTUALLY CHECK LIKES
trainval/CzgS9C7gw0o/50014 IT'S JUST ONE PHOTO IT'S FUNNY
trainval/CzgS9C7gw0o/50015 WE ARE TAUGHT TO RESPECT OTHERS AND TREAT THEM HOW THEY DESERVE
trainval/CZNrOzgNWf4/50001 AND SOME OF THEM MANY OF THEM ACTUALLY HAD WATER THAT CAME INTO MORE THAN ONE ROOM
trainval/CZNrOzgNWf4/50002 WHO IS INFECTING OTHER PEOPLE
trainval/CZNrOzgNWf4/50003 AND THERE'S SPECIAL WORKERS FOR DOING THAT
trainval/CZNrOzgNWf4/50004 EVERYBODY WAS HAPPY
trainval/CZNrOzgNWf4/50005 WHAT DO YOU MEAN EPIDEMIC
trainval/D03n5dAmBSE/50001 AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO CREATE SOME INCREDIBLY INTRIGUING OPPORTUNITIES FOR TECHNOLOGISTS
trainval/D03n5dAmBSE/50002 NOW TO BE CLEAR I'M A JOURNALIST AND NOT A TECHNOLOGIST SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO BRIEFLY IS PAINT A PICTURE OF WHAT
trainval/D03n5dAmBSE/50003 NOW WE'RE ALREADY SEEING SOME SERVICES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO LET US DECIDE WHAT HAPPENS TO OUR ONLINE PROFILE
trainval/D03n5dAmBSE/50004 ONE OF THEM ACTUALLY FITTINGLY ENOUGH FOUND ME WHEN I CHECKED INTO A DELI AT A
trainval/D03n5dAmBSE/50005 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/d0a0eXJ5TJM/50001 THESE ARE THE ONES WHO FIT NEITHER THE POLICY STEREOTYPE OF THE LOW SKILLED AND THE MARGINALIZED
trainval/d0a0eXJ5TJM/50002 WHAT WE DISCOVERED OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS WAS NOBODY HAD DISTINGUISHED BETWEEN
trainval/d0LQCXCiW8g/50001 HE COULD HAVE SAVED THIS CHILD
trainval/d0LQCXCiW8g/50002 I WAS 17 YEARS OLD
trainval/d0LQCXCiW8g/50003 HE WAS ON COUMADIN
trainval/d0LQCXCiW8g/50004 AND HE SAVED MY FATHER
trainval/d0LQCXCiW8g/50005 COULD YOU IMAGINE HOW I FELT IN THAT MOMENT
trainval/d0LQCXCiW8g/50006 LAST YEAR ALONE WE TREATED IN ISRAEL 207000 PEOPLE
trainval/d0yGdNEWdn0/50001 HOW DO YOU LEARN FASTER
trainval/d0yGdNEWdn0/50002 BUT HYPNOPAEDIA DID OPEN THE DOORS TO RESEARCH IN OTHER AREAS AND WE'VE HAD INCREDIBLE
trainval/d0yGdNEWdn0/50003 AND I ALSO WENT IN WITH A DIFFERENT IDEA WHICH WAS
trainval/d0yGdNEWdn0/50004 HOW DO YOU DO THAT
trainval/d0yGdNEWdn0/50005 AND THEN SHE CAME ACROSS THESE FIVE PRINCIPLES SHE MOVED TO BRAZIL AND SHE APPLIED THEM AND IN SIX MONTHS SHE
trainval/d0yGdNEWdn0/50006 AND IF YOU DROP YOURSELF INTO A CONTEXT WHICH IS ALL ADULTS TALKING ABOUT STUFF OVER YOUR HEAD YOU WON'T LEARN
trainval/d0yGdNEWdn0/50007 COME WITH ME ON A JOURNEY THROUGH A FOREST
trainval/d0yGdNEWdn0/50008 WE HAD 48 HOURS TO DELIVER A TRAINING MANUAL IN CHINESE
trainval/d0yGdNEWdn0/50009 THERE'S 20 OR 30 YEARS OF RESEARCH ON THIS STEPHEN KRASHEN A LEADER IN THE FIELD HAS PUBLISHED ALL SORTS OF THESE
trainval/d0yGdNEWdn0/50010 SO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HEAR THESE SOUNDS
trainval/d0yGdNEWdn0/50011 ALL IN YOUR TARGET LANGUAGE
trainval/d0yGdNEWdn0/50012 AND IF YOU CAN'T GET A NATIVE SPEAKER TO LOOK AT YOU CAN USE STUFF LIKE THIS
trainval/d0yGdNEWdn0/50013 DO THEM ALL AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE FLUENT IN A SECOND LANGUAGE IN SIX MONTHS
trainval/d1D2SGSBhlA/50001 EVENTUALLY SEX' AND THINKING' GOT MARRIED
trainval/d1D2SGSBhlA/50002 IT STILL DOES
trainval/d1D2SGSBhlA/50003 AND INDEED IT WAS CHEWING GUM
trainval/d1D2SGSBhlA/50004 SAID BIG MYSTERY'S MOTHER
trainval/d1D2SGSBhlA/50005 THE OVERNIGHT' FELL DOWN AND
trainval/d1D2SGSBhlA/50006 THAT IS THE WAY IT WAS AND IS AND WILL BE
trainval/d1D2SGSBhlA/50007 NOW WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
trainval/d1D2SGSBhlA/50008 THERE WAS I DON'T KNOW
trainval/d1D2SGSBhlA/50009 THERE IS A MOTHER BACK BEHIND EVERYTHING
trainval/D1QoyTmeAYw/50001 I HEARD THE GUIDANCE COUNSELOR ASK FROM ACROSS THE ROOM MILES AWAY IT SEEMED LIKE HE SAID MARK
trainval/D1QoyTmeAYw/50002 I JUST TOOK A DEEP BREATH
trainval/D1QoyTmeAYw/50003 AND THIS IS HOW I DO IT
trainval/D1QoyTmeAYw/50004 THESE ARE THE FACTORS WHICH CREATE THAT BUBBLE WHICH SURROUNDS US THAT IS OUR PERCEPTUAL FIELD OUR
trainval/D1QoyTmeAYw/50005 AND THAT'S BECAUSE SUICIDE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN NOT A CRIMINAL ONE
trainval/D1QoyTmeAYw/50006 WELL THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE ANYMORE
trainval/D1QoyTmeAYw/50007 WHEN OUR FIRST NATIONS INUIT AND MANTIS COMMUNITIES ARE BEING RAVAGED BY A SUICIDE RATE 5 6
trainval/D1QoyTmeAYw/50008 SO I STAYED LIKE THAT FOR A WHILE
trainval/d25l1aPz2kc/50001 WELL IT'S A LONG STORY BUT I'LL DO MY BEST TO TELL IT IN ABOUT 9
trainval/d25l1aPz2kc/50002 I STILL BELIEVE THAT BY THE WAY
trainval/d25l1aPz2kc/50003 AND I REALIZED
trainval/d25l1aPz2kc/50004 THIS WAS BLASPHEMY
trainval/d25l1aPz2kc/50005 WE REALIZED THAT WE NEEDED SOMETHING THAT SCRAPED EVERY SURFACE OF ITSELF SO THAT ALL
trainval/d38LKbYfWrs/50001 I WANT YOU TO TAKE A LISTEN TO HOW THEY SOUND
trainval/d38LKbYfWrs/50002 SO I REACHED OUT TO MY COLLABORATOR TIM BUNNELL
trainval/d38LKbYfWrs/50003 BUT I THOUGHT THERE HAD TO BE A WAY TO REVERSE ENGINEER A VOICE FROM WHATEVER
trainval/d38LKbYfWrs/50004 WE CALL THIS PROJECT VOCALID OR VOCAL I
trainval/d38LKbYfWrs/50005 WHAT SHE CAN PRODUCE ARE MOSTLY VOWEL LIKE SOUNDS BUT THAT'S ENOUGH FOR US TO EXTRACT HER SOURCE
trainval/d38LKbYfWrs/50006 SO THAT'S THE SCIENCE BEHIND WHAT WE'RE DOING
trainval/D4cV8yfgNyI/50001 AND HE SAID SURE
trainval/D4cV8yfgNyI/50002 RED BLACK RED FASTER BLACK BLACK BLACK RED THROUGH THE WHOLE DECK BLACK BLACK RED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM
trainval/D4cV8yfgNyI/50003 BUT I ALWAYS STRUGGLED TO MAINTAIN THEM
trainval/D4cV8yfgNyI/50004 IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO CARE ABOUT SOMEBODY IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THEM
trainval/D4cV8yfgNyI/50005 FIRST NAME LAST NAME MR
trainval/d4Dj0qdWLnk/50001 NOT AMONG THE CORE VALUES OF THE EUROPEAN PROJECT
trainval/D5iFVKhLStU/50001 WE MUST CEASE TELLING PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE TO ACT A CERTAIN WAY THAT THEY HAVE TO BEHAVE A CERTAIN WAY
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50001 HE HAD TERRIBLE CHEST PAINS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE DIABETES HIGH CHOLESTEROL
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50003 SO I TOOK A JOB ON THE BIG ISLAND AS A PLANTATION DOCTOR
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50004 I KNEW WHAT A REAL DOCTOR DID
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50005 AND THEY WOULDN T GET WELL
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50006 I WAS TAKING CARE OF FIRST SECOND THIRD AND FOURTH GENERATION OF FILIPINOS JAPANESE CHINESE AND
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50007 THE PHILIPPINES JAPAN CHINA KOREA
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50008 TRIM HEALTHY HARDY PEOPLE
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50009 I WENT BACK TO OAHU TO BECOME A BOARD CERTIFIED INTERNIST
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50010 JULIEA BAKER DECIDED AT 17 YEARS OLD SHE WAS GOING TO CHANGE HER DIET
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50011 I COULD FULFILL WHAT I WANTED TO DO AS A PHYSICIAN WHICH IS TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE BY APPLYING THIS VERY
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50012 BUT THERE IS A DIET FOR HUMAN BEINGS
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50014 AND THINK ABOUT THESE PEOPLE
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50015 AND THEN AS TIME WENT ON MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO EAT LIKE KINGS AND QUEENS
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50016 YOU RECALL KING HENRY 8TH AND HIS COURT
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50017 THAT S WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50018 AND THEN AS TIME WENT ON WE BECAME MORE EFFICIENT AT GATHERING FOOD
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50019 PEOPLE BECAME WEALTHIER
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50020 WE HAD THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION IN ITS MIDST OF 150 YEARS AGO
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50021 CAN T YOU SEE IT
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50022 SOMEHOW IT S OKAY FOR THE KIDS TO BE SICK
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50023 BECAUSE THE RICH WESTERN DIET FEEDS THEM A DIET OF KINGS AND QUEENS
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50024 WE CAN WORK HARD TO GET OUR EMPLOYEES HEALTHY
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50025 HOW CAN WE EVER GET AHEAD
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50026 OCTOBER 21ST 2012
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50027 THE SURGEON GENERAL S REPORT OF 1964 CHANGED AMERICA
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50028 IT CHANGED THE WESTERN WORLD
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50030 EXCEPT WHEN THEY WENT TO BATTLE THEN THEY'D SWITCH TO QUINOA AND IF YOU GO TO THE MIDDLE EAST THESE PEOPLE ARE FROM THE BREAD BASKETS OF THE
trainval/d5wfMNNr3ak/50031 YOU SAY I CAN DO THAT
trainval/d5zjjJYqixo/50001 I LOVE CHILDREN AND CHILDREN LOVE TO PLAY WITH ME
trainval/d5zjjJYqixo/50002 I GOT THE ANSWER
trainval/d5zjjJYqixo/50003 HOWEVER THERE WAS A PROBLEM BECAUSE I GOT SOMEWHERE AROUND
trainval/d5zjjJYqixo/50004 WE ARE ALL BORN DIFFERENT TO DIFFERENT FATHERS AND MOTHERS BUT WE ARE ALL THE SAME
trainval/d5zjjJYqixo/50006 WHEN WE ARE ALL THE SAME WHY DO WE HATE FIGHT AND CRY
trainval/d6eMdixkoRI/50001 AND I WANT YOU TO DO IT IN YOUR OWN WAY
trainval/d6eMdixkoRI/50002 THE TOP OF THE BACK
trainval/d6eMdixkoRI/50003 OURS ARE JUST ARRANGED BETTER
trainval/d6eMdixkoRI/50004 IF I THROW THEM WHILE I'M RUNNING AWAY THEY'LL GO SLOWER
trainval/d6eMdixkoRI/50005 BUT THE CONSISTENCY OF THE ANSWERS THAT WE GET SHOW US THAT THIS ASSUMPTION SEEMS TO BE TRUE
trainval/d6eMdixkoRI/50006 YOU'RE NOT REALLY SEEING ME NOW
trainval/d6eMdixkoRI/50007 YOU THINK YOU ARE BUT YOU ARE REALLY SEEING ME AS I WAS ONE HUNDRED NANOSECONDS AGO OR SO
trainval/d6eMdixkoRI/50008 WHY IS THAT
trainval/d6eMdixkoRI/50009 IF THE ALIENS ARE WATCHING US FROM THE NEAREST STARS THEY'RE SEEING US AS WE WERE YEARS AGO
trainval/d6eMdixkoRI/50010 WE ALSO NOW KNOW THAT PLANETS AROUND OTHER STARS ARE COMMON
trainval/d6eMdixkoRI/50011 WE SEE A RICHER TAPESTRY
trainval/d6eMdixkoRI/50012 10 TO THE 11 STARTS IN ONE GALAXY
trainval/d6eMdixkoRI/50013 JUST A MYSTERY
trainval/d6eMdixkoRI/50014 ALL OF THE ATOMS IN YOUR BODY WERE MADE SOMEWHERE
trainval/d6eMdixkoRI/50015 ALL THE CARBON OXYGEN ALL THAT STUFF WAS MADE IN THE FIERY FURNACES OF STARS THAT SPEWED THEIR GUTS INTO
trainval/d6eMdixkoRI/50016 I THINK THERE ARE THREE AMAZING THOUGHTS THAT I LIKE TO KEEP IN MIND
trainval/d6eMdixkoRI/50017 JUST LIKE IN A SONNET OR A TWEET WHERE THE RULES MAKE YOU DO MORE
trainval/d6eMdixkoRI/50018 WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE NATURE OF THIS DARK ENERGY AND DARK MATTER
trainval/d6eMdixkoRI/50019 MY OWN SPECIALTY IS NEUTRINOS
trainval/d6eMdixkoRI/50020 IN THE TIME IT TOOK ME TO SAY THAT 10 TO THE 12 OF THEM PASSED THROUGH YOUR EYES
trainval/d6KSsePuFAo/50001 I ASKED ALEC HOW HE AND HIS WIFE RACHEL MET AND HE TOLD ME THE STORY OF A HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL

trainval/d6wGSsAdP0U/50006 VERY FEW OF US HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE TOTALLY AND BRUTALLY HONEST WITH OURSELVES
trainval/d6wGSsAdP0U/50007 FOR ME THE HOBBIES THAT I HAVE ARE REALLY JUST NEW WORK PROJECTS THAT I'VE LAUNCHED
trainval/d6wGSsAdP0U/50008 I ALSO WANTED SOMEBODY WHO NOT ONLY WANTED TWO CHILDREN BUT WAS GOING TO HAVE THE SAME ATTITUDE TOWARD PARENTING THAT I DO
trainval/d6wGSsAdP0U/50009 I ALSO WANTED SOMEBODY WHO WOULD WEIGH 20 POUNDS MORE THAN ME AT ALL TIMES REGARDLESS OF WHAT I WEIGHED

trainval/d6wGSsAdP0U/50018 WELL AS IT TURNS OUT THERE IS AN ALGORITHM FOR LOVE
trainval/d6wGSsAdP0U/50019 IT'S JUST NOT THE ONES THAT WE'RE BEING PRESENTED WITH ONLINE
trainval/d6wGSsAdP0U/50020 IN FACT IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU WRITE YOURSELF
trainval/d8s8e8JdGCc/50001 AND SO OUR BRAIN LOVES PATTERNS AND PATTERNS IN SOUND ARE INCREDIBLY COMPLEX AND SOPHISTICATED

trainval/d8s8e8JdGCc/50007 WHY DID I DECIDE TO COME AND TALK ABOUT THIS
trainval/d8s8e8JdGCc/50008 EMPLOYERS TELL US WHEN WE DO THE RESEARCH THAT YES THEY WANT PEOPLE WHO CAN READ AND WRITE AND
trainval/d8s8e8JdGCc/50009 IN MY COUNTRY IN GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS SOMETIMES AS LOW AS 20 IN SOME STATES ACTUALLY HAVE A SPECIALIST MUSIC TEACHER
trainval/D9Ihs241zeg/50001 NOW I LOVED THOSE AMERICAN AND BRITISH BOOKS I READ

trainval/D9S6G8J6VJg/50002 BUT IT WAS REALLY GREAT
trainval/D9S6G8J6VJg/50003 WE SAW ALL THE ANIMALS

trainval/D9S6G8J6VJg/50008 HE SAID NO NO NO THE SCHOOL
trainval/D9S6G8J6VJg/50009 I KNOW EVERYTHING
trainval/D9S6G8J6VJg/50010 FULL STOP NOW
trainval/D9S6G8J6VJg/50011 SORRY FOR THE WORDS
trainval/D9S6G8J6VJg/50013 EVERYBODY IS WORKING ON THAT
trainval/D9S6G8J6VJg/50014 WE WILL DOMINATE EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY IS GOING TO PAY THROUGH THEIR PHONES
trainval/D9S6G8J6VJg/50015 FORTY MILLION PEOPLE ARE THERE
trainval/D9S6G8J6VJg/50016 SO HOW DO THEY GET PEOPLE MONEY
trainval/D9S6G8J6VJg/50017 HE GETS AUTOMATIC PAYMENT ON HIS MOBILE PHONE FROM THIS INSURANCE COMPANY
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50001 AND IT'S TIME WE CHANGE THAT
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50002 I'M A DOCTOR
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50003 SO IT STARTS TO RISE
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50004 IT PROBABLY WON'T SURPRISE YOU TO HEAR THAT MOST OF MY PATIENTS HAVE INSULIN RESISTANCE OR
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50005 PLUS IT'S BEEN SHOWN THAT 16 25 OF NORMAL WEIGHT ADULTS ARE
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50006 AND WITH PROTEINS IT LOOKS A LOT BETTER
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50007 I WANT YOU TO GO BACK AND THINK ABOUT THE LAST TIME YOU ATE AN AMERICAN VERSION OF CHINESE
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50008 RULE NUMBER TWO IS
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50009 AND WE HAVE THIS SETUP
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50010 THESE GUIDELINES THEN GO ON TO SAY
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50011 WE ARE IN A DIABETES EPIDEMIC NOW THAT WE ARE SPENDING 250 BILLION A YEAR ON IN THIS
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50012 HER DIABETES WAS WAY OUT OF CONTROL
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50013 ONE OF THE GREATEST JOYS OF MY JOB IS TO BE ABLE TO TELL A PATIENT LIKE THIS THAT THEY NO LONGER HAVE
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50014 SO WHAT DOES THIS LOOK LIKE THEN
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50015 HOW DOES SOMEBODY EAT THIS WAY
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50016 RULE NUMBER ONE
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50017 IF IT SAYS LIGHT LOW FAT OR FAT FREE STAYS IN GROCERY STORE
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50018 BECAUSE THEY TOOK THE FAT OUT THEY PUT CARBS AND CHEMICALS IN
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50019 AND EAT WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY DON'T EAT WHEN YOU'RE NOT NO MATTER WHAT THE CLOCK SAYS
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50020 CAN YOU STILL EAT THIS WAY
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50021 I AM A GREAT EXAMPLE
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50022 SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM THEN
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50023 WHY IS THIS NOT EVERYWHERE
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50024 WHY ISN'T LOW CARB THE NORM
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50025 THERE'S TWO BIG REASONS
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50026 IT IS HARD TO BREAK
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50027 TWO IMPORTANT THINGS
trainval/da1vvigy5tQ/50028 DON'T BE FOOLED THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY TO BE MADE FROM KEEPING YOU SICK
trainval/DajRM7VyeZ4/50001 AND IT'S BEEN COLD CONSISTENTLY FOR AT LEAST THE LAST MILLION YEARS
trainval/DajRM7VyeZ4/50002 WE LOOK FOR FROZEN BONES WHEREVER THE PERMAFROST IS MELTING ALONG RIVERBEDS AROUND LAKES AND AT ACTIVE GOLD MINING SITES
trainval/DajRM7VyeZ4/50003 WHEN ALL WAS PUT TOGETHER AND MAPPED TO THE ELEPHANT IT LOOKED LIKE ABOUT 50 OF THE MAMMOTH GENOME HAD BEEN
trainval/DajRM7VyeZ4/50004 GIVE YOU A HINT IS NOT A VERY BIG NUMBER
trainval/DajRM7VyeZ4/50005 IT'S THE OTHER PART THE HETEROCHROMATIN THAT IS MADE OF TIGHTLY CONDENSED REPEAT SEQUENCES THAT ARE JUST SUPER HARD TO
trainval/DajRM7VyeZ4/50006 WE GO INTO THE ARCTIC WE FIND THE REALLY WELL PRESERVED MAMMOTH BONE WE TAKE A CHUNK OUT OF IT AND BRING IT BACK TO THE LAB AND WE SEQUENCE
trainval/DajRM7VyeZ4/50007 NOT SO FOR THE MAMMOTH
trainval/DajRM7VyeZ4/50008 AND TO SOME EXTENT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE BUT THERE IS ANOTHER PROBLEM
trainval/DajRM7VyeZ4/50010 I COULD GET DNA FROM FOSSILS AND USE THIS TO WATCH SPECIES EVOLVE THROUGH TIME
trainval/DajRM7VyeZ4/50011 A ROPE OR A RIBBON OR PARTY STREAMERS SAY LIKE THOSE WE'RE GONNA PUT UP TO CELEBRATE THE BIRTH OF
trainval/DajRM7VyeZ4/50012 BUT AS WE PROGRESS TOWARD THIS GOAL WE'RE GOING TO LEARN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT ABOUT THESE EXTINCT ANIMALS KNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE
trainval/DajRM7VyeZ4/50013 WE WILL LEARN HOW TO FIX THE BROKEN BITS SO WE CAN START PIECING TOGETHER THESE LITTLE TINY FRAGMENTS INTO LONGER AND LONGER
trainval/DajRM7VyeZ4/50014 IF IT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO WE WILL EVENTUALLY BE ABLE TO SEQUENCE THE COMPLETE GENOME OF AN EXTINCT ANIMAL
trainval/dbic3JCX1jo/50001 I KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
trainval/dbic3JCX1jo/50002 IT IS SO EASY TO FIND THE NEGATIVES IN SCHOOL
trainval/dbic3JCX1jo/50003 I KNOW IT CAN BE HARD TRUST ME I STRUGGLE WITH IT EVERYDAY
trainval/DBoShCrKfLQ/50001 IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T APPRECIATE THE NATURAL WONDERS OF THE WORLD
trainval/DBoShCrKfLQ/50002 THE QUESTION IS WHERE DOES THIS URGE COME FROM
trainval/DBoShCrKfLQ/50003 WE LOVE STORIES DON'T WE
trainval/DBoShCrKfLQ/50004 MY HEAD MY WHOLE SELF WAS ALWAYS IN A BOOK
trainval/DBoShCrKfLQ/50005 I WAS PETER PAN AND WENDY
trainval/DBoShCrKfLQ/50006 AND FROM UP THERE ON A SMOG FREE DAY YOU CAN SEE ALL THE WAY TO THE ANGELES CREST ON ONE SIDE AND TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN
trainval/DBoShCrKfLQ/50007 AND HIGH STAKES AND ROMANCE
trainval/DBoShCrKfLQ/50008 HONEY WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
trainval/DBoShCrKfLQ/50009 WHAT DO YOU MEAN
trainval/DBoShCrKfLQ/50010 WE HUMAN BEINGS WOE IS US WE HAVE THIS TWO PRONGED PROBLEM
trainval/DBoShCrKfLQ/50011 YOU CANNOT HAVE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER
trainval/DBoShCrKfLQ/50012 SHE TELLS A WHOPPER OF A LIE
trainval/DBoShCrKfLQ/50013 VANESSA REDGRAVE WAS STUMPED IN THE MOMENT
trainval/DBoShCrKfLQ/50014 BUT THOUGH THE CRIME WAS THE CATALYST IT TURNS OUT NOT TO BE THE MAIN EVENT OF THE BOOK WHICH LIKE SO MANY IN THIS
trainval/DBoShCrKfLQ/50015 I CHALKED IT UP TO HER PROFESSION
trainval/DBoShCrKfLQ/50016 WE WHO RESOLVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO EACH OTHER'S STORIES AND VISIONS AND
trainval/DBoShCrKfLQ/50017 I'M THEREFORE SURPRISED AND A LITTLE EMBARRASSED WHEN PEOPLE OFFER ME CONDOLENCES
trainval/dBxvZwJZgdM/50001 AND ALL THIS BY SIMPLY WATCHING THE CHILD'S BRAINWAVES
trainval/dciTrZxqbHE/50001 SOMETHING VISCERAL IS TRANSFERRED TO US BY WATCHING OTHERS IN MOTION AS IF WE WERE THE ONES MOVING
trainval/dcwuBo4PvE0/50001 THERE WERE CALLS FOR A SECOND REFERENDUM ALMOST AS IF FOLLOWING A SPORTS MATCH WE COULD ASK THE
trainval/dcwuBo4PvE0/50002 EVERYBODY WAS BLAMING EVERYBODY ELSE
trainval/dcwuBo4PvE0/50003 WAS IT SOMETHING THAT TOOK PLACE OVERNIGHT
trainval/dcwuBo4PvE0/50004 HINDSIGHT IS A WONDERFUL THING
trainval/dcwuBo4PvE0/50005 GEOGRAPHICALLY IT WAS LONDON AND SCOTLAND THAT MOST STRONGLY COMMITTED TO BEING PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WHILE IN
trainval/dcwuBo4PvE0/50006 IT'S NO LONGER JUST ABOUT TAX AND SPEND
trainval/dcwuBo4PvE0/50007 IT'S ABOUT GLOBALIZATION
trainval/dcwuBo4PvE0/50008 THE FAULT LINE OF CONTEMPORARY POLITICS IS BETWEEN THOSE THAT EMBRACE GLOBALIZATION AND THOSE THAT
trainval/dcwuBo4PvE0/50009 THAT VISION OF GLOBALIZATION IS ONE THAT HAS TO START BY A RECOGNITION OF THE
trainval/dcwuBo4PvE0/50010 THE CONSENSUS AMONGST ECONOMISTS IS THAT FREE TRADE THE MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL THE MOVEMENT OF
trainval/dcwuBo4PvE0/50011 AND HE SAID AND I PARAPHRASE THE GLASS HOUSE OF GLOBALIZATION
trainval/dcwuBo4PvE0/50012 BUT AMID AUSTERITY AND THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2008 THE CONCEPT DISAPPEARED ALMOST
trainval/dcwuBo4PvE0/50013 THE FIRST RELATES TO THE IDEA OF CIVIC EDUCATION
trainval/dcwuBo4PvE0/50014 WHAT STANDS OUT FROM BREXIT IS THE GAP BETWEEN PUBLIC PERCEPTION AND EMPIRICAL REALITY
trainval/dcwuBo4PvE0/50015 IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED THAT WE'VE MOVED TO A POSTFACTUAL SOCIETY WHERE EVIDENCE AND TRUTH NO LONGER
trainval/dcwuBo4PvE0/50016 SO WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS MISINFORMATION THE GAP BETWEEN PERCEPTION AND REALITY ON KEY ASPECTS OF
trainval/dcwuBo4PvE0/50017 SO WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS
trainval/dcwuBo4PvE0/50018 IT CREATES WINNERS AND LOSERS
trainval/dcwuBo4PvE0/50019 WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT OLDER GENERATIONS WHO MAYBE CAN'T TRAVEL GET ACCESS TO THE INTERNET
trainval/dcwuBo4PvE0/50020 THAT WAS THE SPEECH IN WHICH HE COINED THAT TERM
trainval/dcwuBo4PvE0/50021 I AM STILL A GLOBAL CITIZEN
trainval/dcySuzHPCWM/50001 IT'S ALSO AN EXCUSE GENERATOR
trainval/dcySuzHPCWM/50002 SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU MAY SMOKE BECAUSE AS A CHILD YOU SAW SOMEONE SMOKING SURROUNDED BY MANY
trainval/dcySuzHPCWM/50003 THE SURGERY WAS SUCCESSFUL
trainval/ddek3gQVt9Y/50001 THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT MAKING THE WORLD MORE INNOVATIVE COMPASSIONATE AND SUSTAINABLE
trainval/ddek3gQVt9Y/50002 BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/ddek3gQVt9Y/50003 SHE WAS WORKING AS THE MARKETING DIRECTOR FOR A JEWELRY COMPANY IN SAN FRANCISCO
trainval/ddek3gQVt9Y/50004 SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO QUIT YOUR JOB TOMORROW
trainval/ddek3gQVt9Y/50005 HE'S LIKE MY FRIENDS ARE STARTING A STARTUP IN PALO ALTO THERE'S THREE OF THEM THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW
trainval/ddek3gQVt9Y/50006 AND I'M LIKE THANK YOU MAN YOU MADE THE ASK
trainval/ddek3gQVt9Y/50007 WE WENT OUT TO DINNER AND I SAID WHAT'S GOING ON MAN
trainval/DdrcJLKyHtU/50001 I WAS SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO WERE ONLY NINETEEN YEARS OLD BUT THEY WERE SO OPEN
trainval/dDZoGcQVjJg/50001 IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY WORDS YOU CAN SAY HOW MANY PHRASES YOU KNOW
trainval/dE1DuBesGYM/50001 THAT'S AN EPIC WIN
trainval/dE1DuBesGYM/50002 THIS IS A GAMER ON THE VERGE OF AN EPIC WIN
trainval/dE1DuBesGYM/50003 WE DO ACHIEVE MORE IN GAME WORLDS
trainval/dE1DuBesGYM/50004 SO THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO STUDY WHEN I WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT
trainval/dE1DuBesGYM/50005 THEY NEVER GIVE YOU A CHALLENGE YOU CAN'T ACHIEVE
trainval/dE1DuBesGYM/50006 FIVE MILLION PEOPLE USE IT EVERY MONTH
trainval/dE1DuBesGYM/50007 BUT IT IS NOT BY ANY MEANS AN OPTIMAL SITUATION
trainval/dE1DuBesGYM/50008 NOW THIS SOUNDS CRAZY RIGHT
trainval/dE1DuBesGYM/50009 AND SO RECENTLY SCIENTISTS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT HERODOTUS' CRAZY STORY IS ACTUALLY TRUE
trainval/dE1DuBesGYM/50010 OKAY WE CAN DO THAT
trainval/dE1DuBesGYM/50011 NOW I KNOW YOU'RE ASKING HOW ARE WE GOING TO SOLVE REAL WORLD PROBLEMS IN GAMES
trainval/dE1DuBesGYM/50012 AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS IS A TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCE
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50001 BUT LITERALLY MAKE NO MISTAKE AROUND THEM
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50002 I WAS NO LONGER THE EXPERT IN THE LANGUAGE SPOKEN AROUND ME
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50003 AND I WOULD MAKE ACTUAL MISTAKES THERE
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50004 I WOULD SAY THINGS LIKE I LIKE SHEEPS MORE THAN GOATS
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50005 NO IT'S LIKE HOW YOUR BODY REACTS TO SOMETHING TO WHICH YOU ARE ALLERGIC
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50006 SO LET'S TRY A COUPLE OF SENTENCES TOGETHER
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50007 AND THEN IT HIT ME
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50008 I HAD BEEN DOING THE SAME THING WITH GREEK
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50009 I HAD BEEN JUDGING MODERN GREEK BASED ON GRAMMATICAL RULES FROM TWO AND A HALF MILLENNIA AGO
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50010 SO WHY ARE THINGS OUR BRAIN DOES NOT DETECT AS MISTAKES JUDGED
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50011 WHY ARE THEY STUCK THERE
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50012 BECAUSE THEY FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE WITH LANGUAGE CHANGE
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50013 AND SO IT'S NO LONGER PURE
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50014 THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CALLED PURISTS
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50015 WHERE IS THIS DISCREPANCY COMING FROM
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50016 WHEN WAS THAT GOLDEN AGE
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50017 GET OVER IT
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50018 LET ME EXPLAIN THAT BY GIVING AN EXAMPLE
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50019 AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CANNOT GET OVER
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50020 LANGUAGE PURISTS ARE STUCK THERE
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50021 BECAUSE THAT WAS THE TIME WHEN LANGUAGE WAS STANDARDISED
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50022 THEY STANDARDISED THE DIALECT OF THE HIGH SOCIETY IN LONDON AND THEY FORMED
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50023 SO THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE FORMAL LANGUAGE
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50024 AND TO WHOM DID YOU SPEAK
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50027 SO THAT'S THEIR BIGGEST MISTAKE
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50028 YOU PERCEIVE GRAMMARS AND DICTIONARIES TO BE HOLY BOOKS THE
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50029 A LINGUISTIC MISTAKE' IS NOT A SIN
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50030 IT'S JUST A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT
trainval/DEmjzXi2lfI/50031 DO YOURSELVES A FAVOUR AND SEE THOSE BOOKS FOR WHAT THEY REALLY ARE
trainval/DERu2aAqqWM/50001 IN THE HOME FOR CHILD REARING WHERE PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS AND CHILDREN ENGAGE IN DAILY
trainval/DERu2aAqqWM/50002 FOR EXAMPLE PLAYING CARDS WITH THE LANGUAGE ALLOW THE GRANDPARENTS PARENTS AND
trainval/DERu2aAqqWM/50003 IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT LANGUAGE
trainval/DERu2aAqqWM/50004 TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF INFORMATION IS STORED AND ENCODED IN LANGUAGE
trainval/DERu2aAqqWM/50005 THE STORY OF THE SEA LEVEL CHANGE
trainval/DERu2aAqqWM/50006 MOST OF THE SPEAKERS ARE IN THEIR LATE 50S OR OLDER
trainval/DERu2aAqqWM/50007 WE HAD HER HERE ON THE UT ARLINGTON CAMPUS AND WERE ABLE TO USE TECHNOLOGY TO HELP CREATE MATERIALS THAT CAN BE
trainval/DERu2aAqqWM/50008 TOHONO O'ODHAM COMMUNITY ACTION IS A NON PROFIT IT'S ENGAGED IN THE LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL
trainval/DERu2aAqqWM/50009 AND UT ARLINGTON'S NATIVE AMERICAN LANGUAGES LAB WAS PARTNER ON THAT PROJECT AND SO WE WERE VERY
trainval/DERu2aAqqWM/50010 CEREMONIES TRADITIONAL GAMES IT'S ALL ABOUT HEALTH AND LIFE WAYS AND FINDING THAT WHOLENESS
trainval/DERu2aAqqWM/50011 THE HUMAN SPIRIT CRAVES THAT CONNECTION TO ANCESTORS BUT THE HUMAN SPIRIT ALSO HAS GREAT
trainval/DERu2aAqqWM/50012 THE O'ODHAM HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST IBD RATES IN THE WORLD AND RECLAIMING THAT CULTURAL CONNECTION CAN
trainval/DERu2aAqqWM/50013 WHEN THE CHEROKEE WERE FORCED OUT OF THEIR TRADITIONAL LANDS IN THE SOUTH EAST INTO WHAT WAS THEN INDIAN TERRITORY
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50001 WHERE YOU WILL GO WHAT YOU WILL DO
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50002 THEY OFTEN TALK ABOUT THE ADVENTURE
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50003 PART OF YOU KNOWS THAT A YEAR OF NATIONAL SERVICE CAN PUT YOU ON A BETTER PATH
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50004 STUDIES SHOW ANXIETY AND UNHAPPINESS AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE IS ON THE RISE
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50005 I FOUND MYSELF IN A CORPORATE LAW FIRM IN NEW YORK AND PARIS
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50006 HIS NAME WAS TED SORENSON
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50007 AND I SAID MR
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50008 SORENSON I FIND MYSELF READING BOOKS ON THE CONSTITUTION AND THE LINCOLN DOUGLAS DEBATES NOT HOW TO
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50009 OR THEY COULD HANG UP MALARIA BED NETS IN AFRICA
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50010 CONSIDER THE STORY OF MY NOW DEAR FRIEND LASHANTAY MOORE
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50011 FROM ANACOSTIA A TEENAGE UNWED MOTHER WHO HAD DROPPED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50012 HER LIFE PROSPECTS WERE REALLY DIM
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50013 BUT SHE FOUND THROUGH WORD OF MOUTH THE EARTH CONSERVATION CORPS THIS FABULOUS NATIONAL SERVICE EXPERIENCE THAT PUT HER TO
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50014 PREVIOUSLY SOCIETY VIEWED ME AS SOME PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50015 RUSHMORE FOR HIS AMAZING CONSERVATION SERVICE LEGACY WHO SAID THAT
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50016 IN THE END SUCCESS OR FAILURE WILL DEPEND UPON HOW WE CONDUCT OURSELVES IN THE ORDINARY AFFAIRS OF
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50017 IT WAS RONALD REAGAN THIS MAY SURPRISE YOU AS GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA WHO CREATED THE CALIFORNIA
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50018 I THINK I GOT THEM ALL
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50019 HE WAS THE ONE WHO LED THE FLOOR DEBATE FOR THE PASSAGE OF WHAT HE THEN CALLED
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50020 REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ALIKE HAVE ISSUED THE CALL TO SERVICE DOWN THE AGES AND IT HAS ELICITED SHEER
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50021 IT WAS RONALD REAGAN WHO WENT TO THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION AND SAID
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50022 IT WAS PRESIDENT BUSH 41 WHO SAID
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50023 A BRILLIANT DIVERSITY SPREAD LIKE STARS LIKE A THOUSAND POINTS OF LIGHT
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50024 WE WILL RESTORE OUR COMMITMENT TO AMERICAN COMMUNITY IN OUR TIME AND MAKE AFFORDABLE THE
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50025 BUSH AFTER 9 11
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50026 OUR EMAILS WERE LIGHTING UP WITH OFFERS FROM FRIENDS AND STRANGERS TO GIVE A HAND
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50027 IN FACT IN NEW YORK CITY THERE WAS SUCH A RESPONSE OF COMPASSION AND LOVE FROM
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50028 AND AS WE TRY TO BRING MONEYBALL TO GOVERNMENT AND MAKE THE EFFECTIVE CASE FOR NATIONAL SERVICE
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50029 NATIONAL STUDIES SHOW THAT NATIONAL SERVICE REDUCES CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM AND BOOSTS MATH AND READING
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50030 OH YOU'VE DONE YOUR SERVICE THAT'S IT
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50031 SO IT HAS A HUGE CIVIC EFFECT AND WHEN BOB PUTNAM TALKS ABOUT BOWLING ALONE WE CAN BOWL TOGETHER
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50032 IT WAS PRESIDENT GEORGE W
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50033 AND BOTH PARTIES HAVE PRIORITIES
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50034 IT DOES TODAY AND WE HAVE MORE THAN 200 COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES THAT ARE CREATING SERVICE YEAR
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50035 AND IF YOU'RE A YOUNG PERSON WHO IS DISCONNECTED FROM SCHOOL OR WORK OR IS FORMERLY IN PRISON YOU CAN DO A
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50036 IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT A COUNTRY IN WHICH A YOUNG PERSON HAS AN OPPORTUNITY
trainval/deT1mILtFEY/50037 THEY WOULD LEARN TO BELIEVE IN THINGS UNTIL THEY DIE TO DEVELOP IDEAS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO CHANGE THE
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50001 IN SOME SENSE IT'S YOUR BRAIN'S BOSS
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50002 HIS MIND WAS WORRIED AND PREOCCUPIED AND HAD STRESSFUL MEMORIES AND REALLY DREAD FOR HIS
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50003 BUT BEFORE I TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT MINDFULNESS TRAINING IS OR THE RESULTS OF THAT STUDY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50004 WE CALL IT THE N170 COMPONENT AND WE USE THIS COMPONENT IN MANY OF OUR STUDIES
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50005 THE BRAIN IS A HIGHLY EFFICIENT ENERGY DEMANDING ORGAN THAT GETS FULLY UTILIZED
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50006 AND TO DO THIS WE HAD TO BASICALLY COME UP WITH AN
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50007 IN WHICH WE COULD HAVE PEOPLE GENERATE THEIR OWN MIND WANDERING
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50008 PRETTY SOON WE COULD TELL THEY WERE SUCCESSFULLY MIND WANDERING BECAUSE THEY'D PRESS THE BUTTON WHEN THAT FACE WAS UPSIDE DOWN EVEN THOUGH IT'S
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50009 SO WE WANTED TO KNOW HERE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE HAVE MIND WANDERING
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50010 AND THINGS LIKE STRESS AND MIND WANDERING DIMINISH ITS POWER
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50011 BUT THAT'S ALL IN THE CONTEXT OF THESE VERY CONTROLLED LABORATORY SETTINGS
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50012 WHAT ABOUT IN THE REAL WORLD
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50013 WHAT ABOUT IN OUR ACTUAL DAY TO DAY LIFE
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50014 WHAT ABOUT NOW
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50015 WHERE IS YOUR ATTENTION RIGHT NOW
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50016 TO BRING IT BACK I'D LIKE TO MAKE A PREDICTION ABOUT YOUR ATTENTION FOR THE REMAINDER OF MY TALK
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50017 YOU UP FOR IT
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50018 OR A SURGEON OR FIREFIGHTER MISSING ANY TIME
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50019 SO ONE QUESTION WE MIGHT ASK IS WHY DO WE DO THIS WHY DO WE MIND WANDER SO MUCH
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50020 WE MAKE ERRORS
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50021 OFTEN IT HAPPENS WITHOUT OUR AWARENESS
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50022 AND UNDER STRESS IT'S EVEN WORSE WE MIND WANDER MORE POWERFULLY AND MORE OFTEN
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50023 IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN POSSIBLY DO ABOUT THIS
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50024 AND PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE IS THAT IF PEOPLE TAKE OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS OVER LET'S SAY EIGHT WEEKS AND THEY
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50025 AND I WANT TO JUST BRING IT BACK TO CAPTAIN JEFF DAVIS
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50026 THEY WERE DISCERNING
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50027 TO US THIS WAS VERY COMPELLING
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50028 HE WAS PROMOTED TO MAJOR
trainval/Df2JBnql8lc/50029 HE ACTUALLY THEN ENDED UP RETIRING FROM THE MARINE CORPS
trainval/dFC2pSkETas/50001 WITH A GROWING MIDDLE CLASS AND A WEALTH OF RESOURCES THAT ARE FAST MAKING IT A VIABLE MARKET FOR A NEW
trainval/dFC2pSkETas/50002 WE MUST DARE INVEST IN THE FUTURE OF AFRICA
trainval/DG7kSeazMQ4/50001 SO THIS IS ME TODAY
trainval/DG7kSeazMQ4/50002 SO I AM THAT GERMAN PERSON
trainval/DG7kSeazMQ4/50003 WHEN SHE LIVED WITH US IT WAS ACTUALLY THE FIRST TIME OF HER LIFE THAT SHE HAD BEEN ABROAD AND INDEPENDENT OF HER
trainval/dghBrSBC34Y/50001 I FOR ONE I AM GLAD THAT THEY SCREEN CARS NOWADAYS
trainval/dghBrSBC34Y/50002 THE AIRPLANE WAS INVENTED BY THE WRIGHT BROTHERS AND WAS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF WORLD WAR I
trainval/dghBrSBC34Y/50006 WHAT AM I TRYING TO GET AT IS
trainval/DgofaSv4MA4/50001 WELL I JUST NEVER LOOKED BACK
trainval/DgofaSv4MA4/50002 I WAS TERRIFIED TOO
trainval/DgofaSv4MA4/50003 THAT IS THE WATER THAT TAKES TO WATER THOSE SOY BEANS TO GROW
trainval/DgofaSv4MA4/50004 BUT IT TAKES 850 GALLONS OF WATER TO GROW EIGHT OUNCES OF BEEF
trainval/DgofaSv4MA4/50005 AND AFTER NOT ONE BUT TWO SUICIDE ATTEMPTS I HAD REACHED A FORK IN THE ROAD
trainval/DgofaSv4MA4/50006 THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ABOUT HIPPIES AND TREE HUGGING AND TOFU EATING BECAUSE HONESTLY
trainval/DgofaSv4MA4/50007 BECAUSE THAT'S IMPORTANT
trainval/DgofaSv4MA4/50008 THAT'S A HALF A GRAM OF PROTEIN PER POUND OF BODY WEIGHT PER DAY TO REPAIR FOR MY TOUGH
trainval/DgofaSv4MA4/50009 I'D LIKE TO CHALLENGE YOU TO GO MEATLESS FOR THE REST OF THE DAY
trainval/DgofaSv4MA4/50010 BUT THE TIDE WAS LOW AND THE SUN WAS REALLY HOT AND THE STARFISH IT SEEMED THEY WERE DOOMED
trainval/DGulIdIS3XE/50001 THAT IS ONCE THEY RE CUT UP BOOT CAMPED AND REUPHOLSTERED THEN RECORD FIVE TRACK ALBUMS
trainval/DGulIdIS3XE/50002 POP GOES THE FACE SHOP
trainval/DGulIdIS3XE/50003 WE HAVE WORN DOWN OUR JAWS CHEWING BARLEY FOR CENTURIES NOW LET US EAT
trainval/DGulIdIS3XE/50004 LET US SWIG OUR GATORADE SWEETER
trainval/DGulIdIS3XE/50005 HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP IS MY BOYFRIEND
trainval/DGulIdIS3XE/50006 THE KOREAN WORD FOR SWEET IS
trainval/DGulIdIS3XE/50007 TIME IS RUNNING OUT
trainval/DGulIdIS3XE/50008 THE KOREAN WORD FOR THE GAME OF DEATH IS
trainval/DGulIdIS3XE/50009 SEOUL KEEPS THE LONELY LOCKED AWAY IN FAST FOOD ICE CUBES AND THE PROPER CUM DUMPSTERS
trainval/DGulIdIS3XE/50011 WHERE SINGERS ARE CALLED IDOLS
trainval/DGvPfD1Dd1U/50001 SO LET ME START WITH AN EXAMPLE
trainval/DGvPfD1Dd1U/50002 AND IT FAILED BECAUSE OF THE GREAT COMPLEXITY OF THE UNDERLYING PHENOMENON
trainval/DGvPfD1Dd1U/50003 IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE CAN PREDEFINE
trainval/DGvPfD1Dd1U/50004 BUT AGAIN THE GOOD NEWS IS NOW WE HAVE SCIENTIFIC TOOLS TO INVESTIGATE THIS EQUILIBRIUM
trainval/DGvPfD1Dd1U/50005 AND THE AIM OF ALL THIS IS TO RAISE A GENERATION OF PEOPLE ABLE TO COME UP WITH NEW IDEAS TO FACE THE
trainval/DGvPfD1Dd1U/50006 WE ALL KNOW
trainval/dhDBxxOKGlg/50001 IT'S DIFFICULT TO BE FIRST BUT IT'S A VERY LONG LINE OF FAST FOLLOWERS WANTING TO BE SECOND
trainval/dhMoQrLEJe0/50001 IN THIS ENVIRONMENT SOUND TRAVELS MUCH MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN LIGHT DOES AS WHALES HAVE LEARNED
trainval/dhMoQrLEJe0/50002 SO WHEN TIDES ARE AT THEIR PEAK STRESS OR WHAT WE CALL THE TIME OF ENCOURAGING STRESS
trainval/DhSoIwxWkkI/50001 AND NO REACHING ACROSS THE TABLE FOR ANY FOOD ITEM
trainval/DhSoIwxWkkI/50002 EVERY FIBER OF MY BODY IS TIGHT
trainval/Diuv3XZQXyc/50001 THAT IS GOOD
trainval/Diuv3XZQXyc/50002 AND THE ANSWER IS YES WE CAN
trainval/Diuv3XZQXyc/50003 ACCORDING TO ONE ESTIMATE THE GATES FOUNDATION HAS ALREADY SAVED 5
trainval/Diuv3XZQXyc/50004 COM AND GIVING WHAT WE CAN BOTH HAVE A SOMEWHAT BROADER LIST BUT YOU CAN FIND
trainval/Diuv3XZQXyc/50005 CHARLIE BRESLER SAID TO ME THAT HE'S NOT AN ALTRUIST
trainval/Diuv3XZQXyc/50006 AND HOLLY MORGAN TOLD ME THAT SHE USED TO BATTLE DEPRESSION UNTIL SHE GOT INVOLVED WITH EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM
trainval/Diuv3XZQXyc/50007 THERE'S ABOUT 100 PEOPLE EACH YEAR IN THE U
trainval/dj4Qk5rUmRw/50001 I LET GO AND DECIDED TO ASK THE READERS OF MY BLOG FOR ADVICE AND LET THEM DECIDE WHICH JOB I WOULD
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50001 IN THE 20 YEARS HENCE THEY'VE PRODUCED 14 MOVIES
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50002 WHEN MANY OF US THINK ABOUT INNOVATION THOUGH WE THINK ABOUT AN EINSTEIN HAVING AN AHA
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50003 LET'S THINK FOR A MINUTE ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE A PIXAR MOVIE NO SOLO GENIUS NO FLASH
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50004 ON THE CONTRARY IT TAKES ABOUT 250 PEOPLE FOUR TO FIVE YEARS TO MAKE ONE OF THOSE
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50005 PARTWAY THROUGH ONE PRODUCTION AN ANIMATOR DREW A CHARACTER WITH AN ARCHED EYEBROW THAT SUGGESTED A
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50006 WHEN THE DIRECTOR SAW THAT DRAWING HE THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50007 BECAUSE THAT ANIMATOR WAS ALLOWED TO SHARE WHAT WE REFERRED TO AS HIS SLICE OF GENIUS HE WAS ABLE
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50008 IT'S A TYPE OF COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING USUALLY AMONG PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIFFERENT EXPERTISE AND DIFFERENT
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50009 INNOVATIVE WORK CAN BE VERY EXHILARATING BUT IT ALSO CAN BE REALLY DOWNRIGHT
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50010 THEY ALSO LEARN HOW TO ADVOCATE FOR THEIR POINT OF VIEW
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50011 IT'S ABOUT DISCOVERY DRIVEN LEARNING WHERE YOU ACT AS OPPOSED TO PLAN YOUR WAY TO THE FUTURE
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50012 PILOTS ARE OFTEN ABOUT BEING RIGHT
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50013 WHEN THEY DON'T WORK SOMEONE OR SOMETHING IS TO BLAME
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50014 THE FINAL CAPABILITY IS CREATIVE RESOLUTION
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50015 THIS IS ABOUT DOING DECISION MAKING IN A WAY THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY COMBINE EVEN OPPOSING IDEAS TO
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50016 WE ENDED UP WITH PAGES AND PAGES AND PAGES OF FIELD NOTES THAT WE ANALYZED AND LOOKED FOR PATTERNS IN WHAT
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50018 ONE BECAME KNOWN AS BIG TABLE THE OTHER BECAME KNOWN AS BUILD IT FROM SCRATCH
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50019 SO THEY SELECTED THAT ONE
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50020 EARLY IN THAT PROCESS ONE OF THE ENGINEERS HAD GONE TO BILL AND SAID WE'RE ALL TOO BUSY FOR THIS INEFFICIENT
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50021 HE ADMITTED IF YOU HAD FORCED US TO ALL BE ON ONE TEAM WE MIGHT HAVE FOCUSED ON PROVING WHO WAS RIGHT
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50022 IT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE MASTERED THE CAPABILITIES REQUIRED FOR THAT
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50023 BUT IF I'M TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S TRULY NEW I HAVE NO ANSWERS
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50024 I DON'T KNOW WHAT DIRECTION WE'RE GOING IN AND I'M NOT EVEN SURE I KNOW HOW TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THERE
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50025 FOR SURE THERE ARE TIMES WHEN VISIONARY LEADERSHIP IS EXACTLY WHAT IS NEEDED
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50026 A WORLD WHERE YOU'RE LIVING AT THE FRONTIER
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50027 WHAT DO THEY FOCUS THEIR TIME ON
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50028 NOT ON CREATING A VISION
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50029 LET'S PUT IN A POLICY THAT ANYONE NO MATTER WHAT THEIR LEVEL OR ROLE IS ALLOWED TO GIVE NOTES TO THE DIRECTOR ABOUT HOW
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50030 WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE DISRUPTORS ALL THE MINORITY VOICES IN THIS ORGANIZATION SPEAK UP
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50031 AND FINALLY LET'S BESTOW CREDIT IN A VERY GENEROUS WAY
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50032 BILL SAID I LEAD A VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50033 THEY WANT TO COCREATE WITH ME THE FUTURE
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50034 THE HEAD OF THE ENGINEERING GROUP AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE GROUP AT THAT TIME WAS A MAN NAMED BILL COUGHRAN
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50035 HOW DID HE SEE HIS ROLE
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50036 I'M NEVER A DICTATOR OF VIEWPOINTS
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50037 ADVICE ABOUT HOW YOU EXERCISE THE ROLE
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50038 AND GUESS WHAT
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50039 BILL AND HIS LEADERSHIP TEAM WHO HE REFERRED TO AS HIS BRAIN TRUST HAD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT THIS
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50040 WE STUDIED A GENERAL COUNSEL IN A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY WHO HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE OUTSIDE LAWYERS
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50041 WHEN WE MET VINEET HIS COMPANY WAS ABOUT IN HIS WORDS TO BECOME IRRELEVANT
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50042 BECAUSE WHAT WAS HAPPENING IS THAT EVERYBODY WAS LOOKING UP AND YOU WEREN'T SEEING THE KIND OF BOTTOM UP INNOVATION
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50043 SO THEY BEGAN TO WORK ON THAT
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50044 INSTEAD OF CREATING A GROUP TO TACKLE THIS TASK THEY DECIDED TO ALLOW GROUPS TO EMERGE
trainval/DjcZrtcBZi4/50045 IF WE WANT TO INVENT A BETTER FUTURE AND I SUSPECT THAT'S WHY MANY OF US ARE HERE THEN
trainval/dJEwC4wCM70/50001 DO YOU HAVE ROACHES IN YOUR HOME
trainval/dJEwC4wCM70/50002 OVER TIME THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL BUT NOT REALLY AS MUCH AS THEY WANT TO BE
trainval/dJEwC4wCM70/50003 IT'S ONE TWO AND THREE
trainval/dJEwC4wCM70/50004 FOR INSTANCE THAT WOULD MEAN THAT WE NEED 25000 UPSTREAMISTS BY THE YEAR 2020
trainval/dJEwC4wCM70/50005 DOCTORS AND NURSES CAN GET BETTER AT ASKING ABOUT THE CONTEXT OF PATIENTS' LIVES NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S BETTER
trainval/dJEwC4wCM70/50006 WE NEED MANY MORE OF THEM IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IF WE'RE TRULY GOING TO HAVE IT BE EFFECTIVE TO MOVE FROM A SICKCARE SYSTEM TO A HEALTHCARE
trainval/DJGreSgaOTc/50001 I JUST THOUGHT THESE ARE THE ACTORS I WANT TO SEE PLAY THESE PARTS
trainval/DJGreSgaOTc/50002 I WANT TO SEE WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE IF THEY READ
trainval/DJGreSgaOTc/50003 WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS
trainval/DJGreSgaOTc/50004 SO I THINK THE INTERESTING THING THAT HAPPENS IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WORLD
trainval/DJGreSgaOTc/50005 BUT FINDING THE GOOD STORIES THE GOOD SHOWS IS HARDER AND HARDER AND HARDER
trainval/DJGreSgaOTc/50006 BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE ONE TINY SHOW OVER HERE ON AMC AND ONE TINY SHOW OVER HERE OVER THERE FINDING WHERE THEY ARE
trainval/DJGreSgaOTc/50007 WE HAVE SOME INTERESTING IDEAS FOR THAT
trainval/DJGreSgaOTc/50008 I'M NOT SURE IF WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THEM IN TIME
trainval/DJGreSgaOTc/50009 I THOUGHT THEY WERE FUN
trainval/DJGreSgaOTc/50010 BUT THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD LIVE TWEET OUR SHOW WAS REALLY JUST US THINKING THAT WOULD BE FUN
trainval/DJGreSgaOTc/50011 I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT WAYS BUT I DON'T KNOW
trainval/DJGreSgaOTc/50012 IMAGINE SITTING NEXT TO HIM OR BEING WITH A CHARACTER LIKE HUCK WHO'S ABOUT TO EXECUTE SOMEBODY
trainval/DJGreSgaOTc/50013 AND INSTEAD OF HAVING A SCENE WHERE YOU KNOW HE'S TALKING TO ANOTHER CHARACTER VERY RAPIDLY HE GOES INTO A
trainval/DJGreSgaOTc/50014 IT'S A LITTLE MORE LIKE THEATER AND I'M NOT SURE IT WOULD WORK BUT I'M FASCINATING BY THE CONCEPT OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN
trainval/DJGreSgaOTc/50015 YOU KNOW IF I'M IN CHARGE OF HOW THE SOPRANOS ENDS THEN THAT'S LOVELY AND I HAVE AN ENDING THAT'S NICE AND SATISFYING BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME
trainval/DJGreSgaOTc/50016 IT'S GETTING A LITTLE BIT DISTURBING
trainval/DJGreSgaOTc/50017 I FIND IT FASCINATING THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY BINGE WATCH YOU CAN'T FAST FORWARD
trainval/DJGreSgaOTc/50018 FOR STORYTELLING OTHER THAN BOOKS
trainval/DJGreSgaOTc/50019 I MEAN I GREW UP WANTING TO BE TONI MORRISON SO NO
trainval/DJGreSgaOTc/50020 I MEAN I DIDN'T EVEN IMAGINE TELEVISION
trainval/DJGreSgaOTc/50021 WE'RE IN THIS SORT OF WILD WEST PERIOD TO ME IT FEELS LIKE BECAUSE NOBODY KNOWS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SETTLE ON
trainval/DJGreSgaOTc/50022 AND HOW DO YOU THINK DOES THAT CHANGE THE STORYTELLING PROCESS AT ALL
trainval/DJGreSgaOTc/50023 I THINK OF STORY IN TERMS OF CHARACTER AND WHAT CHARACTERS WOULD DO AND WHAT CHARACTERS NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM MOVE
trainval/DJGreSgaOTc/50024 AND THAT WAS ALWAYS GREAT EXCEPT NOW IT FELT LIKE THE WHEELS WERE COMING OFF THE BUS AND THINGS WERE ACTUALLY
trainval/DJGreSgaOTc/50025 I WALKED IN AND I WAS LIKE THAT SCENE WHERE OUR MYSTERY WOMAN STARTS SPEAKING RUSSIAN
trainval/DJMhz7JlPvA/50001 THE LAST TIME I WAS AT HIS HOUSE HIS BROTHER SAID HANG ON A SECOND DANIEL'S NOT READY
trainval/DJMhz7JlPvA/50002 THIS IS DESIGN
trainval/DJMhz7JlPvA/50003 YOU WANT TO DESIGN A NEW FRAME FOR A DRONE
trainval/Dk37LhxjPEY/50001 IT WAS ADVERTISEMENT
trainval/dk60sYrU2RU/50001 MAKE YOURSELF UNDERSTOOD TO THE COMPUTER
trainval/dk60sYrU2RU/50002 SO THEY COULD DO THAT ON THEIR OWN
trainval/dk60sYrU2RU/50003 CLARKE WHO SAID I WANT TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON
trainval/dk60sYrU2RU/50004 AND HE SAID YES AND THEY HOP ACROSS THE OCEAN
trainval/dk60sYrU2RU/50005 I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING
trainval/dk60sYrU2RU/50006 IT'S ALL IN ENGLISH AND I'M GOING
trainval/dk60sYrU2RU/50007 AND SHE SAID HOW WOULD I DO THAT
trainval/dk60sYrU2RU/50008 SHE SAID WHAT'S THAT
trainval/dk60sYrU2RU/50009 WHAT IS THAT
trainval/dk60sYrU2RU/50010 CAN YOU DO THAT AGAIN
trainval/dk60sYrU2RU/50011 CAN YOU SHOW ME SOME MORE
trainval/dk60sYrU2RU/50012 THE SCORES WENT UP TO 50 WHICH IS WHAT THE POSH SCHOOLS OF NEW DELHI WITH A TRAINED BIOTECHNOLOGY TEACHER
trainval/dk60sYrU2RU/50013 I SAID YOU MAKE YOUR OWN GROUPS OF FOUR
trainval/dk60sYrU2RU/50014 EACH GROUP OF FOUR CAN USE ONE COMPUTER AND NOT FOUR COMPUTERS
trainval/dk60sYrU2RU/50015 ONE LAST LITTLE BIT AND I'LL STOP
trainval/DKISYPEF0Ls/50001 WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THESE NEXT GENERATION ENERGY SOURCES PEOPLE OFTEN LIKE TO PIT THEM AGAINST EACH OTHER IN A COMPETITION OF
trainval/DKISYPEF0Ls/50002 BUT IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE TO USE PLANT MATTER THAT WE ARE ALREADY PRODUCING SUCH AS AGRICULTURAL
trainval/DKISYPEF0Ls/50003 SO I DECIDED TO PUT IT TO USE BY MAKING IT INTO A PLANT BASED FUEL CALLED BIODIESEL WHICH CAN BE
trainval/DKISYPEF0Ls/50004 IF THEY HAD A SYSTEM WHERE THEY COULD COLLECTIVELY UTILIZE SOLAR AND OTHER RENEWABLE FORMS OF ENERGY AND STORE IT WITHIN
trainval/DKISYPEF0Ls/50005 MOVING FROM A BIG PICTURE VISION TO A DOABLE RESEARCH PROJECT I WANTED TO STUDY HOW ENERGY STORAGE COULD BE
trainval/DKISYPEF0Ls/50006 BUT STILL FROM THE BACKGROUND RESEARCH I READ IN CONVERSATIONS I HAD WITH PROFESSIONALS WORKING WITH SIMILAR
trainval/DKISYPEF0Ls/50007 AND A WHOPPING 81 OF AMERICANS DO ACCORDING TO THE
trainval/DKISYPEF0Ls/50008 MY WORK WAS OF THE CONCEPT CALLED ENERGY INDEPENDENCE
trainval/DKISYPEF0Ls/50009 THIS WOULD GREATLY REDUCE OUR DEPENDENCY ON FOSSIL FUELS AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC COSTS
trainval/DKISYPEF0Ls/50010 THERE ARE A VARIETY OF FREE ONLINE TOOLS THAT CAN HELP YOU GAUGE IF YOUR HOUSE AND ROOF
trainval/DKISYPEF0Ls/50011 THESE ARE CALLED REDOX FLOW BATTERIES
trainval/dkLcwHmnPV4/50001 A YELLOW SIGN
trainval/dkLcwHmnPV4/50002 BUT ALSO THERE SEEMS TO BE A COMPLETE SORT OF GRIDLOCK IN TERMS OF SOLVING THESE SMALL SOLUTIONS
trainval/dkLcwHmnPV4/50003 BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO CAN ACTUALLY SOLVE THEM ACTUALLY ARE TOO POWERFUL AND TOO PREOCCUPIED WITH SOMETHING THEY THINK OF AS
trainval/dkLcwHmnPV4/50004 AND THERE'S TO SOME EXTENT A BIG STRATEGY MYTH THAT'S PREVALENT IN BUSINESS NOW
trainval/dkLcwHmnPV4/50005 BECAUSE IF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONVINCE EVERYBODY THAT THE SUCCESS OF ANY ORGANIZATION IS ALMOST
trainval/dkLcwHmnPV4/50007 HE DEVELOPED AN INTERESTING OUTSOURCING MODEL FOR SEXUAL SERVICES {LG}
trainval/DkocjGrWwvc/50001 AS STORYTELLERS WE KNOW WHAT WE IMAGINE WE'RE LIKELY TO CREATE
trainval/DkocjGrWwvc/50002 WE ARE NOT MEANT TO SAVE THE EARTH WE ARE MEANT TO LEAVE IT BEHIND
trainval/DkocjGrWwvc/50003 A DREAM THAT I HAD NOT LET MYSELF TAKE SERIOUSLY FOR A LONG TIME BEGAN TO TUG AT ME
trainval/DkocjGrWwvc/50004 FROM FRANCE TO HAITI FROM THE STREETS TO OUR HOMES REVOLUTIONARY FREEDOM FIGHTERS HAVE BEEN
trainval/DKSt79dUqJs/50002 IT'S AMAZING IT'S CHALLENGING BUT IT'S ALSO FUN
trainval/DkyMCCnNI3Q/50001 THAT'S WHY IT TAKES MONTHS TO DO ACTUALLY
trainval/DkyMCCnNI3Q/50002 BUT IF YOU WERE TO SIT DOWN AND START BUILDING THAT DAY NOT ONLY WOULD YOU START HAVING YOUR PLANS
trainval/DkyMCCnNI3Q/50003 SO IF YOU ASK A FRIEND FOR MAYBE 100 DOLLARS NOT A BIG DEAL
trainval/DkyMCCnNI3Q/50004 BECAUSE OF THAT IT TAKES A LONG TIME
trainval/DkyMCCnNI3Q/50005 IT USUALLY TAKES 3 4 OR 5 MONTHS
trainval/DkyMCCnNI3Q/50006 AND THEIR MISSION WAS TO MAKE JAMILA'S COMPANY THE MOST INVESTABLE COMPANY IT COULD BE BY THE END OF THAT
trainval/DkyMCCnNI3Q/50007 NOT ONLY DID THEY DO IT ONE TIME EVERY ONE OF THE ENTREPRENEURS HAD 4 SESSIONS LIKE THIS
trainval/DkyMCCnNI3Q/50008 THAT WOULD PROVIDE A STEADY STREAM OF INCOME
trainval/DkyMCCnNI3Q/50009 SO THEY FOUND SOME BOYS HANGING OUT ON THE STREET TALKED WITH THEM
trainval/DkyMCCnNI3Q/50010 AND THEY WERE KIND OF INTERESTED IN CARPENTRY THEY MIGHT PAY 10 PESOS FOR A LESSON IN CARPENTRY BUT
trainval/DkyMCCnNI3Q/50011 NOW WE NEED TO FIND A MECHANIC SO THEY CALLED THEIR 1ST AWAY TEAM AND FOUND A MECHANIC IN TOWN
trainval/DkyMCCnNI3Q/50012 AND HE SAID THAT'S AMAZING
trainval/DkyMCCnNI3Q/50013 THAT WOULD DOUBLE MY INCOME
trainval/DkyMCCnNI3Q/50014 AND IT WOULD BE MORE STABLE FOR ME
trainval/DkyMCCnNI3Q/50015 BUT YOU KNOW ACTUALLY THERE IS A PROBLEM
trainval/DkyMCCnNI3Q/50016 I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF EXTRA CARS AND MOTORCYCLES FOR THEM TO WORK ON
trainval/DkyMCCnNI3Q/50017 I DON'T EVEN KNOW I CAN REALLY TEACH THIS CLASS
trainval/DkyMCCnNI3Q/50018 NOT IN AN ARBITRARY WAY IN A WAY THAT BECAME SO REAL THAT AT THE END OF 3 HOURS WE
trainval/DkyMCCnNI3Q/50019 THEY WEREN'T SERIAL ENTREPRENEURS
trainval/DkyMCCnNI3Q/50020 WHAT IT MEANS TO TRULY SERVE A COMMUNITY
trainval/DkyMCCnNI3Q/50021 WHAT IT MEANS TO TRULY CREATE VALUE BY PEOPLE INTERACTING WITH EACH OTHER
trainval/DL0SgcP15Ts/50001 WE CAN STRIP THAT TISSUE VERY ECONOMICALLY AND SO THIS IS HOW WE CAN GET BIOLOGIC KNEE REPLACEMENT TO
trainval/DLccHLwdS6Q/50001 IT'S TOTALLY OVERWHELMING
trainval/DLccHLwdS6Q/50002 HOW DO YOU COPE WITH THAT
trainval/DLccHLwdS6Q/50003 AND SO HOW AM I GONNA FIT ONE MORE THING AND SOMETHING I AM NOT EVEN AN EXPERT IN
trainval/DLccHLwdS6Q/50004 BEFORE THEY WERE WALKING UP TO 10KM A DAY FOR WATER
trainval/DLccHLwdS6Q/50005 AND NOW THAT A COMMUNITY PROJECT THERE A GRASSROOTS PROJECT HAS PROVIDED THEM WITH
trainval/dLHWVTa5xZs/50001 AND WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT IS ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE GENERATING THROUGH OUR INTERACTION WITH AND OVER THE INTERNET
trainval/dLHWVTa5xZs/50002 WE HAVE PAPER FORMS FOR VACCINATION SURVEYS
trainval/dLHWVTa5xZs/50003 WE HAVE PAPER FORMS TO TRACK PEOPLE WHO COME INTO CLINICS
trainval/dLHWVTa5xZs/50004 WE HAVE PAPER FORMS TO TRACK DRUG SUPPLIES BLOOD SUPPLIES ALL THESE DIFFERENT PAPER FORMS
trainval/dLHWVTa5xZs/50005 NOW TRY AND WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND THAT FOR A SECOND
trainval/dLHWVTa5xZs/50006 YOU JUST HAD TEAMS OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
trainval/dLHWVTa5xZs/50007 NOW 1995 OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS QUITE A LONG TIME AGO
trainval/dLHWVTa5xZs/50008 IT KIND OF FRIGHTENS ME TO THINK OF HOW LONG AGO THAT WAS
trainval/dLHWVTa5xZs/50009 HOW WAS I TRAINING FOLKS AND WHAT WERE THE BOTTLENECKS AND WHAT WERE THE OBSTACLES TO DOING IT FASTER AND TO
trainval/dLHWVTa5xZs/50010 AND UNFORTUNATELY AFTER THINKING ABOUT THIS FOR SOME TIME I IDENTIFIED THE MAIN OBSTACLE
trainval/dLHWVTa5xZs/50011 AND THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT TURNED OUT AND THIS IS A SAD REALIZATION THE MAIN OBSTACLE WAS ME
trainval/dLHWVTa5xZs/50012 IT'S ALWAYS GUYS THAT LOOK PRETTY MUCH LIKE ME FLYING FROM COUNTRIES THAT LOOK PRETTY MUCH LIKE THIS TO OTHER
trainval/dLHWVTa5xZs/50013 AND YOU GO OUT THERE AND YOU SPEND MONEY ON AIRFARE AND YOU SPEND TIME AND YOU SPEND PER DIEM AND YOU
trainval/dLHWVTa5xZs/50014 AS FAR AS I KNEW THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD DISTRIBUTE TECHNOLOGY AND I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT A WAY AROUND IT
trainval/dLHWVTa5xZs/50015 I NEED TO THINK ABOUT THIS MORE
trainval/dLHWVTa5xZs/50016 WHILE I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT PEOPLE STARTED USING EVEN MORE THINGS LIKE THIS JUST AS WE WERE
trainval/dLHWVTa5xZs/50017 THE DEMAND FOR THIS THE NEED FOR DATA TO RUN BETTER PROGRAMS JUST WITHIN HEALTH NOT TO MENTION ALL OF THE
trainval/dLHWVTa5xZs/50018 NOW WE KNEW WHEN WE BUILT THIS SYSTEM THE WHOLE POINT OF IT JUST LIKE WITH THE PALMPILOTS WAS THAT YOU'D BE
trainval/dLHWVTa5xZs/50019 THAT'S LESS THAN I USED TO GET JUST TRAVELING OUT FOR TWO WEEKS TO DO A CONSULTATION
trainval/dLHWVTa5xZs/50020 AND SO I BEGAN TO RACK MY BRAIN TRYING TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WAS THE PROCESS THAT I WAS DOING
trainval/DnbC2Tii0S8/50001 WE MUST REMEMBER THAT NO ONE IS MANDATED TO GIVE OUR CHILDREN ANY TYPE OF AN
trainval/DnbC2Tii0S8/50002 MY INNER CHILD WHO HUNGERED FOR THE EMBRACE OF MY PARENTS LOST TO THE SYSTEM HAD BEGUN TO
trainval/DnbC2Tii0S8/50003 BECAUSE AS A YOUNG BOY I WAS TAUGHT THAT BOYS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE STRONG AND BRAVE
trainval/DnbC2Tii0S8/50004 AN IMAGE OF THE 1
trainval/DnbC2Tii0S8/50005 7 MILLION MINOR CHILDREN WHO HAVE AN INCARCERATED PARENT
trainval/DnbC2Tii0S8/50006 LIFE SKILLS SUCH AS COMMUNICATION RESPONSIBILITY CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS PROBLEM SOLVING
trainval/DnbC2Tii0S8/50007 WE HAVE SONS IN HERE
trainval/DnbC2Tii0S8/50008 I HAVE A SON
trainval/DnbC2Tii0S8/50009 WHAT WAS YOUR MOST MEMORABLE EXPERIENCE YOU AND YOUR DAUGHTER SHARED IN THIS PROGRAM
trainval/DnJHaveemUk/50001 GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY
trainval/DnJHaveemUk/50002 OUR FACULTY DESIGN CUTTING EDGE CURRICULUM
trainval/DnJHaveemUk/50003 BY DESIGN THESE SCHOOLS ATTRACT FAMILIES FROM ACROSS THE
trainval/DnJHaveemUk/50004 SOMETIMES IT HAS FELT LIKE BEATING MY HEAD AGAINST THE WALL
trainval/DnJHaveemUk/50005 SO I CREATED A COURSE IN EDUCATIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP
trainval/DnJHaveemUk/50006 I AM DRIVEN TO PROVIDE THOSE SAME KINDS OF OPPORTUNITIES
trainval/dnMeyvtJpsk/50001 I LIVE BY THAT
trainval/dnMeyvtJpsk/50002 I WAS A MISERABLE CHILD A LONELY ISOLATED RUINED CHILD BY THE TIME I WAS SIX YEARS OLD
trainval/dnMeyvtJpsk/50003 THEN I FOUND A COLLECTION OF DOROTHY PARKER SHORT STORIES
trainval/dnMeyvtJpsk/50004 HOW DID YOU THINK OF IT
trainval/dNoSK3HgQJc/50001 HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD FROM HERE
trainval/dNoSK3HgQJc/50002 SO WITH THAT I WILL LEAVE YOU
trainval/dO6AuQR9R7E/50001 BEAN AND SAFEWAY
trainval/dO6AuQR9R7E/50002 AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT THIS PROBLEM CAN AND IT'S ALREADY BEING FIXED IN POCKETS ACROSS THE
trainval/dO6AuQR9R7E/50003 LET'S CHALLENGE THEM TO TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR HEALTH MORE SERIOUSLY
trainval/dooLZNsHVDY/50001 THESE INNOVATORS ALSO SHARED THREE VERY IMPORTANT TRAITS
trainval/dooLZNsHVDY/50002 WHEN HE SET OUT HE DIDN'T FOCUS ON ALL THE CHALLENGES BETWEEN HIM AND THE SUMMIT
trainval/dooLZNsHVDY/50003 SIR EDMUND HILLARY PICTURED HIMSELF HOLDING THE FLAG OF HIS COUNTRY ON THE HIGHEST POINT IN THE WORLD
trainval/dooLZNsHVDY/50004 HIS VISION LED TO HIS SUCCESS
trainval/dooLZNsHVDY/50005 BUT SIR EDMUND HILLARY DID NOT CLIMB MOUNT EVEREST ALONE
trainval/dooLZNsHVDY/50006 SOME PEOPLE CONSIDER IT AN INSULT FOR SOMEONE WHO'S UNINFORMED OR UNAWARE BUT I CHOOSE TO LOOK
trainval/dooLZNsHVDY/50007 IN THE EARLY DAYS I REMEMBER WE WERE ONLY ABOUT 20 PEOPLE AND I TOLD ONE OF MY GOOD FRIENDS THAT IN A YEAR WE'D BE 50 PEOPLE
trainval/dooLZNsHVDY/50008 I DIDN'T KNOW HOW WE'D DO IT AND I DIDN'T KNOW HOW HARD IT WOULD BE ALL THE CHALLENGES WE'D RUN INTO BUT I WAS DETERMINED TO PROVE HIM WRONG
trainval/dooLZNsHVDY/50009 AND I WAS LUCKY TO WORK FOR SOME GREAT LEADERS WHO EMPOWERED ME TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
trainval/dooLZNsHVDY/50010 I WORKED MY BUTT OFF AND WE GREW OUR TEAM
trainval/dooLZNsHVDY/50011 THE MASS OF ITS BODY AND THE SIZE OF ITS WINGS SHOULD MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE
trainval/dooLZNsHVDY/50012 FIND AN AUDACIOUS GOAL FOR YOURSELF AND FORGET ABOUT ALL THE REASONS WHY NOT
trainval/dOOtM7ZpAS8/50001 I JUMPED STRAIGHT OUT INTO THE WATER
trainval/dOOtM7ZpAS8/50002 I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO ME AFTER THAT
trainval/dOOtM7ZpAS8/50003 THE FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN
trainval/dOOtM7ZpAS8/50004 MOST OF ALL HE WAS DRIVEN BY THE FEAR OF DIVERSITY
trainval/DoRSyk7lA5Q/50001 RUSTY NAILS AND ROTTEN WOOD
trainval/DoRSyk7lA5Q/50002 THESE WEIRD CLEAR BLOBS THAT LOOK LIKE JELLYFISH
trainval/DoRSyk7lA5Q/50003 AND OF COURSE FISH CRAWDADS AND ROCKS WHICH ARE ALL SUPPOSED TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF A LAKE OR
trainval/DoRSyk7lA5Q/50004 EVEN THOUGH I BELIEVE THAT IT'S TERRIBLE THAT PEOPLE TRASH OUR LAKES AND RIVERS THIS ISN'T A TALK ABOUT POLLUTION IT'S
trainval/DoRSyk7lA5Q/50005 THE ONLY REASON I'M ABLE TO INVESTIGATE THE BOTTOMS OF THOSE LAKES AND RIVERS IS BECAUSE I'M A STRONG SWIMMER
trainval/DoRSyk7lA5Q/50006 SWIMMING IS MY WAY INTO THE UNDERWATER WORLD THAT SOME PEOPLE NEVER GET TO SEE
trainval/DoRSyk7lA5Q/50007 BEING IN THE WATER IS NEVER BORING FOR ME BECAUSE I ALWAYS FIND SOMETHING FUN TO DO LIKE DIVING DOWN
trainval/DoRSyk7lA5Q/50008 ONE TIME I WAS GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF SAM PONDS SEARCHING FOR POLLYWOGS WHEN SOMETHING SLIMY BRUSHED UP
trainval/DoRSyk7lA5Q/50009 IT TURNED OUT TO BE A PRETTY GROSS LOOKING PLANT
trainval/DoRSyk7lA5Q/50010 AT THAT POINT I FELT PRETTY RIDICULOUS SO I LOOKED AROUND TO SEE IF ANYBODY WAS WATCHING ME
trainval/DoRSyk7lA5Q/50011 THE TSUNAMI WAVE BOUNCED ALL THE AWAY FROM JAPAN AND HIT HAWAII AND CAUSED A LOT DAMAGE WHERE WE WERE STAYING IN THE KONA
trainval/DoRSyk7lA5Q/50012 THERE WAS NOTHING TO SEE
trainval/DoRSyk7lA5Q/50013 ALL THE FISH WERE GONE
trainval/DoRSyk7lA5Q/50014 WHAT DOES YOUR UNDERWATER WORLD LOOK LIKE
trainval/dOt4NkcmIUg/50001 A HUGE SHOPPING REVOLUTION IS HAPPENING IN CHINA RIGHT NOW
trainval/dOt4NkcmIUg/50002 SHOPPING BEHAVIORS AND ALSO TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS HAVE EVOLVED DIFFERENTLY THAN ELSEWHERE IN
trainval/dOt4NkcmIUg/50003 EVERY MONTH 500 MILLION CONSUMERS ARE BUYING ON
trainval/dOt4NkcmIUg/50004 FIVE YEARS AGO IN A FASHION STUDY WE FOUND THAT ON AVERAGE A CHINESE CONSUMER WOULD BE BUYING FIVE TO
trainval/dOt4NkcmIUg/50005 THEY WERE JUST BROWSING ON THEIR MOBILE SITE AND THEN BUYING WHATEVER THEY SAW
trainval/dOt4NkcmIUg/50006 THESE MICROSTUDIOS ARE REALLY KEY IN THIS OVERALL ECOSYSTEM BECAUSE THEY TAKE SMALL ORDERS
trainval/dOt4NkcmIUg/50007 A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO I WAS SHOPPING WITH A FRIEND IN TOKYO
trainval/dOt4NkcmIUg/50008 THE NEXT MORNING THE DELIVERY UNCLE WILL GIVE IT TO ME WHEN I WAKE UP
trainval/dOt4NkcmIUg/50009 IS THREE TO FOUR TIMES HIGHER THAN THE TRADITIONAL GROCERY STORE AND HALF OF THE REVENUE
trainval/dOt4NkcmIUg/50010 ON AVERAGE A CONSUMER WOULD SPEND ONE HOUR ON THEIR MOBILE PHONE SHOPPING
trainval/dOt4NkcmIUg/50011 THAT'S THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN THE UNITED STATES
trainval/dOt4NkcmIUg/50012 WHERE DOES THE STICKINESS COME FROM
trainval/dOt4NkcmIUg/50013 SO THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE IS LIKE YOU'RE EXPLORING IN AN AMUSEMENT PARK
trainval/dOt4NkcmIUg/50014 IN THIS INTEGRATED ECOSYSTEM SOCIAL MEDIA CAN REALLY REDEFINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
trainval/dOt4NkcmIUg/50015 SO I'VE SEEN SOME EARLY SIGNS THAT THE ECOSYSTEMS ARE SHIFTING THEIR FOCUS TO PAY ATTENTION TO SOLVE
trainval/dOt4NkcmIUg/50016 BUT THERE ARE REALLY NO SIMPLE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS
trainval/dOt4NkcmIUg/50017 THAT IS EXACTLY WHY I'M HERE TO TELL EVERYONE THAT WE NEED TO WATCH IT STUDY IT AND PLAY A PART
trainval/DOvbl3ZPPV4/50001 DO THEY THINK DO THEY FEEL AND IF SO HOW
trainval/doVRMBPUOhA/50001 BUT THEN THE FOLLOW UP QUESTION
trainval/DOYASAY7dO4/50002 WHAT HAPPENS TO OUR TESTOSTERONE
trainval/DqbM1ZrpTQg/50001 SHE AND I WERE BOTH VERY PREGNANT AT THAT TIME AND MY HEART JUST ACHED FOR HER IMAGINING HOW
trainval/DqbM1ZrpTQg/50002 IF YOU DON'T YOU'RE NOT ALONE
trainval/DqbM1ZrpTQg/50003 BOTH TUMORS AND DENSE BREAST TISSUE APPEAR WHITE ON A MAMMOGRAM AND THE X RAY OFTEN
trainval/DqbM1ZrpTQg/50004 WHAT ABOUT ULTRASOUND
trainval/DqbM1ZrpTQg/50005 ULTRASOUND GENERATES MORE BIOPSIES THAT ARE UNNECESSARY RELATIVE TO OTHER TECHNOLOGIES SO IT'S NOT WIDELY
trainval/DqbM1ZrpTQg/50006 AND HE HAPPENED TO TELL ME ABOUT A CONFERENCE HE'D JUST RETURNED FROM IN ISRAEL WHERE THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT A NEW TYPE OF
trainval/DqbM1ZrpTQg/50007 YOU MAY BE SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT MAMMOGRAPHY IS THE ONLY RADIOLOGIC STUDY THAT'S REGULATED BY
trainval/DqbM1ZrpTQg/50008 AND I'M VERY HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WE'RE NOW USING A DOSE OF RADIATION THAT IS EQUIVALENT TO THE EFFECTIVE DOSE FROM ONE
trainval/DqbM1ZrpTQg/50009 WE NEED TO INDIVIDUALIZE SCREENING BASED ON DENSITY
trainval/DqbM1ZrpTQg/50010 FOR WOMEN WITHOUT DENSE BREASTS MAMMOGRAPHY IS THE BEST CHOICE
trainval/DqbM1ZrpTQg/50011 BUT FOR WOMEN WITH DENSE BREASTS WE SHOULDN'T ABANDON SCREENING ALTOGETHER WE NEED TO OFFER THEM SOMETHING
trainval/DqCsQqy9MyU/50001 THEY'D SOMEHOW FIGURED OUT THAT HIGHER UP THE SIGNAL WAS GOOD SO THAT IF THEY CAREFULLY COORDINATED JUMPING AND
trainval/DqCsQqy9MyU/50002 AS THE WORLD BECOMES INCREASINGLY INSTRUMENTED WITH SENSORS WE WANT TO ACTUALLY ALSO TALK TO THE OBJECTS IN OUR LIVES
trainval/DqCsQqy9MyU/50003 IT'S CROWDED THERE'S VERY VERY LITTLE SPACE IT'S REALLY REALLY HARD TO GET ACCESS TO THE EMPTY FREQUENCIES IT'S
trainval/DqCsQqy9MyU/50004 DESPITE THEM BEING EMPTY OR DESPITE THEM BEING LIGHTLY USED NO ONE ELSE EXCEPT THE OWNER OF
trainval/DqCsQqy9MyU/50005 I THINK IT'S REALLY REALLY INTERESTING TO THINK OF THE RESOURCE LIKE THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO TO A LOT OF RESOURCES IN THE WORLD TODAY
trainval/DqCsQqy9MyU/50006 IT'S HARD TO ALLOW OTHER SYSTEMS AND OTHER DEVICES INTO YOUR SPACE
trainval/DqCsQqy9MyU/50007 THE BEST WAY FOR ME TO EXPLAIN THIS AT THE MOMENT IS TO THINK ABOUT THIS VENUE
trainval/DqCsQqy9MyU/50008 BUT IF EVERYONE WAS TO START WHISPERING IT WOULD INTERFERE WITH ME EVENTUALLY
trainval/DqCsQqy9MyU/50009 HOW DO WE DO THAT
trainval/DqCsQqy9MyU/50010 WE TAKE A MOBILE PHONE WHICH IS ALREADY A FAIRLY FANTASTIC AND AMAZING DEVICE WITH HUGE AMOUNT OF CAPABILITIES AND WE
trainval/DqCsQqy9MyU/50011 WE GIVE IT EYES AND EARS BY ADDING SOPHISTICATED SENSORS THAT ALLOW IT TO OBSERVE THE WORLD AROUND IT
trainval/DqCsQqy9MyU/50012 THEY CAN CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR
trainval/DqCsQqy9MyU/50013 IT'S A SOCIABLE RADIO IT'S A SOCIETY OF RADIOS A SOCIAL NETWORK OF RADIOS IS THE WAY I SEE IT
trainval/DqCsQqy9MyU/50014 THE REALITY IS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS OR ENGAGE IN DEBATE ABOUT THEM
trainval/DqCsQqy9MyU/50015 IT'S NEVER ABOUT THE PHYSICAL ENTITY OF THE NETWORK ITSELF
trainval/DqCsQqy9MyU/50016 IN MY OPINION WE IGNORE THE PHYSICALITY OF THE NETWORK THE NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE AT OUR PERIL
trainval/DqCsQqy9MyU/50017 AND ANOTHER TERM FOR THIS IS A USER DEPLOYED INFRASTRUCTURE
trainval/DqCsQqy9MyU/50018 WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT EVERYBODY HERE CAN DEPLOY WIFI
trainval/DqCsQqy9MyU/50019 IF YOU HAVE TO STAND BACK AND ASK WHY THAT IT REALLY IS BECAUSE OF FEAR
trainval/DqCsQqy9MyU/50020 WE DON'T NEED TO BE AN EXPERT
trainval/DqCsQqy9MyU/50021 WE CAN JUST GO OUT AND PUT IT OUT THERE
trainval/DqCsQqy9MyU/50022 WE DON'T NEED TO BE AN EXPERT BECAUSE THE EXPERTEES WILL RESIDE IN THESE RADIOS
trainval/DqCsQqy9MyU/50023 THEY ALSO CHALLENGE HOW WE CONSUME SO WE'RE MOVING AWAY FROM OWNERSHIP TO ACCESS WE'RE MOVING
trainval/DqCsQqy9MyU/50024 THEY FIGURE THINGS OUT THEY DECIDE WHAT INTERFERENCES SOMEBODY DOESN'T TELL THEM WHAT IT IS
trainval/dQijrruP9c4/50001 BUT IT ALSO TAKES A SOFT FRONT THE CAPACITY TO REALLY BE OPEN TO THE WORLD AS IT IS TO HAVE AN
trainval/dQijrruP9c4/50002 MAY WE ACTUALIZE THAT CAPACITY FOR WOMEN EVERYWHERE
trainval/dQJVSnd56n0/50001 THESE ARE ALL SCENARIOS THAT YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO LEAVE YOUR HOME
trainval/dqMj51Ea1K8/50001 OR DO I SHOW MERCY
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50001 AT THAT POINT HIS MOTHER PUT LOCKS ON ALL THE KITCHEN CUPBOARDS BUT STILL HE WAS CRAVING
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50002 SHE GOT FRUSTRATED
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50003 AND AT SOME POINT SHE GET REFERRED TO THE ERASMUS MEDICAL CENTER IN ROTTERDAM
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50004 IT IS LEADING TO DISEASES LIKE DIABETES HEART DISEASE SOME FORMS OF CANCER
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50005 CURRENTLY MEDICAL TREATMENTS ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT FOR PATIENTS LIKE JOHN SO I HOPE TO BEING ABLE TO HELP HIM
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50006 SO WHEN THIS SIGNAL IS NOT ADEQUATELY BEING PROVIDED TO THE BRAIN YOU AUTOMATICALLY EAT MORE
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50007 SO BASICALLY AFTER A CRASH DIET YOU ARE HUNGRIER
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50008 AND THAT'S EVEN SO IN THE LONG TERM
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50009 THE BIOLOGY IS TELLING YOU TO EAT MORE
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50010 THE REASONS ARE SIMPLE
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50011 YOUR BIOLOGY IS DRIVEN BY YOUR THINKING
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50012 BUT THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT WHICH AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF FOOD WE EAT
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50013 BUT THAT WILL ALSO INCREASE YOUR APPETITE
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50014 WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S CAUSING WHAT ACTUALLY BECAUSE THIS SUGAR RICH FOOD SEEM ALSO TO
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50015 SO THE SOLUTION HERE FOR OBESITY ADDITIONAL SOLUTIONS MAY BE TO REDUCE YOUR STRESS LEVEL
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50016 SHE GAINED ACTUALLY A LOT OF WEIGHT 20 POUNDS WITHIN TEN WEEKS AND SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50018 AND REMEMBER YOUR STRESS HORMONES INCREASE YOUR ABDOMINAL FAT
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50019 AND ACTUALLY THIS IS RARE
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50020 BUT STILL PARTICULARLY OBESE PEOPLE USE MORE MEDICATION
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50021 AND THEN TO DISCUSS WHETHER THE DOSE CAN BE REDUCED OR THE MEDICATION CAN MAYBE EVEN STOPPED TO MAKE
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50022 WE ALL KNOW THE WHITE FAT THAT'S WHAT'S ON YOUR HIPS AND YOUR BELLY AND THAT'S UNHEALTHY FAT WHICH IS MAKING YOU SICK
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50023 THEY HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF HAVING A LOT OF BROWN FAT THERE
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50025 BUT IT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THAT AS ADULTS WE ALSO HAVE BROWN FAT
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50026 YOU CAN DO IT EITHER BY EXERCISE WHICH IS HARD IF YOU ARE REALLY MASSIVELY OBESE BUT YOU CAN
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50027 BUT ACTUALLY ALREADY IS ENOUGH IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT IF YOU SPEND FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50028 IN PARTICULAR THE STRESS HORMONE CORTISOL IF YOU ARE STRESSED FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD OF TIME
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50029 ABDOMINAL FAT MASS WILL INCREASE
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50030 IT IS NOW TIME TO NOT LONGER JUDGE PEOPLE WITH OBESITY BUT TO START
trainval/DqsvwHG9cSM/50031 AND THAT'S THE WAY WE WILL COMBAT OBESITY MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY
trainval/dRic5yJC8UY/50001 WELL ONE THING THAT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN UNDER THE LAW IS YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ARRESTED AND JAILED SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU
trainval/dRic5yJC8UY/50002 IN FACT THE WHOLE CELL WAS NEVER CLEANED SO THE FLOOR AND THE WALLS WERE LINED WITH BLOOD AND MUCUS
trainval/dRic5yJC8UY/50003 BUT IF IT WASN'T YOU'D STAY THERE FOR DAYS OR WEEKS AND EVERY DAY THE GUARDS WOULD COME DOWN TO THE CELLS
trainval/dRic5yJC8UY/50004 AND AT THAT POINT THEY'D THINK OK IT'S UNLIKELY THIS PERSON CAN COME UP WITH THE MONEY IT'S MORE LIKELY THIS NEW PERSON WILL
trainval/dRic5yJC8UY/50005 WHEN I MET HIM IN HIS APARTMENT HE HAD NOTHING OF VALUE THERE NOT EVEN FOOD IN HIS FRIDGE
trainval/dRic5yJC8UY/50006 HE CHERISHED THIS A LOT
trainval/dRic5yJC8UY/50007 HE WAS HAPPY TO SHOW IT TO ME
trainval/dRic5yJC8UY/50008 BUT HE CAN'T PAY HIS FINES AND FEES BECAUSE HE HAS NOTHING TO GIVE
trainval/dRic5yJC8UY/50009 SO THEY CALLED THE PARAMEDICS AND THE PARAMEDICS WENT TO THE CELL
trainval/dRic5yJC8UY/50010 THIRTY PERCENT OF WOMEN IN OUR LOCAL JAILS HAVE SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS JUST LIKE HERS BUT ONLY ONE IN SIX
trainval/dRqih1Zz21o/50001 THEREFORE VISUAL PERCEPTION IS A MAJOR PART OF THE NATURAL WORLD
trainval/dRqih1Zz21o/50002 THAT SAID VISUAL PERCEPTION IS NOT VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD NOT ONLY IN ANIMALS BUT EVEN IN
trainval/dRqih1Zz21o/50003 TODAY I AM GOING TO TELL A STORY THAT BEGINS WITH THE OCTOPUS AND TALKS ABOUT SEVERAL ASPECTS
trainval/druJDI6hiiY/50001 SO IT RIGIDLY COUPLES TO YOUR SKULL AND GIVES YOU THE MOST PRECISE POSSIBLE MEASUREMENT OF HOW THE SKULL MOVES
trainval/druJDI6hiiY/50002 PEOPLE HAVE TRIED OTHER APPROACHES WITH HELMETS
trainval/druJDI6hiiY/50003 MOST EXPERTS THINK THAT THAT'S THE CRITICAL FACTOR THAT MIGHT START TO TELL US WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CONCUSSION
trainval/druJDI6hiiY/50006 AND SO THAT DID SOMETHING FIRST THAT WAS A LITTLE COUNTERINTUITIVE
trainval/druJDI6hiiY/50007 HIS HEAD DID NOT MOVE TO THE RIGHT
trainval/druJDI6hiiY/50008 SO THIS LEFT RIGHT MOTION WAS SORT OF A WHIPLASH TYPE PHENOMENON
trainval/druJDI6hiiY/50009 SO WHAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING THERE
trainval/druJDI6hiiY/50010 AND SO WE ARE COLLABORATING WITH A COMPANY IN SWEDEN CALLED H VDING
trainval/druJDI6hiiY/50011 THAT'S A REALITY
trainval/druJDI6hiiY/50012 THEY'RE NOT REGULATED BY THE GOVERNMENT ANYWAY
trainval/druJDI6hiiY/50013 THEY HAVE AN INDUSTRY BODY WHICH IS THE WAY MOST INDUSTRIES WORK
trainval/druJDI6hiiY/50014 AND SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS FOR SOME OF YOU OF MORE IMMEDIATE NATURE I'VE GOT A COUPLE YEARS
trainval/druJDI6hiiY/50015 THERE IS HOPE
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50001 AND HERE'S THE PROBLEM
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50002 THE RATE OF DEPRESSION SEEMS TO BE INCREASING GENERATION AFTER GENERATION
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50003 SO EVERY SUCCESSIVE BIRTH COHORT IS HAVING HIGHER RATES OF DEPRESSION THAN THE ONE THAT
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50004 LEFT UNCHECKED IT'S AN ILLNESS THAT CAN CAUSE BRAIN DAMAGE
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50005 WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50006 WHAT CAUSES DEPRESSION
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50007 A PRIMARY DRIVER
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50008 I CALL IT THE BRAIN'S RUNAWAY STRESS RESPONSE
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50009 I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT RESPONSE
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50010 THE FIGHT OR FLIGHT RESPONSE WAS DESIGNED PRIMARILY TO AID OUR ANCESTORS WHEN THEY
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50011 THEY REQUIRED WHAT
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50012 AND YOU KNOW WHAT HE FOUND
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50013 YEAH I SAID IT
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50014 HERE'S THE THING I LOVE THOUGH
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50015 WORKING OUT WOULD BE CRAZY TO THEM
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50016 EXERCISE IS NOT NATURAL
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50017 I'M NOT SAYING THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY CHANGE SINCE THEN
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50018 THEY HAVE HIGH RATES OF INFANT MORTALITY
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50019 I AM NOT ANTI MEDICATION
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50020 WHAT DID OUR ANCESTORS DO THAT PROTECTED THEM
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50021 AND SO WE DESIGNED A NEW TREATMENT PROGRAM
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50022 I WAS NOT TRAINED AS A PSYCHOTHERAPIST AS AN INTERVENTIONIST RESEARCHER
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50023 THEY DON'T GET SHUT DOWN
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50024 FOR SOME YES
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50025 IT'LL SQUAT DOWN ON ITS HAUNCHES AND THE TREADMILL STARTS TO WEAR THE FUR AND THE SKIN RIGHT OFF ITS BACKSIDE
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50026 AND GUESS WHAT
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50027 BRISK WALKING YOU KNOW THE KIND
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50028 LIKE YOU MIGHT MISS YOUR PLANE
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50029 YOU'VE HEARD OF THEM OMEGA 6S AND OMEGA 3S
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50030 IT'S VERY HEAVILY DEPRESSANT
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50031 THE RESULT IS DEVASTATING
trainval/drv3BP0Fdi8/50032 WE'RE BORN TO CONNECT
trainval/drXnDLHKKPM/50001 IT EXISTS ONLY IN THE MINDS OF ANIMALS WITH EYES
trainval/drXnDLHKKPM/50002 SO THEY'D EVOLVED TO BE VERY VERY EFFICIENT
trainval/drXnDLHKKPM/50003 AND WE STILL DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND HOW OUR IMAGES OF THE WORLD ARE PUT TOGETHER
trainval/drXnDLHKKPM/50004 AND IN FACT THEY DID
trainval/drXnDLHKKPM/50005 IT MOVED VERY QUICKLY AND IT HAD HARD PARTS TO TEAR ANIMALS APART
trainval/drXnDLHKKPM/50006 LIFE SUDDENLY BECAME COMPLEX
trainval/drXnDLHKKPM/50007 THE EFFECT ON THE EYE
trainval/drXnDLHKKPM/50008 IT'S A VERY EFFICIENT LIGHT
trainval/drXnDLHKKPM/50009 YOU CAN IMAGINE PACKING RED BLUE AND GREEN CHROMATOPHORES TOGETHER AND EXPANDING AND CONTRACTING THOSE TO PRODUCE ANY
trainval/drXnDLHKKPM/50010 IN FACT THOSE THAT ARE USED FOR COURTSHIP THOSE IN AREAS OF THE PLUMAGE USED TO ATTRACT A FEMALE THEY'VE
trainval/drXnDLHKKPM/50011 SO IT'S NOT JUST INCIDENTAL OF A YELLOW PIGMENT
trainval/drXnDLHKKPM/50013 SO UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T REVEAL EXACTLY THE PLANS THAT I HAVE NEXT
trainval/DSbtkLA3GrY/50003 WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT
trainval/DSbtkLA3GrY/50004 DJING MCING BREAK DANCING GRAFFITI ART AND THE FIFTH ELEMENT WHICH IS THE ONE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY
trainval/DSbtkLA3GrY/50005 AND WHAT WAS IT ABOUT
trainval/DSbtkLA3GrY/50006 IN PRE EXISTENCE OF THE MATHEMATICAL BIOCHEMICAL EQUATIONS THE MANIFESTATIONS OF ROCK PLANT AIR FIRE
trainval/DSbtkLA3GrY/50009 YOU'RE MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING ALL YOU DO IS BITE IT
trainval/DSbtkLA3GrY/50010 OF COURSE I'M THE ONE WITH THE FORCE
trainval/DSbtkLA3GrY/50011 YOU'RE HISTORY JUST LIKE HENRY IV
trainval/DSbtkLA3GrY/50014 NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY IT WILL NEVER WORK
trainval/DSbtkLA3GrY/50016 I'M THE WORST WITH THE WORDS CAUSE I CURSE ALL MY VERBS
trainval/dScYSVZtB7k/50001 LET'S FIND THESE COMPLEX PROBLEMS
trainval/dScYSVZtB7k/50002 DON'T BE SCARED OF THEM
trainval/dsfROmgVN5U/50001 I REALLY HOPE THAT 100 RENEWABLE IS SOMETHING THAT WE TOGETHER CAN
trainval/dsfROmgVN5U/50002 IT WORKS TRUST ME
trainval/dsfROmgVN5U/50003 IN 1945 AT THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR WE ONLY USED SIX MILLION BARRELS
trainval/dsfROmgVN5U/50004 GENERALLY SPEAKING I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO REDUCE MILITARY SPENDING
trainval/dsfROmgVN5U/50005 NOW WE HAVE THE AMERICAN EMPIRE
trainval/dsfROmgVN5U/50006 YOU KNOW NO MENTIONING THAT THREE TOWERS COLLAPSED THAT'S QUITE A BIG MISTAKE
trainval/dsfROmgVN5U/50007 AS HISTORIANS WE OBSERVE THAT POLITICIANS VERY POWERFUL POLITICIANS TELL US NOT TO
trainval/dsfROmgVN5U/50008 THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY SAY
trainval/DShPct3oIow/50001 UH I'M SORRY WAIT
trainval/dSKkk618ax0/50001 WELL IT'S WHAT WE ARE TAUGHT TO DO
trainval/dskNubEgzCk/50001 BUT I WONDER HOW MUCH WASTE DOES EACH PRODUCE
trainval/dskNubEgzCk/50002 I LOOK IT UP
trainval/dskNubEgzCk/50003 65 POUNDS OF MANURE IN ONE DAY
trainval/dskNubEgzCk/50004 SO NUMBER ONE
trainval/dskNubEgzCk/50005 1275 PEOPLE RESPONDED TO THE SURVEY PROMPT WHAT IS A FAKE PIECE OF HAIR WORN
trainval/dskNubEgzCk/50006 SOME IS BOUGHT
trainval/dskNubEgzCk/50007 AND THIS BRINGS US TO NUMBER THREE
trainval/dskNubEgzCk/50008 BY COMBINING THE DATA INTO ONE LANDSCAPE IT'S EASIER TO INTEGRATE THE THREE TYPES OF DATA
trainval/dskNubEgzCk/50009 THE PHYSICAL WORLD IS OUR FRAMEWORK FOR INTERPRETATION
trainval/dskNubEgzCk/50010 VIRTUAL REALITY COULD CHANGE THIS
trainval/dskNubEgzCk/50011 THIS IS A RICH CAKE
trainval/dskNubEgzCk/50012 I'LL END ON WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT
trainval/dskNubEgzCk/50013 HE SAID THEIR TRACKS WERE SLIGHTLY LARGER
trainval/dsMCVMVTdn0/50001 AND IN DOING SO WE CAN SUDDENLY FOLD ANYTHING
trainval/dsMCVMVTdn0/50002 I CHOSE TO DESIGN A COLUMN
trainval/dsMCVMVTdn0/50003 WOULD THEY SURPRISE US
trainval/dsmgvrcH94U/50001 RAISED QUITE A FEW EYEBROWS IN ICELAND
trainval/dsmgvrcH94U/50002 SO WHAT DO YOU GET
trainval/dsmgvrcH94U/50003 THAT'S HOW WE CHANGE THE WORLD
trainval/dsmgvrcH94U/50004 WE ARE NOT THE SAME AND IT'S GREAT
trainval/dsOSb0SrS5Y/50001 CAN YOU TRUST YOUR NEIGHBORS OR THE NEXT PERSON THAT COMES ALONG
trainval/dsOSb0SrS5Y/50002 CAN YOU TAKE A SWIM IN THE RIVER WITHOUT HEALTH RISKS
trainval/dsOSb0SrS5Y/50003 WHY AM I SO SURE ABOUT THAT
trainval/dsOSb0SrS5Y/50004 PLEASE SHOW US YOUR PAIN AND RESISTANCE AGAINST A FACTOR 10
trainval/dsOSb0SrS5Y/50005 AND IN ONLY FIVE YEARS 1900 COMPANIES HAVE JOINED FROM MORE THAN 40 COUNTRIES
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50001 ONE WAS THAT I WAS NOT GOING TO LET ANYONE ELSE'S DEFINITION OF ME DEFINE ME AND MY
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50002 I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING MEANINGFUL
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50003 I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING ON A BIG SCALE AND I WANTED TO PLUG INTO A PLATFORM THAT WAS REALLY POWERFUL AND
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50005 BUT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN STRANGELY DRAWN TO BUSINESS AND THE POWER OF BUSINESS TO SPREAD IDEAS AND AS A PLATFORM FOR
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50006 SO THIS IS A PICTURE OF CONVENTIONAL THINKING ON LEFT BRAIN RIGHT BRAIN WHICH WE NOW KNOW IS A LOT
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50007 ONE IS THE EXECUTIVE ATTENTION NETWORK WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO FOCUS ON THE TASK AT HAND PROBLEM SOLVE IT'S A
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50008 SO GIVEN THAT THE CORPORATE ENVIRONMENT REALLY ACTIVATES THE EXECUTIVE ATTENTION NETWORK
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50009 DEVELOP YOUR POINT OF VIEW
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50010 THIS IS GOING TO BE THE FOUNDATION AND THE SOUL OF YOUR CREATIVITY
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50011 MY TIP NUMBER TWO IS I LOVE JOURNALING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50012 I FIND THAT DURING THAT INTERSECTION OF DREAMING AND BEING AWAKE I REALLY GET SOME OF MY MOST POWERFUL
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50013 NUMBER 2 IS TO CREATE A SAFE SPACE
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50014 CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTS ARE AMAZING BECAUSE THEY ARE BUSTLING HUBS OF IDEAS AND COLLABORATION
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50015 WHEN YOU HAVE WATCHFUL EYES ON YOU ALL THE TIME IT IS VERY HARD TO TO DO THAT
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50016 WOODY ALLEN GETS HIS BEST IDEAS IN THE SHOWER
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50017 SO JUST FIND TIME AND A SPACE FOR SOLITUDE EVERY DAY AND IT WILL REALLY HELP FEED YOU
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50018 A LOT OF STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT GETTING IN A MORE MINDFUL MEDITATIVE STATE REALLY HELPS YOU ACCESS
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50019 I HAVE DEFINITELY FOUND THAT TO BE TRUE BUT UNFORTUNATELY I CAN NEVER FIND A SOLID 20
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50020 A LOT OF THESE INVOLVE JUST FOR A MINUTE FOCUSING ON YOUR FIVE
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50021 IT WAS LIKE THINGS WERE RECONNECTED IN DIFFERENT WAYS IN MY BRAIN
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50022 SO FOR ME IT WOULD BE MONSTER TRUCKS GUNS AND GARDENING {NS}
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50023 I LOVE THAT TIP
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50024 LEARN THE LANGUAGE OF BUSINESS
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50025 SO THE TOY COMPANY I REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING THAT I WAS WORKING ON WHEN I GOT RUN OVER I ENDED GOING BACK TO IT AND IT
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50026 IT CAN VISUAL YOU CAN WALK OUTSIDE LOOK UP AT A TREE AND JUST REALLY FOCUS ON THAT
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50027 BUT MOST OF US DOING IT WHERE ARTISTS AND WE ACTUALLY LOST CONTROL OF THE COMPANY TO OUR BOARD BECAUSE WE DIDN'T
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50028 IF YOU CAN SPEAK FROM THAT LANGUAGE THEN IT GIVES YOU PERMISSION TO STRAY FROM THAT AND TALK FROM A LANGUAGE OF
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50029 YOU LOOSE CREDIBILITY SO IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50030 MY GOAL FOR ALL YOU CREATIVES OUT THERE IS THAT YOU GET YOUR POINT OF VIEW ACROSS IN THE STRONGEST WAY POSSIBLE AND
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50031 THE NEXT ONE IS BECOME A CURIOUS ANTHROPOLOGIST
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50032 THIS IS THE PRACTICE OF REALLY BEING ABLE TO EMOTIONALLY DETACH FROM WHAT YOU ARE WORKING ON WHICH IS SO HARD AS A
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50033 SO WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS I LIKE TO IS TO PARCEL OUT MY TIME SO I LIKE TO CLUSTER MY CREATIVE ACTIVITIES TOGETHER
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50034 THIS ALLOWS ME TO ACTIVATE MOST EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY THE NETWORK THAT IS MOST APPROPRIATE FOR
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50035 AND FINALLY BE RESILIENT
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50036 THE TOUGH THING ABOUT BEING A CREATIVE IS YOU'RE REALLY SENSITIVE
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50037 SO IN SUMMARY MY GOAL IS THAT THIS MESSAGE GETS SPREAD TO AS MANY ASPIRING CREATIVES
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50038 THESE ALL SOUND REALLY SIMPLE BUT WHEN PRACTICED THEY ACTUALLY HELP YOU CULTIVATE THAT
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50039 SO THANK YOU
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50040 IT IS YOUR JOB AS A CREATIVE TO PUT AS MANY NEW THINGS IN FRONT OF YOU AS POSSIBLE AND MY FAVORITE
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50041 RECENTLY I WENT TO JAPAN AND WHAT WAS INCREDIBLE ABOUT THAT WAS NOT
trainval/DSPWxjBgvF4/50042 WE WERE EATING FISH FOR BREAKFAST THE CUSTOMS WERE TOTALLY DIFFERENT AND WHAT THAT DID IS THAT IT REALLY SLOWED TIME DOWN FOR
trainval/DSSAz5nZBBM/50001 DIVERSITY AND IMMIGRATION DO A LOT OF GOOD THINGS
trainval/DSSAz5nZBBM/50002 AND IF YOU VALUE HAVING A GENEROUS WELFARE STATE YOU'VE GOT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE'RE ALL THE SAME
trainval/DSSAz5nZBBM/50004 SO AMERICA HAD A MID 20TH CENTURY THAT WAS REALLY BIPARTISAN
trainval/DSSAz5nZBBM/50005 LET ME GOOGLE THAT OH MY GOD
trainval/DSSAz5nZBBM/50006 10 MILLION HITS
trainval/DSSAz5nZBBM/50007 LOOK HE WAS
trainval/DSSAz5nZBBM/50008 IT'S HARDER TO FIND SOMEBODY WHO'S ON THE OTHER SIDE
trainval/DSSAz5nZBBM/50009 SO THEY'RE OVER THERE THEY'RE FAR AWAY
trainval/DSSAz5nZBBM/50010 I CAN PUT MYSELF IN YOUR SHOES
trainval/DSSAz5nZBBM/50011 EMPATHY IS TRADITIONALLY FRAMED AS OH I FEEL YOUR PAIN
trainval/DsSrzoyyfF0/50001 SHE'S BEEN THERE FOR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF YEARS
trainval/DsSrzoyyfF0/50002 WHEN I WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING TIMES TO BE WORKING IN NANOTECHNOLOGY
trainval/DsSrzoyyfF0/50003 THERE WERE SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGHS HAPPENING ALL THE TIME
trainval/DsSrzoyyfF0/50004 WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE BLAZING FAST COMPUTERS USING NANOMATERIALS
trainval/DsSrzoyyfF0/50005 I MEAN EVERY LAST DROP
trainval/DsSrzoyyfF0/50006 BUT WHAT IF HE WORKED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
trainval/DsSrzoyyfF0/50007 SO BECAUSE OF THAT ALL OF THE PROMISE AND ALL OF THE EXCITEMENT HAS REMAINED JUST THAT PROMISE AND EXCITEMENT
trainval/DsSrzoyyfF0/50008 WE DON'T HAVE ANY DISEASE FIGHTING NANOBOTS THERE'S NO ELEVATORS TO SPACE AND THE THING THAT I'M MOST INTERESTED
trainval/DsSrzoyyfF0/50009 NOW THAT LAST ONE THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE
trainval/DsSrzoyyfF0/50010 WE JUST HAVE COME TO EXPECT THE PACE OF COMPUTING ADVANCEMENTS TO GO ON INDEFINITELY
trainval/DsSrzoyyfF0/50011 AND IT'S THIS CONVERGENCE THAT GIVES US THIS INCREDIBLE PACE
trainval/DsSrzoyyfF0/50012 YOU WOULD NOT BE IMPRESSED
trainval/DsSrzoyyfF0/50013 IT COULDN'T DO ANYTHING THAT YOUR SMARTPHONE DOES
trainval/DsSrzoyyfF0/50014 THE PROGRESS IS RELENTLESS
trainval/DsSrzoyyfF0/50015 SO OUR GROUP'S ROLE AND OUR GROUP'S MISSION IS TO INNOVATE BY EMPLOYING CARBON NANOTUBES BECAUSE WE THINK THAT
trainval/DsSrzoyyfF0/50016 THIS IDEAL SOLUTION CONTAINS A MATERIAL THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO WORK WITH
trainval/DsSrzoyyfF0/50017 LET'S JUST FIGURE OUT WHAT'S MISSING
trainval/DsSrzoyyfF0/50018 WHAT ARE WE NOT DEALING WITH
trainval/DsSrzoyyfF0/50019 IT'S LIKE IN THE GODFATHER RIGHT
trainval/DsSrzoyyfF0/50020 NOW AS ODD AS THAT SOUNDS THAT IS ALMOST EXACTLY THE PROBLEM I WORK ON IN MY LAB
trainval/DsSrzoyyfF0/50021 WHAT ARE WE NOT DOING BUT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO MAKE THIS A SUCCESS
trainval/DsSrzoyyfF0/50022 AND THE ANSWER IS THAT THE STATUE HAS TO BUILD ITSELF
trainval/DsSrzoyyfF0/50023 I DON'T BUILD WITH STONE I BUILD WITH NANOMATERIALS
trainval/DsSrzoyyfF0/50024 WE JUST DON'T BUILD ANYTHING THIS WAY
trainval/DsSrzoyyfF0/50025 PEOPLE DON'T BUILD ANYTHING THIS WAY
trainval/DsSrzoyyfF0/50027 THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE DONE IN OUR LAB
trainval/dsT5eVSm7BA/50001 WHY WAS I THE ONE BEING REJECTED
trainval/dsT5eVSm7BA/50002 AND IT HAPPENED BY GETTING TO KNOW OTHER PEOPLE'S STORIES AND BEING WILLING TO LET THEM GET TO KNOW MINE
trainval/dsT5eVSm7BA/50003 TO BE HAPPY I STARTED DOING THINGS I WAS PROUD OF
trainval/dsT5eVSm7BA/50004 I WANTED TO BE SPONTANEOUS AND SET MY OWN SCHEDULE
trainval/dsT5eVSm7BA/50005 IT WAS COLD AND I WAS MISERABLE
trainval/dsT5eVSm7BA/50006 I'LL NEVER FORGET IT
trainval/dsT5eVSm7BA/50007 I WAS SITTING AT THIS CAFE IN SAN JOS HAVING A MORNING COFFEE AND I WAS READING A BOOK AND THE
trainval/dsT5eVSm7BA/50008 OH SO YOU THOUGHT BY TRAVELING YOU COULD RUN AWAY FROM YOUR PROBLEMS
trainval/dsT5eVSm7BA/50009 I WAS IN COSTA RICA RUNNING AWAY FROM MY PROBLEMS
trainval/dsT5eVSm7BA/50010 THE TRIP WAS SUPPOSED TO LAST FOR 40 DAYS AND IT LASTED 12 AND THOSE 12 DAYS WERE FULL OF STRESS AND
trainval/dsT5eVSm7BA/50011 FIVE DAYS LATER MY GIRLFRIEND BROKE UP WITH ME
trainval/dsT5eVSm7BA/50012 IT'S FUNNY HOW THESE THINGS WORK SOMETIMES
trainval/dsT5eVSm7BA/50013 I MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS AND I FELT MORE COMFORTABLE TALKING TO PEOPLE BUT THERE WAS STILL ONE
trainval/dsT5eVSm7BA/50014 WHATEVER THEY ARE PURSUE THEM
trainval/dsT5eVSm7BA/50015 EVEN THOUGH I KNEW MORE PEOPLE I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW ANYONE
trainval/dsT5eVSm7BA/50016 FINALLY MY CHALLENGE TO YOU IS THIS
trainval/dsT5eVSm7BA/50017 MINE WAS WHEN I REALIZED THAT IF I COULD CHANGE THE CIRCUMSTANCES I WOULD AND WHEN THAT LIGHT BULB WENT OFF I KNEW
trainval/dsT5eVSm7BA/50018 SO WHAT'S YOUR TURNING POINT GOING TO BE
trainval/dsT5eVSm7BA/50019 YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE THAT CHOICE FOR YOURSELF
trainval/dSykikzbckE/50001 IN FACT SHE HAD A HUGE IMPACT ON MY CAREER
trainval/dSykikzbckE/50002 AND WHEN I SPOKE TO BENAZIR BEFORE SHE WENT BACK SHE TOLD ME ABOUT ALL THE ASSASSINATION THREATS
trainval/dSykikzbckE/50003 BUT WITHIN A MINUTE THERE WAS A MUCH BIGGER BLAST AND THEN THERE WAS ORANGE FLAME EVERYWHERE AND THEN
trainval/DtT6S1vtjzQ/50001 COULD YOU HAVE ASKED FOR A BETTER ANSWER TO PRAYER
trainval/DtT6S1vtjzQ/50002 I KNEW THAT I HAD TO START INVOLVING PATIENTS IN THIS PROCESS OR THEY WOULD NEVER LEARN
trainval/DtT6S1vtjzQ/50003 THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF ALL THIS IS THE DYNAMIC OF GETTING PEOPLE AROUND A TABLE
trainval/DtT6S1vtjzQ/50004 YOU ALL HAVE A CHOICE
trainval/dTwXeZ4GkzI/50001 LET ME READ YOU THE ENTRY
trainval/dTwXeZ4GkzI/50002 P'S PART TO GET ME TO DO THE EXERCISES I DIDN'T WANT TO DO BEFORE THE PROSPECT OF BEING THE RICHEST FIVE YEAR OLD IN THE
trainval/dTwXeZ4GkzI/50003 IN OUR DESIRE TO PROTECT THOSE WE CARE ABOUT BY GIVING THEM THE COLD HARD TRUTH ABOUT THEIR MEDICAL
trainval/dTwXeZ4GkzI/50004 I THINK THE GREATEST ADVERSITY THAT WE'VE CREATED FOR OURSELVES IS THIS IDEA OF NORMALCY
trainval/dTwXeZ4GkzI/50006 I DON'T REMEMBER MEETING YOU
trainval/dTwXeZ4GkzI/50007 HE SAID WELL YOU WOULDN'T REMEMBER MEETING ME
trainval/dTwXeZ4GkzI/50008 OH THAT GUY
trainval/dTwXeZ4GkzI/50009 IT'S CALLED THE STREAMING TRIALS
trainval/dTwXeZ4GkzI/50010 AND OF COURSE THE HEARTBREAKING FLIP SIDE OF THIS STUDY IS THAT THEY TOOK THE A STUDENTS
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50001 THE ERRORS WE MAKE ARE ACTUALLY PREDICTABLE
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50002 WHEN WE GET NEGATIVE FEEDBACK WE STILL THE NEXT TIME WE'RE FACE WITH A CERTAIN CONTEXT TEND TO MAKE THE SAME ERRORS
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50003 WHAT I'M MOST CURIOUS ABOUT IS HOW IS A SPECIES THAT'S AS SMART AS WE ARE
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50004 ONE POSSIBILITY IS IN SOME SENSE IT'S NOT REALLY OUR FAULT
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50005 WE CREATE FINANCIAL MARKETS THAT ARE SUPER COMPLEX
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50006 WE CREATE MORTGAGE TERMS THAT WE CAN'T ACTUALLY DEAL WITH
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50007 WHAT IF WE PUT HOLLY INTO THE SAME CONTEXT AS HUMANS
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50008 DOES SHE MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES AS US
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50009 DOES SHE NOT LEARN FROM THEM
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50010 BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S GREAT FOR US BUT BAD FOR HUMANS
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50011 YOU KNOW WHERE ARE WE ACTUALLY GOING TO START WITH THIS
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50012 SO THAT'S JUST WHAT WE DID
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50013 NOW I'M SEEING LOTS OF SMIRKS OUT THERE
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50014 DON'T WORRY I'M NOT GOING TO CALL ANYONE IN PARTICULAR OUT ON ANY ASPECTS OF YOUR OWN MISTAKES
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50015 THE QUESTION IS IS THIS ANYTHING LIKE HUMAN MONEY
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50016 MAYBE WE SHOULD SEE HOW THEY DO WITH LOSSES
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50017 AND SO WE RAN A SECOND VERSION OF THIS
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50018 AND WHAT WE'D REALLY THOUGHT WE'D DONE IS LIKE WE'D ACTUALLY INTRODUCED SOMETHING THAT AT LEAST FOR THE MONKEYS AND US WORKS LIKE A REAL
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50019 QUESTION IS DO THE MONKEYS START MESSING UP IN THE SAME WAYS WE DO
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50020 THE MONKEYS WOULD RIP OFF THE TOKENS AT EVERY AVAILABLE OPPORTUNITY FROM EACH OTHER OFTEN FROM US YOU KNOW THINGS WE DIDN'T
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50021 CAN WE ACTUALLY SEE IF THE MONKEYS ARE DOING EXACTLY THE SAME DUMB THINGS AS HUMANS DO
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50022 BECAUSE IT'S YOURS NOW YOU CAN BUY WHATEVER YOU WANT
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50023 DONATE IT TAKE IT AND SO ON
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50024 I'M GOING TO GO WITH THAT
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50025 WELL THE SO WHAT
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50026 THEY ACTUALLY TEND TO GO A LITTLE RISKY
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50027 SO WHAT'S GOING ON
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50028 YOU REALLY HAVE TO DO WORK TO FIGURE OUT WELL ONE OPTION'S A THOUSAND 2000 ONE IS 1500
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50029 THEY'RE WHY STOCK INVESTORS HOLD ONTO LOSING STOCKS LONGER BECAUSE THEY'RE EVALUATING THEM IN RELATIVE TERMS
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50030 THEY'RE WHY PEOPLE IN THE HOUSING MARKET REFUSED TO SELL THEIR HOUSE BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO SELL AT A LOSS
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50031 YOU KNOW MAYBE IT'S NOT JUST HUMANS AT THE RIGHT SIDE OF THIS CHAIN THAT'S DUNCEY
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50032 YOU CAN'T JUST SHUT THAT OFF
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50033 THAT LOOKS DISGUSTING TO ME
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50034 AND HERE'S THE RUB
trainval/DUd8XAS5HEk/50035 IT WAS CAMUS WHO ONCE SAID THAT MAN IS THE ONLY SPECIES WHO REFUSES TO BE WHAT HE REALLY IS
trainval/dUdCToPPK5A/50001 THERE S A DEATH ROW FOR LANGUAGES AND IT HAS THREE THOUSAND PRISONERS
trainval/dUdCToPPK5A/50002 WE ALL KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HEAR SONGS FROM OUR CHILDHOOD AND WE REMEMBER EXACTLY WHERE WE WERE
trainval/dUdCToPPK5A/50003 BUT WE MIGHT NOT REMEMBER WHAT WAS ON YOUR SHOPPING LIST YESTERDAY
trainval/dUdCToPPK5A/50004 MY FIRST LANGUAGE WAS RUSSIAN AND I LEARNED HOW TO READ AND WRITE IN RUSSIAN BEFORE ENGLISH
trainval/dUdCToPPK5A/50005 IN THE UNITED STATES WE'VE LOST 55 LANGUAGES SINCE 1997
trainval/dUdCToPPK5A/50006 I'VE GOT SOME PEOPLE RAISING THEIR HANDS
trainval/dUdCToPPK5A/50007 AND WE HAVE ANOTHER 170 LANGUAGES AT RISK OF EXTINCTION
trainval/dUdCToPPK5A/50008 WHICH IN LADINO MEANS TO BANG IF I HAD READ IT IN THE BOOK I PROBABLY WOULDN'T REMEMBER IT
trainval/dUdCToPPK5A/50009 COMPANIES LIKE SESAME STREET AND SCHOOL HOUSE ROCK HAVE SUCCESSFULLY PUT EDUCATIONAL CONTENTS TO
trainval/dUdCToPPK5A/50010 BUT WE RE NOT GONNA STOP THERE
trainval/dUdCToPPK5A/50011 YOU HAVE TO THINK IN A DIFFERENT WAY
trainval/dUdCToPPK5A/50012 WHEN WE LOSE THESE LANGUAGES WE LOSE CENTURIES WORTH OF ART MUSIC HISTORY
trainval/dUdCToPPK5A/50013 I M CO PRODUCING A DOCUMENTARY CALLED SAVED BY LANGUAGE ABOUT A SEPHARDIC BOSNIAN BOY WHO SAVED HIS LIFE
trainval/dV7TJgJmD2g/50001 WHAT TO SAY
trainval/dvuh1Np35Pk/50001 MY ANSWER IS ALWAYS THE SAME
trainval/dvuh1Np35Pk/50002 THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT CHANGE HAS TO BE ABOUT
trainval/dvYYYlgVAao/50001 WELL THAT'S NOT QUITE RIGHT
trainval/DW5YctpK7pM/50001 WHAT WAS GOING GOING ON
trainval/DW5YctpK7pM/50002 WHY DID WE HAVE TO DO THIS
trainval/DW5YctpK7pM/50003 SO AGAIN WE'RE NOT BORN FEMININE OR MASCULINE
trainval/DW5YctpK7pM/50004 WE GENDER OUR KIDS AS SOON AS THEY ARE BORN
trainval/DW5YctpK7pM/50005 THE TOYS THAT KIDS PLAY WITH IMPACT THEIR SENSE OF REALITY AND FEELINGS OF WHAT THEY
trainval/DW5YctpK7pM/50006 BOYS NEED TO BE TOUGH STRONG HARD TOP DOG GET ALL THE CASH AND THE LADIES AND OF COURSE THEY'LL NEVER
trainval/DW5YctpK7pM/50007 AND EVEN IF MEN AS A WHOLE GROUP MIGHT BENEFIT FROM THE CURRENT SYSTEM IT LIMITS OPPORTUNITIES FOR
trainval/DW5YctpK7pM/50008 WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT IT
trainval/DW5YctpK7pM/50009 WE NEED TO CHALLENGE EVERYDAY SEXISM IN THE WORKPLACE AT HOME WITHIN OUR INSTITUTIONS AND WITHIN OUR
trainval/DW5YctpK7pM/50010 GIRLS HAVE MUCH HIGHER RATES OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AND YOUNG WOMEN ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE HOSPITALIZED
trainval/dwbP9iBxkdA/50001 THOUGH FASHION AND ARCHITECTURE CLEARLY AIM TO IDENTIFY CERTAIN CULTURAL AND SOCIETAL IDENTITIES
trainval/dwbP9iBxkdA/50002 FASHION REFERS TO THE ARTICLES ONE WEARS BUT STYLE IS HOW YOU PUT IT TOGETHER AND HOW CONFIDENT YOU FEEL
trainval/DwQMDyyS42Q/50001 HOPEFULLY YOU'LL SEE PAST THE METAL DETECTOR YOU WENT THROUGH THE RAZOR WIRE YOU WALKED PAST AND THE GREEN IDS
trainval/DwQMDyyS42Q/50002 BUT THIS PIECE OF PLASTIC IS JUST THAT
trainval/DwQMDyyS42Q/50003 I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE BAD HAIR DAY
trainval/DwQMDyyS42Q/50004 I'M TALKING ABOUT COMING TO PRISON
trainval/DwQMDyyS42Q/50005 BUT I'M SURE MOST OF YOU CAN AGREE YOU DIDN'T HAVE MUCH SENSE EITHER AT 14
trainval/DwQMDyyS42Q/50006 HERE AT WASHINGTON CORRECTIONS CENTER FOR WOMEN THERE ARE MANY PROGRAMS THAT HELP WOMEN
trainval/DwQMDyyS42Q/50007 I'M JUST GOING TO HIGHLIGHT FOUR OF THESE PROGRAMS
trainval/DwQMDyyS42Q/50008 IT'S BECAUSE OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT I NOW STAND BEFORE YOU WITH THE JOB SKILLS AND THE WORK
trainval/DwQMDyyS42Q/50009 TEXTBOOKS STATE EXAMS MUSIC AND MANY MORE THINGS TO HELP PROVIDE INDEPENDENT LIVING
trainval/DwQMDyyS42Q/50011 SO IT WAS BROUGHT TO THE WASHINGTON STATE SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND'S SUPERINTENDENT FOR ANGELA TO WORK AT THE SCHOOL
trainval/DwQMDyyS42Q/50012 TRADE RELATED APPRENTICESHIP COACHING PROGRAM
trainval/DwQMDyyS42Q/50013 THE TRAC PROGRAM IS A 16 WEEK COURSE THAT TRAINS AND TESTS OFFENDERS IN BECOMING CARPENTERS
trainval/DwQMDyyS42Q/50015 SHE WENT AND TOOK HER INITIAL TESTING ALSO KNOWN AS HELL DAY
trainval/DwQMDyyS42Q/50016 WHEN MARY GOT OUT WITH THE HELP OF HER EMPLOYERS HERE AT WCCW SHE RELEASED DIRECTLY
trainval/DwShSwvxPKs/50001 WHAT IS THIS
trainval/DwShSwvxPKs/50002 THEY CHANGED THEMSELVES INTO HUMANS AND STOLE SOMETHING FROM PEOPLE
trainval/dwU8eavPInw/50001 THEY SIMPLY DON'T HAVE A CONVENTIONAL MILITARY OPTION
trainval/dwU8eavPInw/50002 NOW IS THIS A NEW IDEA
trainval/dwU8eavPInw/50004 BUT YOU NEED TO LOOK AT CONTEXT
trainval/dwU8eavPInw/50005 WE CRITICIZED PEOPLE A LOT IN BOSNIA FOR BEING QUITE SLOW TO TAKE ON WAR CRIMINALS
trainval/dwU8eavPInw/50006 WE'RE NOT MATCHING OUR RESOURCES TO OUR PRIORITIES
trainval/dwU8eavPInw/50007 THE PROBLEM IN LIBYA IS THAT WE ARE ALWAYS PUSHING FOR THE BLACK OR WHITE
trainval/dwU8eavPInw/50008 INSTEAD OF WHICH WE'VE ALLOWED OURSELVES TO BE TEMPTED TOWARDS REGIME CHANGE
trainval/DwYQHj7Hmik/50001 THE AVERAGE PERSON SEES A DOCTOR FOR JUST ABOUT TWO HOURS PER YEAR
trainval/DwYQHj7Hmik/50002 THAT COMES OUT TO ABOUT SEVEN DAYS TOTAL OVER THE COURSE OF YOUR ENTIRE LIFETIME
trainval/DwYQHj7Hmik/50003 WHEN I WALK BY A FAILING SCHOOL I SEE A BODY COUNT
trainval/DWZsOe1j2w0/50001 WHEN DOCTORS FIRST SAW THIS MOOD ENHANCING EFFECT OF IPRONIAZID THEY DIDN'T REALLY RECOGNIZE WHAT THEY
trainval/DWZsOe1j2w0/50002 AND MENTAL SET IS ANOTHER THING
trainval/DWZsOe1j2w0/50003 THAT'S SORT OF THIS PRECONCEIVED FRAMEWORK WITH WHICH WE APPROACH PROBLEMS
trainval/DWZsOe1j2w0/50004 IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT SURPRISING THEY WERE CAUGHT
trainval/DWZsOe1j2w0/50005 THEY HAVE TWO OTHER THINGS IN COMMON THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT
trainval/DWZsOe1j2w0/50006 ONE THEY HAVE TERRIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
trainval/DWZsOe1j2w0/50007 AND THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER RIGHT ONE OR THE TWO MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THAT IMPORTANT BUT THE TWO TOGETHER MEANT THAT WE HAD TO
trainval/DWZsOe1j2w0/50008 AND THAT'S IN THE PATIENTS WHERE THEY DO WORK
trainval/DWZsOe1j2w0/50009 THERE ARE A LOT OF PATIENTS WHERE THESE DRUGS DON'T WORK
trainval/DWZsOe1j2w0/50010 A PAINKILLER WILL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER BUT IS NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO TREAT THAT UNDERLYING DISEASE
trainval/DWZsOe1j2w0/50011 IT DIDN'T REALLY LOOK RIGHT TO ME
trainval/DWZsOe1j2w0/50012 SO WE DID WHAT YOU DO IN SCIENCE WHEN YOU'RE NOT SURE AND WE RAN IT AGAIN
trainval/DWZsOe1j2w0/50013 SO WE RAN IT AGAIN
trainval/DWZsOe1j2w0/50014 AND LIKE I SAID WE ONLY GAVE A TINY AMOUNT OF THE DRUG AND IT LASTED FOR WEEKS AND THAT'S NOT LIKE ANYTHING YOU
trainval/DWZsOe1j2w0/50015 5 TRILLION DOLLARS AND SINCE THEY ARE CHRONIC THAT COST IS COMPOUNDING AND IS THEREFORE
trainval/DWZsOe1j2w0/50016 WE USE IT ON THE BATTLEFIELD
trainval/dXqPaHQp4Xw/50001 DO I HAVE A CHASE BOAT
trainval/dXqPaHQp4Xw/50002 I'M TOTALLY SELF SUPPORTING OUT THERE
trainval/dXqPaHQp4Xw/50003 I BLOGGED ABOUT IT
trainval/dXqPaHQp4Xw/50004 WE HAD A BIT OF A BATTLE OF WILLS
trainval/dXqPaHQp4Xw/50005 BUT IT WAS NOT WITHOUT MISADVENTURE
trainval/dXqPaHQp4Xw/50006 FORTUNATELY HELP WAS AT HAND
trainval/dXqPaHQp4Xw/50007 I HAD A MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT THERE WHO TOLD ME ABOUT HIS EXIT STRATEGY FOR HIS COUNTRY
trainval/dXqPaHQp4Xw/50008 BUT WHAT ABOUT IF WE JUST CHANGE THAT STORY
trainval/dXqPaHQp4Xw/50009 FOR HAPPINESS TO COME AND FIND ME
trainval/dY7iATJVCso/50001 I WAS 18 YEARS OLD AND BORED AND I PICKED UP A BOOK IN THE LIBRARY ON BEES AND I SPENT THE
trainval/dY7iATJVCso/50002 SO BEES HAVE SOCIAL HEALTHCARE
trainval/dY7iATJVCso/50003 IT'S A NATURAL ANTIBIOTIC
trainval/dY7iATJVCso/50004 BEES GET ALL OF THE PROTEIN THEY NEED IN THEIR DIET FROM POLLEN AND ALL OF THE CARBOHYDRATES THEY NEED
trainval/dY7iATJVCso/50005 HOW MUCH IS IT GOING TO TAKE TO CONTAMINATE HUMANS
trainval/dY7iATJVCso/50006 IT MOVES THROUGH THE PLANT SO THAT A CROP PEST A LEAF EATING INSECT WOULD TAKE A BITE OF THE PLANT AND
trainval/dY7iATJVCso/50007 WE NEED A BEAUTIFUL DIVERSITY OF FLOWERS THAT BLOOMS OVER THE ENTIRE GROWING SEASON FROM SPRING TO
trainval/dY9f9bFctUE/50001 SO ACTUALLY CHILDREN CAN BE PROTECTED BY WARM SECURE PARENTING
trainval/dY9f9bFctUE/50002 THEY WATCHED THEIR CHILDREN CHANGE AND THEY HAD NO IDEA HOW TO HELP THEM
trainval/dY9f9bFctUE/50003 THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER THEIR CHILDREN'S QUESTIONS
trainval/dY9f9bFctUE/50004 DESPITE ALL THESE CHALLENGES THEY FACED THEY WERE TRYING TO HELP THEIR CHILDREN
trainval/dY9f9bFctUE/50005 WE MUST PRIORITIZE THESE FAMILIES' NEEDS BOTH THOSE WHO ARE INTERNALLY DISPLACED AND THOSE WHO ARE
trainval/dY9f9bFctUE/50006 THESE NEEDS MUST BE PRIORITIZED BY NGO WORKERS POLICY MAKERS THE WHO
trainval/DZfOvYiQtow/50001 WE HAVE NO IDEA
trainval/DZfOvYiQtow/50002 ELITE ENDURANCE ATHLETES
trainval/DZfOvYiQtow/50003 AND THAT'S A REFERENCE FOR EXAMPLE
trainval/DZfOvYiQtow/50004 DENTISTS LOVE THEM BY THE WAY
trainval/DZfOvYiQtow/50005 THEY HAVE THE MOST DEVELOPED MITOCHONDRIA OF ANY HUMAN
trainval/DZfOvYiQtow/50006 IN THE MITOCHONDRIA AS WELL
trainval/DZfOvYiQtow/50007 SO THEY HAVE AN AMAZING MITOCHONDRIA
trainval/DZfOvYiQtow/50008 THE MAIN REASON IS EXERCISE
trainval/DZfOvYiQtow/50009 GOING BACK TO THE EXAMPLE OF NUTRITION
trainval/DZfOvYiQtow/50010 IF YOU GO IN THIS COUNTRY IN THE U
trainval/DZfOvYiQtow/50011 AND THAT CAUSES MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION
trainval/DZfOvYiQtow/50012 AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW
trainval/DZfOvYiQtow/50013 THAT'S THE GOLD STANDARD THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN BE HEALTHY AND LOSE WEIGHT
trainval/DZfOvYiQtow/50014 WE KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE
trainval/DZfOvYiQtow/50015 THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT RIGHT
trainval/DZfOvYiQtow/50016 SO IT'S WHAT I THINK
trainval/DZfOvYiQtow/50017 I'M NOT AGAINST THAT INDUSTRY OF COURSE BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T EXERCISED IN RECENT MEMORY THAT'S
trainval/DZfOvYiQtow/50018 AND FOR THAT ELITE ENDURANCE ATHLETES IS THE WAY TO GO
trainval/DZfOvYiQtow/50019 EINSTEIN SAID THAT WE CANNOT SOLVE A PROBLEM WITH THE SAME INTELLIGENCE WE HAD WHEN WE CREATED IT
trainval/DZfOvYiQtow/50020 WE'RE NOT CHANGING
trainval/DzNNS4rcIjs/50001 TODAY FARMERS CAN TAKE THOSE SAMPLES THEMSELVES
trainval/DzNNS4rcIjs/50002 EVEN BACTERIA AND SOME VIRUSES HAVE DNA TOO
trainval/DzNNS4rcIjs/50003 YOUR ANIMALS ARE YOUR FAMILY'S SOLE SOURCE OF INCOME AS LONG AS THEY'RE HEALTHY
trainval/DzNNS4rcIjs/50004 OUR GOAL WAS TO BRING DNA SCIENCE TO MORE PEOPLE IN NEW PLACES
trainval/DzNNS4rcIjs/50005 WE STARTED WORKING IN OUR BASEMENTS
trainval/DzNNS4rcIjs/50006 IF IT'S A BAD ENOUGH VIRUS THE HEALTH OF YOUR HERD MAY BE GONE IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE
trainval/DzNNS4rcIjs/50007 AND IT'S A RARE FUNGUS
trainval/DzNNS4rcIjs/50008 LAST YEAR HE TRAVELED TO SIERRA LEONE
trainval/DzNNS4rcIjs/50009 WELL TO ME IT SIGNALS SOMETHING BIGGER THAT DNA TECHNOLOGY IS FINALLY WITHIN THE REACH
trainval/DzNNS4rcIjs/50010 AND IT'S AT TIMES LIKE THIS THAT PROFOUND TRANSFORMATION IS BOUND TO HAPPEN MOMENTS WHEN A
trainval/DzNNS4rcIjs/50011 THE RIPPLES OF THE PERSONAL DNA REVOLUTION MAY BE HARD TO PREDICT BUT ONE THING IS CERTAIN
trainval/DzNNS4rcIjs/50012 PICTURE THAT YOU'RE SEEING 15 SUNSETS AND SUNRISES EVERY DAY
trainval/DZT6YpCsapg/50001 THAT'S ALL TRUE
trainval/DZT6YpCsapg/50002 WE NEED IT TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY
trainval/DZT6YpCsapg/50003 AND THESE ARE NOT ESOTERIC LIMITS
trainval/DZT6YpCsapg/50004 5 EARTHS TO SUSTAIN THIS ECONOMY
trainval/DZT6YpCsapg/50005 I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT FEAR
trainval/DZT6YpCsapg/50007 WE CAN CHOOSE LIFE OVER FEAR
trainval/DzWjaWFLjgg/50001 TAKE IT ON TO THE BATTLE OF KURUKSHETRA
trainval/DzWjaWFLjgg/50002 WE HAVE THE CONCEPT OF DHARMA
trainval/DzWjaWFLjgg/50003 WITH LAKSHMI I ACTUALLY TRIED TO APPROACH IT FROM THE REVERSE
trainval/DzWjaWFLjgg/50004 NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT
trainval/DzWjaWFLjgg/50005 ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE VERY ESSENTIAL
trainval/DzWjaWFLjgg/50006 YEAH I MEAN THIS IS A STORY OF HEROISM AND I SAID
trainval/DzWjaWFLjgg/50007 OK THAT'S MY HOOK
trainval/DZyaRAVcYuY/50001 THAT ALL STARTED WITH A LOCAL TV NEWS CREW COMING TO OUR BOOTH
trainval/DZyaRAVcYuY/50002 BY NOW WE KNEW WHAT WE WANTED TO DO
trainval/DZyaRAVcYuY/50003 AND WE WERE OVER THE MOON
trainval/DZyaRAVcYuY/50004 NOW YOUR PROJECT IS IN THE NATION'S PUBLIC EYE
trainval/DZyaRAVcYuY/50005 AND IT TOUCHED SOMETHING WITHIN THEM
trainval/E0k4IQ8fDCY/50001 I WAS MAD AND DISAPPOINTED
trainval/E0M1beV91js/50001 BUT I HAD COME TO THE EDGE OF SOMETHING MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT THAT WOULD CHANGE MY LIFE
trainval/E0M1beV91js/50002 AND REMEMBER IN THOSE DAYS I KNEW OF NO SUCCESSFUL OUT ROLE MODELS IN THE PERFORMING WORLD
trainval/E0M1beV91js/50003 AS I STARTED TO BUILD MY CAREER AS A PROFESSIONAL VOCALIST I STRUGGLED CONTINUALLY WITH VOCAL
trainval/E0M1beV91js/50004 I WILL NEVER FORGET THE RECOVERY PERIOD WHERE YOU MUST REMAIN COMPLETELY SILENT FOR TWO WEEKS AND WHEN YOU'RE
trainval/E0M1beV91js/50005 SO NOW MORE THAN EVER COMPANIES NEED NOT ONLY DIVERSITY OF IDENTITY AND CULTURE BUT DIVERSITY OF
trainval/E0M1beV91js/50006 SO IN THE AGE OF TRANSPARENCY THAT WE LIVE IN THE INTERNAL AND THE EXTERNAL REALITY OF WHAT A COMPANY
trainval/E0M1beV91js/50007 SO YOU CAN'T BUY THIS KIND OF ENDORSEMENT
trainval/E0M1beV91js/50008 SO IF DIVERSITY IS A PRIORITY IT SHOWS UP IN THE BOTTOM LINE
trainval/E27DY3AVA98/50001 IF ONLY SO I'M UNITED WITH BEX
trainval/E27DY3AVA98/50002 THAT DOESN'T MEAN DRUNKEN TEENS VOMITING UP AND SCREAMING YOLO
trainval/E27DY3AVA98/50004 IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SOUND MENACING
trainval/E27DY3AVA98/50005 SOME PEOPLE WANT TO GET RICH SOME WANT TO GET FAMOUS
trainval/E27DY3AVA98/50006 I LOVE HAVING ADVENTURES BECAUSE I LOVE FEELING FREE
trainval/E27DY3AVA98/50007 I LOVE PEOPLE WHO ARE UP FOR STUFF AND SPONTANEITY
trainval/E3SSSS5SFHQ/50001 I LL PLAY AS HARD AS I CAN
trainval/E3SSSS5SFHQ/50002 THEY CALLED ME CHINESE BOY
trainval/E3SSSS5SFHQ/50003 AND THAT IS AT THE TENDER AGE OF NINE YEARS OLD I THOUGHT OF MYSELF
trainval/E3SSSS5SFHQ/50004 IT WAS MOSTLY ITALIAN AMERICAN
trainval/E3SSSS5SFHQ/50005 I'M NOT GOING TO KNOW ANYONE
trainval/E3SSSS5SFHQ/50006 I DON T KNOW IF I'M GOOD
trainval/E3SSSS5SFHQ/50007 AND OF COURSE I WAS VERY ANGRY
trainval/E3SSSS5SFHQ/50008 SO LAUGH AT YOURSELF
trainval/E3SSSS5SFHQ/50009 I SAID ALL RIGHT
trainval/E3SSSS5SFHQ/50010 I WAS SO EMBARRASSED
trainval/E3SSSS5SFHQ/50011 THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE SPECTATORS THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WATCH FROM THE SIDELINES AND THERE ARE THOSE THAT GIVE THEIR
trainval/E3SSSS5SFHQ/50012 I SAID ALL RIGHT DAD
trainval/E3SSSS5SFHQ/50013 AND MY JOB WAS IN THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
trainval/E3SSSS5SFHQ/50014 GOV FROM THE VIDEO HAD NEVER BEEN TO THE WEBSITE BEFORE
trainval/E3SSSS5SFHQ/50015 IN FACT IT WAS OUR WHOLE ECONOMY
trainval/E3SSSS5SFHQ/50016 WE COULDN'T JUST GO ON THE RADIO HAVE 60 MILLION PEOPLE ACTIVATED
trainval/E3SSSS5SFHQ/50017 WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT
trainval/E3SSSS5SFHQ/50018 GO BACK TO THE WEBSITE AND SIGN UP
trainval/E3SSSS5SFHQ/50019 WE WENT TO THE FUNNIEST PEOPLE ON THE PLANET A COMPANY CALLED FUNNY OR DIE
trainval/e450FJaS3no/50001 SOME OF YOU PROBABLY HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT BEFORE
trainval/e450FJaS3no/50002 NOW THE QUESTION FOR YOU IS
trainval/e450FJaS3no/50003 AND THIS MAKES YOU PHILOSOPHERS
trainval/e450FJaS3no/50004 WHAT ARE THE MANY NUANCES OF PHILOSOPHY THAT PEOPLE THINK AND EXPERIENCE
trainval/e450FJaS3no/50005 THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A CATCH
trainval/e450FJaS3no/50006 NOW AS NEWLY FOUND PHILOSOPHERS I ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ACTIONS REQUIRED OR THE TWO
trainval/e450FJaS3no/50007 THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE DELIBERATION TAKES A LITTLE TIME
trainval/E4ptaIDAIlY/50001 IT'S ACTUALLY NOT
trainval/E4ptaIDAIlY/50002 I STILL LOVE CHICKEN NUGGETS BUT NOW THEY ARE VEGAN
trainval/E4ptaIDAIlY/50003 SHE TOLD ME THAT WE KILLED ANIMALS FOR THEM
trainval/e4PTvXtz4GM/50001 ONE DIGIT AT A TIME I SHALL TRY AND DETERMINE THE DIGIT YOU'VE LEFT OUT
trainval/e4PTvXtz4GM/50002 THE ODDS OF ME GETTING ALL THREE OF THESE RIGHT BY PURE GUESSING WOULD BE ONE IN 1000
trainval/e4PTvXtz4GM/50003 I'M GOING TO TRY TO SQUARE SOME THREE DIGIT NUMBERS
trainval/e4PTvXtz4GM/50004 THIS TIME I WON'T EVEN WRITE THESE DOWN
trainval/e4PTvXtz4GM/50005 NOW LET ME EXPLAIN ONE MORE THING
trainval/e4PTvXtz4GM/50006 IF I DO DON'T TELL ME WHAT THE MISTAKE IS JUST SAY YOU'RE CLOSE OR SOMETHING AND I'LL
trainval/e4PTvXtz4GM/50007 TELL ME IN ADVANCE THE DAY OF THE WEEK
trainval/E5BOBs3Nmbw/50001 SO IF WE LOOK AT THE SYSTEM WE NEED TO SEE
trainval/E5BOBs3Nmbw/50002 DOES IT FEEL RIGHT
trainval/E5BOBs3Nmbw/50003 IT IS THE ARGUMENT OF THE HEART
trainval/E5BOBs3Nmbw/50005 ONE OF THEM IS GOOD
trainval/E5BOBs3Nmbw/50006 ONE OF THEM IS BAD
trainval/E5BOBs3Nmbw/50007 WHEN WE LOOK AT THE FACTS WE SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENT
trainval/E5BOBs3Nmbw/50008 ONE THE MOST DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH TO SURVIVE
trainval/E5BOBs3Nmbw/50009 SO WHAT DID THEY DO
trainval/E6atIJ8RDzU/50001 SO BACK TO THE TRAINING
trainval/E7oq6J8HvKw/50001 AND I BEGAN TO DAYDREAM
trainval/E7sqRrUoL3U/50001 SO FROM TURKEY TO THE GREEK ISLANDS
trainval/E7sqRrUoL3U/50002 AND IT'S ESSENTIAL ALWAYS TO KEEP IN MIND THIS OVERALL AIM THAT UNIFIES YOU WITH PERSONS ALL OVER YOUR COUNTRY
trainval/E7sqRrUoL3U/50003 AND THIS IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF COURSE DAILY WORK ISN'T ALWAYS THE MOST PASSIONATE OR THE MOST
trainval/E7sqRrUoL3U/50004 AND WE ARE CONVINCED THAT REAL CHANGES IN OUR SOCIETY ARE ONLY POSSIBLE WITH THE
trainval/e8JK3qVGuUg/50001 BUT IF YOU WANT TO YOU CAN PUT THIS FLAT MAP ON ANY SCREEN OF ANY DEVICE AND IT WON'T GET
trainval/e8JK3qVGuUg/50002 AND THE SUM OF THE ANGLES OF THAT TRIANGLE WILL BE 180 DEGREES
trainval/e8JK3qVGuUg/50003 SO THE SUM OF THE ANGLES OF THE TRIANGLE ON THIS SPHERE IS MORE THAN 180
trainval/e8JK3qVGuUg/50004 APPARENTLY WE'RE LEARNING THAT THERE ARE SURFACES OF DIFFERENT CURVATURE
trainval/e8JK3qVGuUg/50005 I CAN HEAD ANY DIRECTION
trainval/e8JK3qVGuUg/50006 SO THE LESSON IS THAT SPACES CAN HAVE THE SAME GEOMETRY THE SAME CURVATURE BUT DIFFERENT TOPOLOGIES
trainval/e8JK3qVGuUg/50007 AND GR IS A THEORY ABOUT SPACE AND TIME
trainval/e8JK3qVGuUg/50008 EINSTEIN'S FIELD EQUATIONS WHICH HE ANNOUNCED A HUNDRED YEARS AGO IN 1915 TELL US HOW
trainval/e8JK3qVGuUg/50009 HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THE SAME THING IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE DISTANCES ARE MEASURED IN BILLIONS
trainval/e8JK3qVGuUg/50010 AND WHEN THE UNIVERSE WAS ABOUT 400000 YEARS OLD IT WAS ONLY ABOUT HALF THE TEMPERATURE OF THE
trainval/e8JK3qVGuUg/50011 AND AT THAT POINT THAT PLASMA BECAME A TRANSPARENT GAS
trainval/e8JK3qVGuUg/50012 AS IT LEFT THE LESS DENSE PLACES IT HAD TO CLIMB LESS AND IT LOST LESS ENERGY
trainval/ea3HnhOLC9g/50001 AT THE TIME LONG ISLAND WAS BOOMING BECAUSE ALL THESE WORKING CLASS FAMILIES WERE MOVING FROM THE CITY TO PURSUE THE AMERICAN DREAM OF
trainval/ea3HnhOLC9g/50002 BUT GUESS WHAT
trainval/ea3HnhOLC9g/50003 THERE WAS A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO DID NOT ENJOY THAT BENEFIT
trainval/ea3HnhOLC9g/50004 SO MY DAD TEAMED UP WITH A REPORTER FROM NEWSDAY ONE OF THE LOCAL PAPERS
trainval/ea3HnhOLC9g/50005 HE BROUGHT THESE PEOPLE WITH PICKETS
trainval/ea3HnhOLC9g/50006 THERE WERE BIG SIGNS AND THEY WERE LOUD AND THEY WERE MULTIRACIAL
trainval/ea3HnhOLC9g/50007 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I SAW NAKED BIGOTRY AND RAW IGNORANCE
trainval/ea3HnhOLC9g/50008 AT ONE POINT ONE OF MY FRIENDS SAID TO THE KIDS AND THEY WERE SPEWING RACIAL EPITHETS BEFORE BUSING HAD YOU EVER MET A
trainval/ea3HnhOLC9g/50009 THEN THERE WAS JUST SILENCE
trainval/ea3HnhOLC9g/50010 THAT'S WHERE THE JOBS WERE AT THE TIME
trainval/ea3HnhOLC9g/50011 I BECAME A FINANCIAL ANALYST AND THEN A HEDGE FUND MANAGER
trainval/ea3HnhOLC9g/50012 PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN TO THEM PEOPLE SMARTER THAN I BEFORE ME AND HOPEFULLY AFTER WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THAT
trainval/ea3HnhOLC9g/50013 WHERE IS THE OUTCRY ON A DAILY BASIS
trainval/ea3HnhOLC9g/50014 THE MARSHALL PROJECT IS A NONPROFIT JOURNALISM ORGANIZATION
trainval/ea3HnhOLC9g/50015 AND WE HAVE A SECTION CALLED LIFE INSIDE A WEEKLY COLUMN WRITTEN ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON
trainval/ea3HnhOLC9g/50016 WE NEED TO CREATE A SENSE OF URGENCY AND FOR ME ONE OF THE BEST WAYS OF DOING THAT IS STORIES IS
trainval/ea3HnhOLC9g/50017 SO WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE ALL OF US HERE
trainval/ea3HnhOLC9g/50018 OUR HISTORY OUR VERY RECENT HISTORY IS FULL OF EXAMPLES WHERE JOURNALISM HAD A POWERFUL IMPACT
trainval/eaelI0u4Sz0/50001 THAT YOU'RE GOING INTO AN AUTOMOBILE DEALERSHIP TO BUY A CAR
trainval/eAnHjuTQF3M/50001 FOR ME I HAVE THREE YOUNG BOYS AND I WANT THEM TO HAVE A REALLY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR GRANDPARENTS
trainval/eAnHjuTQF3M/50002 WE TRY SKYPE WE TRY PHONE CALLS BUT MY BOYS ARE LITTLE THEY DON'T REALLY WANT TO TALK THEY WANT TO PLAY
trainval/eAnHjuTQF3M/50003 BECAUSE THE CHALLENGE IS NOT LOSING WEIGHT IT'S ACTUALLY KEEPING IT OFF
trainval/eAnHjuTQF3M/50004 THEY LOVE THE SCREEN
trainval/eAnHjuTQF3M/50005 BUT I WANT THEM TO PLAY AS A MOM I WANT THEM TO PLAY LIKE REAL WORLD PLAY
trainval/EaYS6muHSSI/50001 AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY
trainval/EaYS6muHSSI/50002 AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS THE TINY DIMMING OF LIGHT THAT IS CAUSED BY A PLANET PASSING IN
trainval/EBebWBjpWIQ/50001 WAIT A MINUTE MAYBE THERE S A WHOLE NEW SET OF PARTICLES OUT THERE THAT WE HAVEN T EVEN SEEN
trainval/EBebWBjpWIQ/50002 X RAYS TEND TO GO THROUGH EVERYTHING AND GAMMA RAYS EVEN MORE SO
trainval/EBebWBjpWIQ/50003 REFLECTING GAMMA RAYS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN T DO RIGHT NOW
trainval/EBebWBjpWIQ/50004 MY LAB PARTNER AND I DISCUSSED THIS FOR ABOUT A YEAR
trainval/EBKSa94IFHY/50001 SO IS THAT A GOOD THING
trainval/EBKSa94IFHY/50002 SO IF WE THINK ABOUT THIS PROBLEM THE PROBLEM OF CREATING SOMETHING MORE INTELLIGENT THAN YOUR OWN SPECIES WE
trainval/EBKSa94IFHY/50003 WHAT EXACTLY IS THE PROBLEM
trainval/EBKSa94IFHY/50004 SOMEONE MIGHT SWITCH ME OFF
trainval/EBKSa94IFHY/50005 I WILL DISABLE MY OFF' SWITCH
trainval/EBKSa94IFHY/50006 AND BY VALUES HERE I DON'T MEAN TOUCHY FEELY GOODY GOODY VALUES
trainval/EBKSa94IFHY/50007 LET'S SEE HOW THAT APPLIES TO THIS QUESTION OF CAN YOU SWITCH THE MACHINE OFF
trainval/EBKSa94IFHY/50009 I SNEAK DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND TAKE STUFF FROM THE FRIDGE
trainval/EBKSa94IFHY/50010 AND THERE ARE MANY MANY DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED IN DOING THIS I DON'T EXPECT THAT THIS IS GOING TO GET SOLVED VERY QUICKLY
trainval/EBKSa94IFHY/50011 IN FACT IT'LL JUST HELP YOU SEND YOUR KIDS TO SCHOOL
trainval/EBKSa94IFHY/50012 WELL IT REASONS IN A DIFFERENT WAY
trainval/EBKSa94IFHY/50013 MOST OF WHAT WE WRITE ABOUT IS HUMAN BEINGS DOING THINGS AND OTHER PEOPLE GETTING UPSET ABOUT IT
trainval/EBKSa94IFHY/50014 THAT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE IDEA
trainval/EBKSa94IFHY/50015 STUART CAN I JUST SAY I REALLY REALLY HOPE YOU FIGURE THIS OUT FOR US
trainval/EBKSa94IFHY/50016 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT TALK
trainval/EBKSa94IFHY/50017 THEY ONLY TALK ABOUT KINGS AND PRINCES AND ELITE WHITE MALE PEOPLE DOING STUFF
trainval/ec9GyxEUGec/50001 WORK YOUR WAY UP
trainval/eCknUJJc3qU/50001 AND WE NAIVELY THOUGHT THAT OUR GENERATION WOULD BE THE ONE TO MAKE GENDER INEQUITY A
trainval/eCknUJJc3qU/50002 ALL OF US MALE AND FEMALE ARE UNCONSCIOUSLY GENDER BIASED
trainval/eCknUJJc3qU/50003 SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE BRAIN PROCESSES THAT DRIVE BY US HOW IT SHOWS UP AND MOST
trainval/eCknUJJc3qU/50004 BUT THE PROBLEM WITH THIS PROCESS WHICH ACTUALLY WORKS WELL MOST OF THE TIME IS THAT YOUR BRAIN IS ALSO NOT
trainval/eCknUJJc3qU/50005 SO IT SHOWS UP EVERYWHERE
trainval/eCknUJJc3qU/50006 IN FACT YOU MIGHT EVEN NOTICE SOMETHING TODAY AS A RESULT OF THE LAST 10 MINUTES WE'VE SPENT TOGETHER
trainval/eCknUJJc3qU/50007 DON'T JUDGE IT ENGAGE WITH OTHER PEOPLE
trainval/eCknUJJc3qU/50008 GET CURIOUS AND USE IT TO FUEL AN EXPLORATION
trainval/eCknUJJc3qU/50009 WHEN YOU SEE BIAS OR THE ENVIRONMENTS THAT DRIVE IT SAY SOMETHING TALK ABOUT
trainval/edEs4sjlmJY/50001 OF COURSE THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY
trainval/edEs4sjlmJY/50002 YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE BEST VALUE
trainval/eDFrlV106iM/50001 BUT REAL ACTION
trainval/eDFrlV106iM/50002 SO OVER CHRISTMAS BREAK AT ABOUT 4 A
trainval/EDLWWP8N6MU/50001 BUT THE IDEA BEHIND IT IT'S LIKE A WIKIPEDIA TYPE SITE
trainval/EDLWWP8N6MU/50003 THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT WE CAN ALL DO IN THIS ROOM
trainval/Eeas8QU5TzA/50001 THE OTHERS ARE
trainval/EEjyPqyFeSs/50001 SO FROM THAT POINT THERE WAS A FIT OF OPOSSUM FEVER
trainval/EEjyPqyFeSs/50002 WE WERE JUST GETTING AROUND TO POLISHING OFF THESE LAST WILD PREDATORS
trainval/Eewvsw027jg/50001 SUCCESS IN YOUR LIFE YOUR RELATIONSHIPS IN YOUR FRIENDSHIPS IN YOUR MARRIAGE PARENTING YOUR
trainval/Eewvsw027jg/50002 I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU EAT THAT FOOD AND THAT'S YOUR EXERCISE REGIMEN
trainval/EfXidZmAW1s/50001 IT HONESTLY SCARED ME AND STILL DOES TO THINK THAT IF I WERE TO LIVE FOR SAY
trainval/EfXidZmAW1s/50002 WHEN I FLY I FEEL THE WIND BUFFETING MY FACE
trainval/EfXidZmAW1s/50003 IT'S FOR ME TO TRY AND SLOWLY MAKE UP THAT 25 YEARS THAT I WOULD OTHERWISE
trainval/eG2X0WRrb88/50001 WE NEED TO HAVE AMBITION THEN WE NEED TO SEE WHAT ARE THE
trainval/eG2X0WRrb88/50003 THAT'S WHEN I STARTED TO SEE MY ELEMENTS CLEARLY
trainval/eG2X0WRrb88/50004 WHEN I START TO EMBRACE MY IDENTITY I REALIZE WHAT A BEAUTIFUL THING IT
trainval/eG2X0WRrb88/50005 THERE ARE WOMEN OUT THERE HAVING TO COVER THEMSELVES UP BECAUSE OF TRADITIONS AND
trainval/eg66CMRpKCw/50001 BUT KNOW THAT REVENGE IS AGAINST YOURSELF
trainval/eg66CMRpKCw/50002 IF WE TOOK ALL THE ENERGY WE SPENT ON WAGING WAR AND PUT IT INTO SOLVING OUR DISPUTES INSTEAD OF MAKING MORE THEN MAYBE WE COULD FIX THE PROBLEMS
trainval/EgU3iSg8ZRY/50001 I WANTED IT TO STOP BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW
trainval/EgU3iSg8ZRY/50002 MY CHEST STARTED TO FEEL TIGHT
trainval/EgU3iSg8ZRY/50003 I WAS AT A JOB INTERVIEW
trainval/EgU3iSg8ZRY/50004 YOU CAN'T JUST GET UP AND RUN OUT OF A JOB INTERVIEW
trainval/EgU3iSg8ZRY/50005 ARE YOU GOING TO BE ALRIGHT
trainval/EgU3iSg8ZRY/50006 I COULD NEVER SIT IN BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE
trainval/EgU3iSg8ZRY/50007 WHAT IF SHE'S ANXIOUS LIKE ME
trainval/eH5qxw6Pd1c/50001 FROM ALL THOSE DEVELOPMENTAL INTERACTIONS THAT I'VE SHOWED YOU BEFORE
trainval/eHlu6ViSwxo/50001 SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HOW THEDRESS SPREADS THROUGH A POPULATION
trainval/eHlu6ViSwxo/50002 SO WHY DOES THE DRESS STOP SPREADING
trainval/eHlu6ViSwxo/50003 THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NO LONGER SHARING THE DRESS NEVER QUITE REACHES BACK UP TO A POPULATION OF TEN MILLION
trainval/eHlu6ViSwxo/50004 IT STOPS BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SHARING THE DRESS CAN'T FIND ANY NEW PEOPLE TO SHARE IT WITH
trainval/eHlu6ViSwxo/50005 AND SO THE SHARING NUMBERS DROP TO ZERO
trainval/eHlu6ViSwxo/50006 SO WHILE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO STOP A MEME SUCH AS THEDRESS FROM SPREADING ONCE IT
trainval/eHlu6ViSwxo/50007 IT'S USED TO INVESTIGATE THE CAUSES AND SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND TO HELP DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO
trainval/eHlu6ViSwxo/50008 AND NOT MANY DISEASES OR POPULATIONS BEHAVE QUITE SO SIMPLY
trainval/eHlu6ViSwxo/50009 SO WE CAN RUN VIRTUAL EXPERIMENTS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS LIKE
trainval/eHlu6ViSwxo/50010 HOW MANY CASES COULD WE PREVENT IF WE HAD AN EFFECTIVE VACCINE AGAINST EBOLA FOR EXAMPLE
trainval/eHlu6ViSwxo/50011 THAT ACTUALLY CAUSE DISEASE VIRUSES AND BACTERIA
trainval/eHlu6ViSwxo/50012 BUT INFECTIOUS DISEASES ISN'T THE ONLY APPLICATION OF MATHEMATICS TO HEALTH PROBLEMS
trainval/EhM56Fk2aFk/50001 TODAY I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU ON A VOYAGE TO SOME PLACE SO DEEP SO DARK SO
trainval/EhM56Fk2aFk/50002 AND THIRD IS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT OCEAN BASIN WIDE MANAGEMENT
trainval/EhM56Fk2aFk/50003 AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT YOU ALSO NEED OCEAN BASIN MANAGEMENT REGIMES
trainval/EHTmxmuhZ10/50001 THE BASIC STORY HERE IS THAT WHAT USED TO BE VERTICALLY INTEGRATED OLIGOPOLISTIC
trainval/EHTmxmuhZ10/50002 AND IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION IF WE LOOK SAY AT THE ENERGY SECTOR WHERE ALL THE TALK IS ABOUT HOW
trainval/EHTmxmuhZ10/50003 AND WE NEED INDUSTRY STRUCTURES THAT WILL ACCOMMODATE VERY VERY DIFFERENT MOTIVATIONS FROM THE AMATEUR
trainval/eHzLV1LM4Rs/50001 WITHIN THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS 30000 MORE FUTURE RESIDENTS WILL OUTLIVE THEIR PARENTS THEIR PRIMARY
trainval/eHzLV1LM4Rs/50002 THAT WOULDN'T STOP MY GRANDPARENTS FROM TRYING TO GIVE HIM A MEANINGFUL LIFE EVEN THOUGH THERE WEREN'T
trainval/eIho2S0ZahI/50001 OF COURSE WHERE THIS ALL COMES INTO PLAY MOST OF ALL IS WHEN YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT TO DO
trainval/eIho2S0ZahI/50002 IT MIGHT BE STANDING ON A STAGE LIKE THIS AND GIVING A TALK TO PEOPLE
trainval/eIho2S0ZahI/50003 WE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE WEATHER SPORT ABOUT POLITICS ABOUT EVERYTHING BUT ACTUALLY COMPLAINING IS VIRAL MISERY
trainval/eIho2S0ZahI/50004 IT'S THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN START A WAR OR SAY I LOVE YOU
trainval/eIho2S0ZahI/50005 YOU KNOW SOMEBODY IS BOMBARDING YOU WITH THEIR OPINIONS AS IF THEY WERE TRUE
trainval/eIho2S0ZahI/50006 I MEAN MY GOODNESS YOU LOOK UGLY THIS MORNING
trainval/eIho2S0ZahI/50007 YOU HAVE AN AMAZING TOOLBOX
trainval/eIho2S0ZahI/50008 I'M NOT GOING TO GET VERY TECHNICAL ABOUT THIS FOR ANY OF YOU WHO ARE VOICE COACHES
trainval/eIho2S0ZahI/50009 GO AND GET A VOICE COACH
trainval/eIho2S0ZahI/50010 PEOPLE WHO SPEAK ALL ON ONE NOTE ARE REALLY QUITE HARD TO LISTEN TO IF THEY DON'T HAVE ANY PROSODY AT
trainval/eIho2S0ZahI/50011 AND THEN ROLL AN R
trainval/eIho2S0ZahI/50012 THIS IS A SERIOUS POINT HERE
trainval/eIho2S0ZahI/50013 THAT WOULD BE A WORLD THAT DOES SOUND BEAUTIFUL AND ONE WHERE UNDERSTANDING WOULD BE THE
trainval/EijI8QaExDg/50001 I TOSSED OUT THE SHINY MARY JANES AND BROUGHT IN THE TIMBERLAND BOOTS
trainval/EijI8QaExDg/50002 I THREW AWAY THE TOOTHBRUSHES WITH PRINCESSES ON THEM AND BROUGHT IN THE ONES WITH SPIDER MAN
trainval/EijI8QaExDg/50003 AND PENELOPE WITHOUT MISSING A BEAT SAID NO MAMA I DON'T FEEL LIKE A BOY
trainval/EijI8QaExDg/50004 I THOUGHT MAYBE I HAD DONE SOMETHING WRONG AS A PARENT
trainval/EijI8QaExDg/50005 HAD I FORGOTTEN TO TEACH SELF PRIDE
trainval/EijI8QaExDg/50006 HAD I FORGOTTEN TO TEACH FEMINISM
trainval/EijI8QaExDg/50007 I COULD ONLY THINK ABOUT GENDER LIKE WHAT IS A MAN
trainval/EijI8QaExDg/50008 I MAKE MY BED FIVE MINUTES AFTER I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING
trainval/EijI8QaExDg/50009 I LOVE FOR MEN TO OPEN THE DOOR FOR ME BUT I INSIST ON CARRYING MY OWN LUGGAGE
trainval/EijI8QaExDg/50010 THEY TELL US IF WE CAN INTER BE IF WE CAN GET ALONG
trainval/EijI8QaExDg/50011 THEY'RE KIND OF LIKE THE HOW AND THE WHY WE TICK
trainval/EijI8QaExDg/50012 SO IN MY FAMILY HAIR IS LOVE
trainval/EijI8QaExDg/50013 SO I RARELY UNDERSTAND THEM ANYWAY
trainval/EijI8QaExDg/50014 I THINK IN MY OPINION HUMANS WANT THE WORLD TO BE SAFE AND SMALL AND SO OUR LANGUAGE OFTENTIMES REFLECTS THAT
trainval/EijI8QaExDg/50015 AND I'M NOT GOING TO ANY BLACK COLLEGE FOR THAT MATTER
trainval/EijI8QaExDg/50016 BUT EVENTUALLY I HAD TO LET GEORGIA TO FIND FEMALE BLACKNESS FOR HERSELF AND THEN SUPPORT IT
trainval/EijI8QaExDg/50017 NOT EVERYONE IN MY HOUSE AGREES ON THE TOPIC OF GENDER AND I ALLOW FOR THAT
trainval/EijI8QaExDg/50018 THIS IS THE WAY GOD MADE ME
trainval/EijI8QaExDg/50019 AS A WOMAN AS A BLACK PERSON I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE MISLABELLED
trainval/EijI8QaExDg/50020 I HEARD A QUOTE THAT I REALLY LIKE
trainval/EijI8QaExDg/50021 GO BEYOND WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TAUGHT TO BE AS A WOMAN AND BE ANYTHING OR EVERYTHING
trainval/EijI8QaExDg/50022 AND THEN YOU MAY ASK WELL IF WE GO BEYOND GENDER WHERE WILL WE END UP AS A SOCIETY AS A COMMUNITY AS
trainval/EijI8QaExDg/50023 WE'LL BE ABLE TO IMAGINE BEYOND
trainval/EijI8QaExDg/50024 BABY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CHANGE YOUR NAME TO SOMETHING MORE BOYISH SOMETHING THAT CAN ALLOW PEOPLE TO
trainval/EiqqvJgSG7o/50001 NOT TO BE SLIPPED INTO NOW AND AGAIN
trainval/EiqqvJgSG7o/50002 AND THEN FLUNK THEM TO THE SIDE SOMEWHERE
trainval/EiTrl0W1QrM/50001 WE KNOW WE HAVE THAT
trainval/EiTrl0W1QrM/50002 THE AMERICANS HAVE EVEN RECOGNIZED IT IN AN AGREEMENT
trainval/EiTrl0W1QrM/50003 AND WE CONTINUE TO GROW
trainval/EiTrl0W1QrM/50004 AND THAT MAKES US LARGER THAN THE U
trainval/EiTrl0W1QrM/50005 AS A TELEPHONE MARKET
trainval/EiTrl0W1QrM/50006 BUT SOMETIMES IT JUST SAT THERE
trainval/EiTrl0W1QrM/50007 BUT HE'S CARRYING A 21ST CENTURY INSTRUMENT
trainval/EiTrl0W1QrM/50008 THE OTHER DAY I WAS IN KERALA MY HOME STATE AT THE COUNTRY FARM OF A FRIEND ABOUT 20 KILOMETERS AWAY FROM
trainval/EiTrl0W1QrM/50009 AND IT WAS A HOT DAY AND HE SAID HEY WOULD YOU LIKE SOME FRESH COCONUT WATER
trainval/EiTrl0W1QrM/50010 AND HE WHIPPED OUT HIS CELLPHONE DIALED THE NUMBER AND A VOICE SAID I'M UP HERE
trainval/EiTrl0W1QrM/50011 AFGHANISTAN WE KNOW WHAT A SERIOUS SECURITY PROBLEM AFGHANISTAN IS FOR SO MANY OF US IN THE WORLD
trainval/EiTrl0W1QrM/50012 I HAVE READ A REUTERS DISPATCH SO THIS IS NOT INDIAN PROPAGANDA A BRITISH NEWS AGENCY ABOUT HOW ROBBERS IN THE
trainval/EiTrl0W1QrM/50013 RATHER THAN MINDING THE STORE
trainval/EiTrl0W1QrM/50014 I MEAN THE PROLIFERATION OF INDIAN RESTAURANTS SINCE I FIRST WENT ABROAD AS A STUDENT IN THE MID 70S AND WHAT
trainval/EiTrl0W1QrM/50015 IN FACT LEGEND HAS IS THAT WHEN DOUBTING THOMAS THE APOSTLE SAINT THOMAS LANDED ON THE SHORES OF
trainval/EiTrl0W1QrM/50016 BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THAT ELECTORAL OUTCOME HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD
trainval/EiTrl0W1QrM/50017 IT WAS ESSENTIALLY INDIA BEING ITSELF
trainval/EiTrl0W1QrM/50018 GOVERNMENTS AREN'T VERY GOOD AT TELLING STORIES
trainval/EiTrl0W1QrM/50019 THAT IS A 21ST CENTURY STORY AS WELL AS AN ANCIENT ONE
trainval/EiTrl0W1QrM/50020 WE CAN'T REALLY BE BOTH OF THOSE
trainval/eJ89At9Xxws/50001 WHAT I NEEDED TO DO WAS GET FOOD OUT TO A BROADER SPECTRUM OF PEOPLE
trainval/eJ89At9Xxws/50002 PERHAPS MORE WORKING CLASS OR PERHAPS PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN A COOPERATIVE
trainval/eJ89At9Xxws/50004 IT WAS LIKE VEGETABLE JERKY AND KILLED ALL OF THEM
trainval/eJ89At9Xxws/50005 I'M JUST ABOUT TO DO FIRE
trainval/eJb3Z2RmRMo/50001 BUT MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE OF THE LATTER ONE
trainval/eJb3Z2RmRMo/50002 MAYBE THERE'S A PROBLEM
trainval/eJCTAXbSBWs/50001 BUT THIS IS NO ORDINARY WELL
trainval/eJnlgDUcxOQ/50001 4 MILLION IT IS AS BIG AS IT HAS EVER BEEN
trainval/eJnlgDUcxOQ/50004 AND THE REASON IS THAT WE WANTED THIS TO BE A REALLY IMPORTANT STATION WITHIN THE WEST END BECAUSE FROM HERE RATHER THAN
trainval/eJnlgDUcxOQ/50005 HIS TRADEMARK IS A STRIPE IT'S AN 87 MIL STRIPE THAT HE USES
trainval/eJnlgDUcxOQ/50007 SO TO GO TO COVENT GARDEN YOU GOT THE COLOURFUL ONES
trainval/EjSuaeVfE9I/50001 AND YOU GOT IT WRONG
trainval/eJZSzNuKX7c/50001 AND PROBABLY THE THIRD TIME YOU WILL COME DIRECTLY TO THIS ROOM WITHOUT GETTING LOST BECAUSE YOU'VE MEMORIZED
trainval/EKSF037iji0/50001 NOT COOL BRO
trainval/EKSF037iji0/50003 HOW DO WE GET THERE
trainval/EKSF037iji0/50004 WE'D LIKE TO SEE IT
trainval/EKSF037iji0/50005 TWITTER ALREADY DOES THIS
trainval/EKSF037iji0/50006 YOU CAN NOT ONE CLICK RE TWEET A PROTECTED TWEET
trainval/EKy19WzkPxE/50001 THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO GET AWAY FROM
trainval/EKy19WzkPxE/50002 IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T WANT TO FEEL SOMETHING EMOTIONALLY
trainval/EKy19WzkPxE/50003 WE WANT THE WHOLE RANGE OF FEELINGS
trainval/EL9TBKSdHXU/50001 EVERY MINISTRY EVEN JUDGES HAD TO BE INVOLVED IN AIDS EDUCATION EVERYONE AND WE SAID THE PUBLIC
trainval/EL9TBKSdHXU/50002 THE WOMEN SAID WE AGREE
trainval/EL9TBKSdHXU/50003 AND THIS PICTURE WAS SENT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
trainval/EL9TBKSdHXU/50004 UNCLE BUYS A CONDOM
trainval/EL9TBKSdHXU/50005 VERY GOOD UNCLE
trainval/EL9TBKSdHXU/50006 AND THEN THE FOOD IS EITHER HAMBURGER OR HOTDOG
trainval/EL9TBKSdHXU/50007 I SAID DON'T WORRY
trainval/EL9TBKSdHXU/50008 WE DIDN'T HAVE A STRONG GOVERNMENT
trainval/EL9TBKSdHXU/50009 WE DIDN'T HAVE LOTS OF DOCTORS
trainval/EL9TBKSdHXU/50010 BUT IT'S EVERYBODY'S JOB WHO CAN CHANGE ATTITUDE AND BEHAVIOR
trainval/EL9TBKSdHXU/50011 AND THEY'D ENJOY IT IMMENSELY I SEE THEM STANDING AROUND RIGHT NOW EVERYWHERE
trainval/EL9TBKSdHXU/50012 SO WE HAVE NOW FOUND THE WEAPON OF MASS PROTECTION
trainval/ELET24AHnEg/50001 IT'S THAT STORY THAT I'D LIKE TO EXPLORE WITH YOU TODAY
trainval/ELET24AHnEg/50002 FOR MANY YEARS I WAS A BELIEVER IN THE PLACENTAL ORIGINS AND SUFFERED FROM SOMETHING CALLED CONFIRMATION BIAS
trainval/ELgvDMTKyBE/50001 YOU'RE HAVING TO IMAGINE IT
trainval/ELgvDMTKyBE/50002 NOW THAT'S A REALLY SERIOUS PROBLEM
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50001 THERE'S SOME CONFUSION ABOUT THE TERM GENDER
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50002 AND LET ME ILLUSTRATE THAT CONFUSION BY WAY OF ANALOGY
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50003 AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN THEY HEAR THE WORD GENDER THINK IT MEANS WOMEN
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50004 THAT'S A GOOD ENGLISH SENTENCE
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50005 I DON'T SEE THESE AS WOMEN'S ISSUES THAT SOME GOOD MEN HELP OUT WITH
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50006 WE'VE GONE FROM JOHN BEAT MARY TO MARY WAS BEATEN BY JOHN
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50007 WE'RE NOT EVEN THINKING ABOUT JOHN IT'S TOTALLY FOCUSED ON MARY
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50008 WHY DO THEY KEEP GOING BACK
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50009 WHY WAS SHE DRINKING WITH THOSE GUYS IN THAT HOTEL ROOM
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50010 WHY IS THAT A COMMON PROBLEM IN OUR SOCIETY AND ALL OVER THE WORLD TODAY
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50011 WE HEAR ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50012 THAT'S A VERY NAIVE NOTION RIGHT
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50013 PERPETRATORS ARE MUCH MORE NORMAL THAN THAT AND EVERYDAY THAN THAT
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50014 SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE IN OUR SOCIETY AND IN THE WORLD
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50015 WHAT ARE THE ROLES OF VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS IN HELPING TO PRODUCE ABUSIVE MEN
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50016 HOW DOES ALL THIS WORK
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50017 HOW CAN WE CHANGE THE SOCIALIZATION OF BOYS AND THE DEFINITIONS OF MANHOOD THAT LEAD TO THESE CURRENT OUTCOMES
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50018 WHAT ABOUT ALL THOSE BOYS
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50019 WHAT ABOUT ALL THE YOUNG MEN AND BOYS WHO HAVE BEEN TRAUMATIZED BY ADULT MEN'S VIOLENCE
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50020 YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50021 AND IF WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT MALE VICTIMS LET'S TALK ABOUT MALE VICTIMS
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50022 MOST MALE VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE ARE THE VICTIMS OF OTHER MEN'S VIOLENCE
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50023 SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT BOTH WOMEN AND MEN HAVE IN COMMON
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50024 WE ARE BOTH VICTIMS OF MEN'S VIOLENCE
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50025 WE DON'T LIKE IT WHEN PEOPLE CHALLENGE OUR POWER
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50026 I'M USING THE GENDER BINARY
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50027 AND THERE ARE WOMEN WHO ARE PERPETRATORS AND OF COURSE THERE ARE MEN WHO ARE VICTIMS
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50028 THERE'S A WHOLE SPECTRUM
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50029 WHAT DO WE DO
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50030 HOW DO WE SPEAK UP
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50031 HOW DO WE CHALLENGE OUR FRIENDS
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50032 HOW DO WE SUPPORT OUR FRIENDS
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50033 BUT HOW DO WE NOT REMAIN SILENT IN THE FACE OF ABUSE
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50034 NOW WHEN IT COMES TO MEN AND MALE CULTURE THE GOAL IS TO GET MEN WHO ARE NOT ABUSIVE TO CHALLENGE MEN WHO ARE
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50035 JUST LIKE WITH HETEROSEXISM IF YOU'RE A HETEROSEXUAL PERSON AND YOU YOURSELF DON'T ENACT HARASSING OR ABUSIVE BEHAVIORS TOWARDS
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50036 AND IF WE CAN GET TO THE PLACE WHERE MEN WHO ACT OUT IN SEXIST WAYS WILL LOSE STATUS YOUNG MEN AND BOYS WHO
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50037 WE'LL SEE A RADICAL DIMINUTION OF THE ABUSE
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50038 BECAUSE THE TYPICAL PERPETRATOR IS NOT SICK AND TWISTED
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50039 THERE'S BEEN AN AWFUL LOT OF SILENCE IN MALE CULTURE ABOUT THIS ONGOING TRAGEDY OF MEN'S VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND CHILDREN
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50040 BUT ON A BIG SCALE WE NEED MORE ADULT MEN WITH POWER TO START PRIORITIZING THESE ISSUES
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50041 AND SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY HE NEEDS SENSITIVITY TRAINING
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50042 OTHER PEOPLE WILL SAY WELL GET OFF IT
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50043 WE KNOW ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WE CAN EASILY DO THAT
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50044 BY THE WAY WE OWE IT TO WOMEN
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50045 THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50046 BUT WE ALSO OWE IT TO OUR SONS
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50047 WE ALSO OWE IT TO YOUNG MEN WHO ARE GROWING UP ALL OVER THE WORLD IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY DIDN'T MAKE THE CHOICE TO BE A
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50048 I KNOW WE CAN DO IT WE CAN DO BETTER
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50049 IT'S UNBELIEVABLE REALLY
trainval/ElJxUVJ8blw/50050 BUT WHEN YOU GET INTO IT YOU REALIZE THERE ARE PRESSURES ON MEN
trainval/eLrBw8BKOWI/50001 BECAUSE IN OUR PLASTIC AGE PLASTIC IS EVERYWHERE IT'S EVEN HIDDEN IN PRODUCTS WHERE WE NEVER EXPECTED IT TO
trainval/eLrBw8BKOWI/50002 I'LL TELL YOU WHY
trainval/eLrBw8BKOWI/50003 I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU THE FIRST ONE FIRST ONE IS IT'S REALLY ECO FRIENDLY
trainval/eLz9TvxGoKs/50001 HE THOUGHT NATURE WOULD PROTECT US FROM THEIR FORMATION
trainval/eLz9TvxGoKs/50002 IT WAS DECADES BEFORE THE TERM BLACK HOLE WAS COINED AND PEOPLE REALIZED THAT BLACK HOLES ARE REAL
trainval/eLz9TvxGoKs/50003 IT'LL BRING US THAT MUCH CLOSER TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE BIG BANG WHICH BRINGS US THAT MUCH CLOSER TO
trainval/ema8O7xqjvk/50001 THEY REDUCED THE FOOTPRINT FROM 1700 MILES TO 700 MILES
trainval/ema8O7xqjvk/50002 WE ARE NOT GOING TO FEED OUR WAY OUT OF POVERTY
trainval/eMdh57x1UBQ/50001 WHAT IF WE CREATE A CULTURE OF SELFLESSNESS
trainval/eMdh57x1UBQ/50002 SO WHEN A CITY ALSO STARTS WITH LEADERSHIP IT STARTS AT OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS IT STARTS WITH OUR BOSSES IT STARTS WITH
trainval/eMdh57x1UBQ/50003 WE RECOGNIZED THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE DOWNTOWN ON MARTIN LUTHER KING BOULEVARD ON ONE SIDE
trainval/emeEpzkf044/50001 I REMEMBER LOOKING UP HOW MUCH A TYPICAL DESIGNER MAKES AND THINKING HOW CAN I AFFORD A NICE
trainval/emeEpzkf044/50002 WHAT ABOUT MONEY
trainval/emeEpzkf044/50003 WHAT ABOUT STABILITY
trainval/emeEpzkf044/50004 BUT WHY DID I TRAVEL ALL AROUND THE WORLD WITHOUT HOPPING ON A SINGLE PLANE
trainval/emeEpzkf044/50005 QUESTION WHY DID I TRAVEL
trainval/emn28FrJ6CI/50001 YOU KNOW GIVE US A GO
trainval/emn28FrJ6CI/50002 WE DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT
trainval/emn28FrJ6CI/50003 THAT WAS A CHALLENGE WE HAD TO FACE AS PHYSICISTS
trainval/emn28FrJ6CI/50004 HOW DO WE EXPLAIN THIS
trainval/eMSonXncSjA/50001 SHE CAN WALK AND NOW NOT ONLY THAT I MEAN SHE PLAYS BASKETBALL SOFTBALL GYMNASTICS YOU NAME IT
trainval/eMSonXncSjA/50002 AND IF YOU ASK HER SHE WILL SAY SHE IS EXTREMELY GRATEFUL FOR THE FACT THAT SHE CAN DO ALL THESE THINGS
trainval/eMSonXncSjA/50004 SO WHERE DID IT ALL BEGIN
trainval/eMSonXncSjA/50005 IN 1967 WE SAW THE FIRST HEART TRANSPLANTATION FIRST ARTIFICIAL HEART CAME LATER
trainval/eMSonXncSjA/50006 BUT THE PROBLEM WAS AND ALANA WILL TELL YOU IS THAT THERE'S SCAR TISSUE WHENEVER YOU PUT ANYTHING
trainval/eMSonXncSjA/50007 THE BODY SORT OF TREATS IT AS AN INVADER AND BEGINS TO ATTACK IT
trainval/eMSonXncSjA/50008 AND SO THESE KIND OF IMPLANTS LED TO A LOT OF REALLY INTERESTING WORK WITH CELLS AND WITH
trainval/eMSonXncSjA/50009 BUT THAT'S IN THE FUTURE
trainval/eMSonXncSjA/50010 WHAT CAN WE DO NOW
trainval/eMSonXncSjA/50011 BONES YOU MIGHT IMAGINE ARE MECHANICALLY ACTIVE IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT BONE TISSUE ENGINEERING YOU SEE A
trainval/eMSonXncSjA/50012 SURGEONS WERE ABLE TO REBUILD HER KNEE FROM A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT SOURCES
trainval/eMSonXncSjA/50013 WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR ANIMAL TESTING AND REDUCE THE NEED FOR HUMAN TESTING
trainval/eMSonXncSjA/50014 SHE GOT A DONOR PATELLA
trainval/eMSonXncSjA/50015 SHE HAD A PIECE OF HER HAMSTRING FASHIONED INTO TWO LIGAMENTS
trainval/eMSonXncSjA/50016 SHE HAD TWO BIOPOLYMER LIGAMENTS AND METAL BUMPERS TO HOLD EVERYTHING TOGETHER
trainval/eMSonXncSjA/50017 BUT IMAGINE I MEAN GETTING BACK TO THE RAT THE RAT IS A WHOLE ORGANISM AND AS
trainval/eMSonXncSjA/50018 AND COLLABORATORS OF OURS AT TUFTS ARE USING MODELS LIKE THESE WITH TISSUE ENGINEERED BONES TO
trainval/eMSonXncSjA/50019 0 IS GOING TO BE
trainval/eMSonXncSjA/50020 OK SO THAT'S ENGINEERING HEALTHY HUMAN TISSUES BUT WHAT IF WE COULD ENGINEER TISSUES THAT REPLICATE A
trainval/eMSonXncSjA/50021 KEVIN EGGAN FROM HARVARD IS DOING JUST THAT TAKING CELLS FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE GENES FOR
trainval/eNC1h5H5cJA/50001 IT'S ESSENTIALLY THIS VIRTUAL MAP THAT ONLY EXISTS IN YOUR BRAIN
trainval/eNC1h5H5cJA/50002 ALL ANIMAL SPECIES DO IT EVEN THOUGH WE ALL USE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TOOLS
trainval/eNC1h5H5cJA/50003 MAYBE YOU'VE HAD THAT EXPERIENCE AS WELL
trainval/eNC1h5H5cJA/50004 IN THE 1930S HARRY BECK APPLIED THE PRINCIPLES OF
trainval/eNC1h5H5cJA/50005 SO THAT'S WHAT I DID
trainval/eNC1h5H5cJA/50006 JAMES WANTED TO USE BUS RAPID TRANSPORT FOR THAT RATHER THAN LIGHT RAIL
trainval/eNDhBSR1DZ0/50001 30 YEARS FROM NOW
trainval/eNDhBSR1DZ0/50002 I HAD TO GO TO VIETNAM TO LEARN IT BUT I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN IT AND ALL OF YOU SHOULD KNOW IT BECAUSE IT IS THE
trainval/eNDhBSR1DZ0/50003 I WANT TO STAY IN VIETNAM
trainval/eNDhBSR1DZ0/50004 AND THERE WERE STILL 25 THOUSAND KHMER ROUGE ALL OVER THE COUNTRYSIDE
trainval/eNDhBSR1DZ0/50005 BECAUSE IN THE 1860S IT WAS UNDERSTOOD HOW THE TWO WENT TOGETHER AND WHAT IMPACT THEY
trainval/eNDhBSR1DZ0/50006 ROADS AND RICE
trainval/eNDhBSR1DZ0/50007 ROADS AND WHEAT
trainval/eNDhBSR1DZ0/50008 YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
trainval/eNDhBSR1DZ0/50009 THAT'S WHAT ALLOWED MY MIRACLE WHEAT TO GET OUT TO PEOPLE
trainval/eNDhBSR1DZ0/50010 THAT'S WHAT TRANSFORMS RURAL AREAS
trainval/eNDhBSR1DZ0/50011 SO WE HAD THIS BOND THAT KEPT US TOGETHER
trainval/eNDhBSR1DZ0/50012 WHERE THE ROAD ENDS THE INSURGENCY BEGINS
trainval/eNDhBSR1DZ0/50013 I WAS INVITED TO ADDRESS THE UNITED NATIONS ON WORLD FOOD DAY
trainval/eNDhBSR1DZ0/50014 I'M TELLING THEM THESE STORIES AND I SAID LOOK AFRICA AND SOUTH ASIA ARE GOING TO BE FACING
trainval/eNDhBSR1DZ0/50015 THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS CAME TO DES MOINES TO HELP PRESENT OUR
trainval/eNDhBSR1DZ0/50016 THEY WANTED TO KNOW HOW THEY COULD BUY A COPY OF THAT STATUE OF BORLAUG AND PUT IT UP ON THEIR CAMPUS
trainval/eNDhBSR1DZ0/50017 I DON'T WANT TO STUDY LABOR RELATIONS
trainval/eNDhBSR1DZ0/50018 I DON'T WANT TO GO TO WESTERN EUROPE
trainval/enW2OUGzqtQ/50001 THAT'S THE WAY IT IS
trainval/Eo9bb3U9wPs/50001 IT BLOWS MY MIND
trainval/Eo9bb3U9wPs/50002 IT'S THE MOTHER OF CURIOSITY
trainval/Eo9bb3U9wPs/50003 IT S ONE OF THE GREAT GIFTS THAT WE GET
trainval/eOvG4ZXQxUU/50001 SO HOW DO WE DO THIS
trainval/eOvG4ZXQxUU/50002 AND THE MUCK
trainval/eOvG4ZXQxUU/50003 SO WHY IS IT
trainval/Ep2MAx95m20/50001 I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE COUPLES IN MY PRACTICE
trainval/Ep2MAx95m20/50002 WOMEN DO NOT HAVE A CORNER ON THE LOW LIBIDO MARKET
trainval/Ep2MAx95m20/50003 AND SHE PROMISED SHE WOULD DO BETTER
trainval/Ep2MAx95m20/50004 IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF A BREAKTHROUGH FOR THEM
trainval/Ep2MAx95m20/50005 I'M NOT TRYING TO BE FUNNY
trainval/Ep2MAx95m20/50006 WE HAVEN'T HAD SEX IN SIX WEEKS
trainval/Ep2MAx95m20/50007 HE NEEDS TO RECOGNIZE THAT THOSE THINGS WILL TURN HER ON
trainval/Ep2MAx95m20/50008 I HAD A GREAT ORGASM
trainval/Ep2MAx95m20/50009 WE ENJOYED EACH OTHER
trainval/Ep2MAx95m20/50010 THE FIRST IS DESIRE
trainval/Ep2MAx95m20/50011 THE THIRD STAGE
trainval/Ep2MAx95m20/50012 SEX IS A POWERFUL WAY OF CONNECTING AND BONDING WITH SOMEBODY YOU LOVE
trainval/EpFCykE9Lk0/50001 AND HOW TERRIBLE THEIR MISTAKES WERE
trainval/EpFCykE9Lk0/50002 MUCH HAS CHANGED MUCH HAS GAINED BUT MUCH HAS BEEN LOST
trainval/EpFCykE9Lk0/50003 AND IF WE BREAK IT IF SOMEONE BREAKS IT WE ALL WILL STARVE
trainval/EpFCykE9Lk0/50004 IS IT EVEN ONE PERSON JOB
trainval/EpFCykE9Lk0/50005 WHY DON'T I SHARE WITH OTHERS
trainval/Eq1Aes1SWMU/50001 SO OUR APOLOGIES
trainval/eQdFkSSgHYo/50001 GDP HAS NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT
trainval/eQdFkSSgHYo/50002 BUT IS HAPPINESS REALLY WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A GOOD SOCIETY
trainval/eQdFkSSgHYo/50003 IT'S GOOD TO BE HAPPY BUT HAPPINESS IS NOT A COMPLETE MEASURE OF A GOOD SOCIETY
trainval/eQdFkSSgHYo/50004 USING 50 DIFFERENT INDICATORS WE BRING TOGETHER ALL THESE DIFFERENT FACTORS TO CREATE A SCORE FOR A
trainval/eQdFkSSgHYo/50005 BUT WE CAN ACTUALLY DRILL DOWN FURTHER
trainval/eQdFkSSgHYo/50006 THE SECOND THING TO NOTICE
trainval/eQdFkSSgHYo/50007 THAT'S BASIC HUMAN NEEDS
trainval/eQdFkSSgHYo/50008 IT SEEMS THAT THE BASIC EDUCATION SCHOOLING SYSTEM IS NOT PERFORMING AS WELL AS IT SHOULD BE
trainval/eQdFkSSgHYo/50009 THAT'S WHAT THE DATA SAYS
trainval/eQdFkSSgHYo/50010 INTERNET MOBILE PHONES ETC
trainval/eQdFkSSgHYo/50011 AGAIN THAT'S AN INTERESTING FINDING
trainval/eQdFkSSgHYo/50012 EVERY REGION IS UNDERPERFORMING THERE
trainval/eQdFkSSgHYo/50013 BY THE WAY ANALYSING THE DATA WE SEE A VERY STRONG RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50001 THERE'S ANOTHER TRADITION THAT THINKS IT'S OPPOSED TO THIS BUT ACCEPTS THE WORST ASSUMPTION
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50003 AND I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH SOME OF THEM
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50004 ONE CONSCIOUSNESS DOES NOT EXIST
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50005 IT'S AN ILLUSION LIKE SUNSETS
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50006 SO CONSCIOUSNESS IS AN ILLUSION
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50007 NOW WHY IS THAT CURIOUS
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50008 TWO WELL MAYBE IT EXISTS BUT IT'S REALLY SOMETHING ELSE
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50009 IT'S A COMPUTER PROGRAM RUNNING IN THE BRAIN
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50010 HOW COULD SPIRITUALITY MOVE ANYTHING
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50011 NOW WHENEVER SOMEBODY TELLS ME THAT I THINK YOU WANT TO SEE SPIRITUALITY MOVE SOMETHING
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50012 I'M GOING TO TELL YOU HOW THAT'S POSSIBLE
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50013 NOW I HAVEN'T YET GIVEN YOU A DEFINITION
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50014 YOU CAN'T DO THIS IF YOU DON'T GIVE A DEFINITION
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50015 PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY CONSCIOUSNESS IS VERY HARD TO DEFINE
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50016 WE'RE NOT READY FOR A SCIENTIFIC DEFINITION BUT HERE'S A COMMON SENSE DEFINITION
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50017 DREAMS ARE A FORM OF CONSCIOUSNESS ON THIS DEFINITION
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50018 NOW THAT'S THE COMMON SENSE DEFINITION
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50019 THAT'S OUR TARGET
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50020 IF YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50021 AND JUST AS THE JAR FULL OF WATER CAN GO FROM LIQUID TO SOLID DEPENDING ON THE BEHAVIOR
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50022 YOU CAN'T GET RID OF IT
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50023 BUT FOR THAT DISTINCTION BETWEEN HOW THINGS CONSCIOUSLY SEEM AND HOW THEY REALLY ARE YOU CAN'T MAKE THAT DISTINCTION FOR
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50024 I GAVE YOU A SCIENTIFIC DEMONSTRATION BY RAISING MY HAND BUT HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50025 NOW WHAT THAT TELLS US IS THAT OUR TRADITIONAL VOCABULARIES FOR DISCUSSING THESE ISSUES ARE
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50026 MAYBE WE'LL BE ABLE TO BUILD A CONSCIOUS MACHINE
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50027 ONE AND THE SAME EVENT HAS A LEVEL OF DESCRIPTION WHERE IT'S NEUROBIOLOGICAL AND ANOTHER LEVEL OF
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50028 IT'S REALLY A DIGITAL COMPUTER PROGRAM RUNNING IN YOUR BRAIN AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO CREATE
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50029 YEAH FORGET ABOUT THE HARDWARE
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50030 ANY HARDWARE WILL DO PROVIDED IT'S RICH ENOUGH AND STABLE ENOUGH TO CARRY THE PROGRAM
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50031 SINCE WE DON'T KNOW HOW OUR BRAINS DO IT WE'RE NOT IN A POSITION SO FAR TO BUILD A CONSCIOUS MACHINE
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50032 BUT WE KNOW THAT THAT'S PURELY SYNTACTICAL
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50033 IS THAT ABSOLUTE LIKE FORCE AND MASS AND GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50034 OR IS IT OBSERVER RELATIVE
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50035 I ADD TWO PLUS TWO TO GET FOUR
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50036 THAT'S GOING ON NO MATTER WHAT ANYBODY THINKS
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50037 BUT WHEN I HAUL OUT MY POCKET CALCULATOR AND DO THE CALCULATION THE ONLY INTRINSIC PHENOMENON
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50038 NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN COMPUTATION IS ARBITRARY
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50039 BUT WE HAVE THIS PERSISTENT CONFUSION BETWEEN OBJECTIVITY AND SUBJECTIVITY AS FEATURES OF
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50040 SO THE OBJECTION THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE AN OBJECTIVE SCIENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS BECAUSE IT'S
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50041 SO I DON'T JUST HAVE THE SIGHT OF THE PEOPLE IN FRONT OF ME AND THE SOUND OF MY VOICE AND THE WEIGHT OF MY SHOES AGAINST THE FLOOR
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50042 I WON'T DEMONSTRATE PAIN BEHAVIOR BUT I CAN TELL YOU I'M NOT HAVING ANY PAINS RIGHT NOW
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50043 YOU'RE GIVING UP ON 300 YEARS OF HUMAN PROGRESS AND HUMAN HOPE AND ALL THE REST OF IT
trainval/eqDgt12m26c/50044 AND THE MESSAGE I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH IS CONSCIOUSNESS HAS TO BECOME ACCEPTED AS A
trainval/eR22lqzdIHU/50002 THEY'RE GREAT FOR CATCHING YOU UP TO CERTAIN HEIGHTS
trainval/eR22lqzdIHU/50003 BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS THAT WAY
trainval/eR22lqzdIHU/50004 SPRING OFF THE THING AND FLY THROUGH THE AIR AND HOPEFULLY YOU MAKE IT LOOK GOOD
trainval/eR22lqzdIHU/50005 WELL YOU'D DIE IF YOU DID THAT
trainval/eR22lqzdIHU/50006 SO I'VE BEEN STUCK
trainval/eR22lqzdIHU/50007 IF YOU'RE AT 100000 FEET YOU DIE
trainval/eR22lqzdIHU/50008 YOUR BLOOD TRIES TO BOIL
trainval/eR22lqzdIHU/50010 THE BODY SWELLS UP
trainval/Er9bh94f1w0/50001 I DECIDED EARLY ON THAT MY INTELLECT WAS MY TICKET OUT AND I WORKED HARD IN AND OUT OF
trainval/Er9bh94f1w0/50002 I WON A SCHOLARSHIP TO WORK AT AN OBSERVATORY AND STUDY WITH A PROFESSIONAL ASTRONOMER
trainval/Er9bh94f1w0/50003 THE RESEARCH I DID WITH HER SUPPORT WON ME A TOP SPOT IN THE WESTINGHOUSE SCIENCE TALENT SEARCH
trainval/Er9bh94f1w0/50004 THINK ABOUT IT
trainval/Er9bh94f1w0/50005 NO ONE PERSON CAN DESIGN VERY COMPLEX OBJECTS ALL BY
trainval/Er9bh94f1w0/50006 SO I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE NIGHT SKY
trainval/erBJuxVR7IE/50001 BUT THERE IS MORE TO IT
trainval/erBJuxVR7IE/50002 JUST THINK ABOUT IT
trainval/erBJuxVR7IE/50003 TO ADAPT TO THE 24 HOUR LIGHT DARK CYCLE OR DAY NIGHT CYCLE ON OUR PLANET ALMOST EVERY
trainval/erBJuxVR7IE/50004 CIRCADIAN LIGHTING AT HOME FACTORIES OFFICES WILL PROMOTE ALERTNESS AND IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY
trainval/erBJuxVR7IE/50005 AND IN FACT RIGHT NOW THERE IS NEW CIRCADIAN LIGHTING IN OUR INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION TO
trainval/ErexJkoDhGI/50001 WE SLAUGHTERED THEM
trainval/ErexJkoDhGI/50002 THEY THOUGHT THIS IS INCREDIBLE
trainval/ErexJkoDhGI/50003 AND JUST AS EVERYBODY GOT EXCITED ABOUT IT BANG
trainval/ErexJkoDhGI/50004 AND NORMALLY WHEN WATER FREEZES AS YOU KNOW IT EXPANDS AND THE SAME THING HAPPENS IN A CELL
trainval/ErexJkoDhGI/50005 IT ACTUALLY DIDN'T LOOK BAD
trainval/ErexJkoDhGI/50006 THE CELL WALLS LOOKED INTACT
trainval/ErexJkoDhGI/50007 THAT WAS A MIRACLE BUT IT WAS WORKABLE
trainval/ErexJkoDhGI/50008 WE'VE LOST A WHOLE FAMILY
trainval/ErexJkoDhGI/50009 IT'LL GO ON AND PRODUCE A TADPOLE AND THEN A FROG
trainval/ErexJkoDhGI/50010 IN THOSE FOSSIL ROCKS ARE SOME AMAZING ANIMALS
trainval/ErexJkoDhGI/50011 WE FOUND MARSUPIAL LIONS
trainval/ErexJkoDhGI/50012 THAT WAS NOT WHAT HAPPENED ACTUALLY
trainval/ErexJkoDhGI/50013 AND THE KEY QUESTION FOR ME WAS TO ASK PETER HAS IT CHANGED
trainval/ErexJkoDhGI/50014 AND HE SAID NO
trainval/ErexJkoDhGI/50015 THE GRASSLANDS WERE SWEEPING AWAY
trainval/ErexJkoDhGI/50016 THE GENETICISTS LAUGHED
trainval/ErexJkoDhGI/50017 AND THAT WAS A WORRY
trainval/ErexJkoDhGI/50018 IT WAS NEARLY 80 YEARS BEFORE THIS THAT HE'D BEEN AT THIS HUT
trainval/ErexJkoDhGI/50019 AND HE TOLD ME AS IT ALL WAS FLOODING BACK IN MEMORIES
trainval/ErexJkoDhGI/50020 IS THAT ALL WE WOULD DO
trainval/ErexJkoDhGI/50021 WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THIS
trainval/Erm4vP1vTn8/50002 THEY DO OFFER A GOOD COST PERFORMANCE RATIO BUT THEY AREN'T REALLY FLEXIBLE IN TERMS OF THEIR DESIGN AND THIS MAKES
trainval/Erm4vP1vTn8/50003 THIS IS THE REASON WHY WE DON'T SEE MANY SOLAR CELLS ON BUILDINGS TODAY
trainval/Erm4vP1vTn8/50004 THEY JUST DON'T MATCH
trainval/Erm4vP1vTn8/50005 THESE TWO COMPOUNDS ARE MIXED AND DISSOLVED TO BECOME AN INK
trainval/Erm4vP1vTn8/50006 THE RESULTING THIN LAYER IS THE ACTIVE LAYER ABSORBING THE ENERGY OF THE SUN
trainval/Erm4vP1vTn8/50007 THAT'S A STABLE AND HEALTHY CONDITION
trainval/Erm4vP1vTn8/50008 TODAY'S SITUATION IS MORE LIKE MY OTHER SHOE
trainval/Erm4vP1vTn8/50009 IMAGINE THE SAILS OF THE SYDNEY OPERA AS POWER PLANTS
trainval/Erm4vP1vTn8/50010 THEY PROVIDED SHADING DURING THE DAY AND ELECTRICITY FOR THE LIGHTING IN THE EVENING
trainval/Erm4vP1vTn8/50011 YOU MAY WONDER WHY THIS HEXAGONAL SHAPE WAS CHOSEN FOR THE SOLAR CELLS
trainval/Erm4vP1vTn8/50012 I HOPE ORGANIC PHOTOVOLTAICS WILL BE A BIG PART OF THIS
trainval/eRQdAOrqvGg/50001 I HEARD A BAD NEWS STORY
trainval/eRQdAOrqvGg/50002 AS A MEDIA HISTORIAN I CAN SAY THAT
trainval/eRQdAOrqvGg/50003 BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE TRAIN MOVING MORE THAN 30 MILES AN HOUR
trainval/eRQdAOrqvGg/50004 AND NOW MANY OF US DEPEND ON THE TELEPHONE TO SUPPORT FAMILY LIFE
trainval/eRQdAOrqvGg/50005 WE WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT THE SALACIOUS NEWS HEADLINES AND NOT ENOUGH ABOUT WHAT
trainval/eRQdAOrqvGg/50006 BECAUSE THEIR TEXT WILL BE VERY BORING
trainval/eRQdAOrqvGg/50007 WHAT IT'S LIKE TO WATCH A SLUMBER PARTY THAT YOU WEREN'T INVITED TO UNFOLD
trainval/eRQdAOrqvGg/50008 WHAT'S THAT REALLY LIKE
trainval/eRQdAOrqvGg/50009 AND THE CHALLENGING PIECES
trainval/eRQdAOrqvGg/50010 BECAUSE IN ORDER TO RAISE KIDS WITH EMPATHY WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT THEIR DAY TO DAY LIVES
trainval/eRQdAOrqvGg/50011 AND SO WE NEED TO REALLY GET CURIOUS WHAT COULD THIS PERSON BE DOING
trainval/eRQdAOrqvGg/50013 THE MOST LIKELY THING IS THAT THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING ELSE
trainval/eRQdAOrqvGg/50014 THEY'RE SLEEPING THEY'RE DOING THEIR HOMEWORK THEY'RE EATING DINNER WITH THEIR PARENTS
trainval/eRQdAOrqvGg/50015 AND IT'S REALLY HELPFUL FOR THE KIDS
trainval/eRQdAOrqvGg/50016 EMPATHY IS THE APP
trainval/eRQdAOrqvGg/50017 MORE THAN THEY NEED US TO SPY ON THEM THEY NEED US TO HELP THEM FIGURE OUT WHAT DO WE DO WHEN THINGS GO WRONG IN A
trainval/eRQdAOrqvGg/50018 EVERY SINGLE KID THAT I HAVE MET THIS AGE WHO I'VE TALKED TO ABOUT WHAT PROBLEMS IN YOUR LIFE DOES
trainval/eRQdAOrqvGg/50019 THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE NOT NEEDED
trainval/eRQdAOrqvGg/50020 SO THEY DESIGNED AN APP
trainval/eRQdAOrqvGg/50021 SO WHAT IT DOES IS YOU TRAIN THE APP TO RECOGNIZE THE VOICE OF YOUR CHILDREN SO THAT RANDOM KIDS CAN'T
trainval/eRQdAOrqvGg/50022 YOU CAN SET IT ON A 3 MINUTE SETTING OR IF YOU FOND OF FIVE MORE MINUTES IN YOUR CHILDREN YOU CAN GET FIVE MORE MINUTES
trainval/eRQdAOrqvGg/50023 BUT THEY'RE TURNING THE TIMER BACK ON US
trainval/eRQdAOrqvGg/50024 WE HURT THEIR FEELINGS IN SOME WAY
trainval/eRQdAOrqvGg/50026 WE DON'T HAVE TO BE PLUGGED IN ALL THE TIME
trainval/eRQdAOrqvGg/50027 SO THIS SUGGESTS AGAIN THAT THEY REALLY DO NEED ADULT MENTORSHIP
trainval/eRQdAOrqvGg/50028 WE PROBABLY ALL NEED A LITTLE APP THAT GIVES A LITTLE THOUGHT BUBBLE
trainval/eRQdAOrqvGg/50029 ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO SEND THAT
trainval/ERSZb2wHFDw/50001 INSTEAD OF FIXATING ON SKILLS AND MOVING STUDENTS FROM ONE READING LEVEL TO ANOTHER
trainval/ERSZb2wHFDw/50002 IRBY I CAN'T READ
trainval/ERSZb2wHFDw/50003 ACCORDING TO THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION MORE THAN 85 PERCENT OF BLACK MALE FOURTH
trainval/ERSZb2wHFDw/50004 AND A MAJORITY OF BLACK BOYS ARE RAISED BY SINGLE MOTHERS
trainval/ERSZb2wHFDw/50005 BARBERSHOP BOOKS CONNECTS READING TO A MALE CENTERED SPACE AND INVOLVES BLACK MEN
trainval/ERSZb2wHFDw/50006 BLACK BOYS DESERVE AND DESPERATELY NEED MORE OF THAT
trainval/eS44GSkE8lE/50001 I GREW UP WATCHING STAR TREK
trainval/eS44GSkE8lE/50002 I THINK THIS IS A FASCINATING BEHAVIOR THAT SHOWS HOW FAST THE FLY'S BRAIN CAN PROCESS INFORMATION
trainval/eS44GSkE8lE/50003 I LOVE STAR TREK
trainval/eS44GSkE8lE/50004 AND THE BASIC PUNCHLINE OF MY TALK IS I'D LIKE TO TURN THAT OVER ON ITS HEAD
trainval/eS44GSkE8lE/50005 I DON'T THINK THEY'RE A SIMPLE MODEL OF ANYTHING
trainval/eS44GSkE8lE/50006 I USED TO STUDY MICE
trainval/eS44GSkE8lE/50007 WHEN I STUDIED MICE I USED TO TALK REALLY SLOWLY
trainval/eS44GSkE8lE/50008 I GREW UP IN BALTIMORE AND I CHEW CRABS VERY VERY WELL
trainval/eS44GSkE8lE/50009 SO I REALLY THINK THAT AS WE LEARN MORE IT'S GOING TO TURN OUT THAT THE WHOLE FLY BRAIN IS JUST LIKE A
trainval/eS44GSkE8lE/50010 IT'S A NON SPIKING CELL
trainval/es4w3WUcrN0/50001 WELL LET ME SHOW YOU
trainval/es4w3WUcrN0/50002 PLUS EVERY PHOTOGRAPH IS GEOTAGGED AND TIME STAMPED PROVIDING YOU WITH PROOF
trainval/es4w3WUcrN0/50003 HOW MIGHT THEY USE THIS DATA TO ALIGN THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS
trainval/es4w3WUcrN0/50004 SO I THOUGHT WHY NOT APPLY THAT CROWDSOURCED CLEANUP MODEL TO THE ENTIRE PLANET
trainval/eSBZigXlphY/50001 POLITICAL SCIENTIST VICTOR ASAL AND COLLEAGUES HAVE LOOKED AT SEVERAL FACTORS THAT SHAPE A POLITICAL GROUP'S
trainval/ESlb3D7AySM/50001 IN THE CASE OF GOOSEBERRY NATURAL RESOURCES THIS PATENT ON EMAILING NEWS RELEASES HAD SORT OF A FATAL FLAW
trainval/ESlb3D7AySM/50002 NEVER MIND THE FACT THAT THE ADDRESS LED TO A STRIP MALL SOMEWHERE IN NORTHERN L
trainval/ESlb3D7AySM/50003 WITH NO EMPLOYEES
trainval/ESlb3D7AySM/50004 WELL DURING THE SETTLEMENT PROCESS WHEN WE RECEIVED OUR COPY I STRUCK IT
trainval/ESlb3D7AySM/50005 NOW THE REASON THIS WORKS IS BECAUSE PATENT TROLLS ARE PAID A PERCENTAGE OF WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO RECOVER IN SETTLEMENTS
trainval/ESlb3D7AySM/50006 NOW THIS IS A TACTIC THAT PATENT TROLLS ARE SUPPOSED TO USE ON PEOPLE TO GET THEIR WAY
trainval/ESlb3D7AySM/50007 DON'T FORGET THAT
trainval/ESlb3D7AySM/50008 THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY WOULD LIKE STRONGER PROTECTIONS FOR INVENTORS
trainval/ESlb3D7AySM/50009 THE HI TECH INDUSTRY WOULD LIKE STRONGER PROTECTIONS FOR PRODUCERS
trainval/ESlb3D7AySM/50010 AND AS A RESULT THE PATENT TROLL CAN CLAIM THAT THEY WON THE CASE
trainval/ESNiCniw0JE/50001 INFECTION RATE STOOD AT ABOUT TWO PERCENT IN MY EARLY DAYS THERE
trainval/ESNiCniw0JE/50002 THESE WOULD SOAR TO ONE OUT OF EVERY FOUR ADULTS BY THE TIME I
trainval/ESNiCniw0JE/50003 I WAS PROVIDING EXCELLENT TREATMENT SUCH AS IT WAS
trainval/ESNiCniw0JE/50004 IN 1994 HE WAS HEAD OF THE UN PEACEKEEPING DEPARTMENT
trainval/ESNiCniw0JE/50005 A MASSIVE EXPANSION OF RURAL HEALTH CENTERS PLACED ROUGHLY 80 PERCENT OF THE
trainval/ESNiCniw0JE/50006 WHITES WERE LARGELY UNSCATHED
trainval/ESNiCniw0JE/50007 WORKING SIDE BY SIDE WITH BRILLIANT ZIMBABWEANS SCIENTISTS DOCTORS ACTIVISTS
trainval/ESNiCniw0JE/50008 BUT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT ENDURING AND DISPARATE RATES AND THE
trainval/ESNiCniw0JE/50009 YOU'VE PROBABLY FELT SOMETHING EVERY TIME I'VE SAID IT
trainval/ESNiCniw0JE/50010 THAT'S WHY SOUNDING THE ALARM ABOUT THE IMPACT OF RACISM ON HEALTH IN THE
trainval/ESPCyHjmRsQ/50001 BUT THERE'D BE NO WAY TO ACTUALLY ADD THOSE SOUNDS IN THE MIDDLE OF A PERFORMANCE
trainval/ESPCyHjmRsQ/50002 SO THE WAY THAT THIS WORKS IS THE KINNECT IS USING INFRA RED TO SEE EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING IN FRONT OF IT
trainval/ESPCyHjmRsQ/50003 AND WHILE I'VE BEEN IMPROVISING AND PLAYING I THINK TO MYSELF
trainval/esPRsTSlmw8/50001 OVER THE NEXT 22 YEARS MY COLLEAGUES AND I WOULD BUILD THE WORLD'S LARGEST
trainval/esPRsTSlmw8/50002 SPECT BASICALLY TELLS US THREE THINGS ABOUT THE BRAIN
trainval/esPRsTSlmw8/50003 IMAGING WAS SHOWING US THERE WAS A BETTER WAY
trainval/esPRsTSlmw8/50004 WHEN I MET HIM AT THE AGE OF 15 HE HAD JUST BEEN KICKED OUT OF HIS THIRD
trainval/esPRsTSlmw8/50005 WHAT IF WE EVALUATED AND TREATED TROUBLED BRAINS RATHER THAN SIMPLY WAREHOUSING THEM IN
trainval/esPRsTSlmw8/50006 AND WHEN YOU DO YOU CHANGE THEIR LIFE
trainval/esPRsTSlmw8/50007 THAT WAS NOT A SURPRISE
trainval/esPRsTSlmw8/50008 PROBABLY A BAD IDEA FOR YOUR LIFE
trainval/esPRsTSlmw8/50009 TODAY WE HAVE SCANNED OVER 500 CONVICTED FELONS INCLUDING 90 MURDERERS
trainval/esPRsTSlmw8/50010 THAT WAS NOT A SURPRISE
trainval/esugL07XANg/50001 I'M STEVE KLASKO
trainval/esugL07XANg/50002 WELL AMAZINGLY THE DOCS SAID NO
trainval/esugL07XANg/50003 AND THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN
trainval/esugL07XANg/50004 SO THAT BRINGS US TO 2014 AND WHY WAS 2014 IMPORTANT TO ME
trainval/esugL07XANg/50005 THIS TIME THOUGH THE INSURERS AND GOVERNMENT SAID
trainval/esugL07XANg/50006 IT WAS AN ADIDAS MARKETING CAMPAIGN BACK IN 2014 CALLED THE IMPOSSIBLE
trainval/esugL07XANg/50008 SO HOW DID WE GET THERE
trainval/esugL07XANg/50009 I'D LIKE TO
trainval/esugL07XANg/50010 AND NOW WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE CAN TAKE THINGS FROM OTHER INDUSTRIES
trainval/esugL07XANg/50011 SO AT JEFFERSON FOR EXAMPLE IN 2014 WE STARTED THE CENTER FOR HEALTHCARE ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SCIENTIFIC SOLUTIONS
trainval/esugL07XANg/50012 SO WE TOOK SOME OF THE BEST PEOPLE DOING MATHEMATICAL MODELING AND CREATED A PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS AND MATHEMATICAL MODELING
trainval/esugL07XANg/50013 NOT ONLY THAT WE'VE CHANGED THE WAY WE DO THINGS
trainval/esugL07XANg/50014 SO THE BIG TIP TELEVISION SHOW IN THE 70S WAS MARCUS WELBY
trainval/esugL07XANg/50015 NOW HERE'S WHAT MARCUS WELBY WAS
trainval/esugL07XANg/50017 NOW WE SPEND MOST OF OUR TIME IN WHAT WE CALL THE ART OF ATTENDING
trainval/esugL07XANg/50018 WE MEASURE INDIVIDUALS' PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL HAPPINESS AT VARYING INTERVALS AFTER GRADUATION
trainval/esugL07XANg/50019 BECAUSE AFTER ALL THAT'S WHY THEY CAME TO OUR UNIVERSITY
trainval/esugL07XANg/50020 WHAT DID THAT DO FOR US OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS
trainval/esugL07XANg/50021 FOR THOSE OF YOU FROM THE 2010S IT'S SORT OF LIKE A RED BOX FOR YOUR DNA
trainval/ESwp7HN9Zvs/50001 THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT CONTINUE TO JUDGE US AND WANT US TO BE SILENCED
trainval/ESwp7HN9Zvs/50002 BUT WE ARE THE LUCKY ONES
trainval/ESwp7HN9Zvs/50005 50 OF US LEAVE WITH A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE AND WE'RE 20 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE BY THE TIME WE GET
trainval/ESwp7HN9Zvs/50006 THESE ARE YOUR CHILDREN AND THEY'RE CRYING OUT FOR YOUR HELP
trainval/ESwp7HN9Zvs/50007 IT WASN'T OUR FAULT
trainval/ESwp7HN9Zvs/50008 I SAW IT LAST YEAR WHEN I WAS IN A CHURCH HALL SURROUNDED BY 300 PEOPLE PROTESTING THE BUILD OF A
trainval/ESwp7HN9Zvs/50010 THIS IS WHAT THOSE PEOPLE HAD TO SAY
trainval/ESwp7HN9Zvs/50012 AND I FELL APART IN THAT WOMAN'S ARMS AND SHE CUDDLED ME IN LIKE I WAS HER OWN CHILD
trainval/ESwp7HN9Zvs/50013 BUT I KNOW NOW WENDY WAS AN EMPLOYEE SHE WAS A WORKER
trainval/ESwp7HN9Zvs/50014 SHE WASN'T ALLOWED TO TELL ME THAT SHE LOVED ME
trainval/ESwp7HN9Zvs/50015 SO MUCH SO THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO BE HERE ANYMORE
trainval/ESwp7HN9Zvs/50016 TEN ISN'T EVEN A BIG NUMBER
trainval/ESwp7HN9Zvs/50017 BUT I'LL NEVER FORGET THE NEIGHBOUR THAT USED TO COME AND CHECK ON ME
trainval/ESwp7HN9Zvs/50018 AND THE NEIGHBOUR THAT GOT ME HELP WHEN I NEEDED IT
trainval/ESwp7HN9Zvs/50019 I'LL TELL YOU
trainval/ESwp7HN9Zvs/50020 AND I WAS ANGRY
trainval/ESwp7HN9Zvs/50021 DO YOU THINK THE SUFFRAGETTES LET FEAR WIN WHEN THEY WERE CAMPAIGNING FOR THE WOMAN'S RIGHT TO VOTE
trainval/ESwp7HN9Zvs/50022 THAT'S ALL WE WANT AN EQUAL CHANCE AT LIFE
trainval/EszGIvRdgTE/50001 NOW I'M GOING TO TRY A TRICK AND RECREATE AN EXPERIMENT FROM THIS MORNING
trainval/EszGIvRdgTE/50002 I THINK THIS IS WHAT DAVID DEUTSCH MEANT IN 2005 WHEN HE ENDED HIS OXFORD TEDTALK
trainval/EszGIvRdgTE/50003 THE SECOND IS THAT PROBLEMS ARE SOLUBLE
trainval/EszGIvRdgTE/50004 SO IF THAT'S RIGHT WHY DID WE ONLY CAPTURE FOUR OUT OF THOSE 151 MINDS
trainval/et3SeEX62aU/50001 FOR SOME CONTEXT WE PASSED THE ORBIT OF THE MOON IN LESS THAN NINE HOURS
trainval/et3SeEX62aU/50002 5 YEARS TO GET THERE
trainval/ETFkztcoMVc/50001 ONCE WE ACCEPT THIS REALITY WE'LL REALIZE HOW CRUCIAL IT IS THAT WE CONTINUE TO EXPLORE WAYS
trainval/Eu22Wgu98VE/50002 I WOULD SEE MEN
trainval/Eu22Wgu98VE/50003 THEY LOOKED LIKE MY DAD
trainval/Eu22Wgu98VE/50004 BLIND LEADING THE BLIND
trainval/Eu22Wgu98VE/50005 WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW IS TO PAY ATTENTION
trainval/Eu22Wgu98VE/50006 I SEE THAT HABIT
trainval/EUYLa7MAlPc/50001 SO WE'VE MADE THIS COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT
trainval/EUYLa7MAlPc/50002 BECAUSE I HAVE A DREAM OF A HEALED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ONE IN WHICH WE BRING THE BEST OF
trainval/EUYLa7MAlPc/50003 THIS SOUL MEDICINE' I THINK IS SO MUCH OF WHAT WE'VE LOST IN MODERN MEDICINE TODAY
trainval/EUYLa7MAlPc/50004 WE ALL KNOW IT
trainval/EUYLa7MAlPc/50005 BUT TO THE BODY STRESS IS VERY DIFFERENT
trainval/EUYLa7MAlPc/50006 MY HUSBAND CUT TWO FINGERS OFF HIS LEFT HAND WITH A TABLE SAW
trainval/EUYLa7MAlPc/50007 YEAH SO THANK GOD FOR DR
trainval/EUYLa7MAlPc/50008 JONES WHO SPENT EIGHT HOURS IN SURGERY WITH A MICROSCOPE PUTTING THOSE FINGERS BACK ON SO THAT MY HUSBAND HAS TEN FINGERS TODAY
trainval/EUYLa7MAlPc/50009 AND THIS IS POSSIBLE FOR YOU
trainval/eUznJ3LtvGc/50002 THE ASTEROIDS ARE RICH IN MATERIALS THAT WE WANT
trainval/evfgbVjb688/50001 YOU KNOW FROM AN OCEANIC PERSPECTIVE 450 IS WAY TOO HIGH
trainval/evfgbVjb688/50002 BUT THE FACT IS WE DO KNOW A LOT ABOUT ALL OF THOSE THINGS
trainval/EwuunRJgoBw/50001 MY NAME IS CARMEN JONES
trainval/EwuunRJgoBw/50002 I AM A LEADER WITH AN IMPECCABLE DRIVE
trainval/EwuunRJgoBw/50003 I AM A DIAMOND FACETED WITH MANY CUTS
trainval/EwuunRJgoBw/50004 I AM BEAUTIFUL
trainval/EwuunRJgoBw/50005 I USED TO SAY TO MYSELF YOU AIN'T SHIT
trainval/ExcDNly1DbI/50001 THAT'S VERY UNUSUAL
trainval/ExcDNly1DbI/50002 I HAVEN'T SAID A THING TO YOU THAT MADE YOU THINK
trainval/exjlR7izakg/50001 MAYBE IN THE ANIMALS MAYBE IN THE HUMANS SOMEWHERE YOU WILL BE REBORN
trainval/exjlR7izakg/50002 THAT IS THE MAIN POINT
trainval/exjlR7izakg/50003 KARMIC DREAM IS ALWAYS IT IS THE NEGATIVE SIDE
trainval/exjlR7izakg/50004 THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU
trainval/EXo3qA9V3eI/50001 AND TODAY WE HOPE TO CONVINCE YOU THAT NOW WE ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO ACTIVATE A MEMORY IN THE BRAIN
trainval/EXo3qA9V3eI/50002 FIRST YOU FIND AND LABEL A MEMORY IN THE BRAIN AND THEN YOU ACTIVATE IT WITH A
trainval/EXo3qA9V3eI/50003 IT TURNED OUT THAT ALL WE NEED TO DO IS BASICALLY TO LET THE BRAIN FORM A MEMORY AND THEN THE BRAIN WILL
trainval/EXo3qA9V3eI/50004 SO WHAT IF WE COULD START OFF BY GOING INTO THE BRAIN AND JUST FINDING A SINGLE MEMORY TO BEGIN WITH
trainval/EXo3qA9V3eI/50005 DO I SAY HI
trainval/EXo3qA9V3eI/50006 DO I SHAKE THEIR HAND
trainval/EXo3qA9V3eI/50007 EVER SINCE THE PUBLICATION OF OUR WORK WE'VE BEEN RECEIVING NUMEROUS COMMENTS FROM ALL OVER THE
trainval/EXo3qA9V3eI/50008 MAYBE WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE
trainval/EXo3qA9V3eI/50009 SO FAR WHAT WE'VE TOLD YOU IS BASICALLY WE CAN CONTROL THIS PLAY BUTTON OF THE CLIP SO THAT WE CAN PLAY THIS VIDEO
trainval/eXp5QSfXLQU/50001 SO IN SUMMER 2000 I WAS THE FIRST TO BASE JUMP THE EIGER NORTH FACE IN SWITZERLAND
trainval/eXp5QSfXLQU/50002 THAT'S REASON NUMBER ONE
trainval/eXp5QSfXLQU/50003 UE USUALLY I'M WEARING A HELMET
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50001 I WOULD PROPOSE TO YOU NOT ONLY IS YOUR MIND AND BODY ONE BUT YOU ARE ONE WITH THE UNIVERSE
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50002 THE EXPERTS SAY ABOUT 30 DAYS
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50003 HOW ABOUT THIS
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50004 READY FOR THIS ONE
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50005 SO WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50006 WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS USE SOME EXAMPLES TODAY FROM THE MARTIAL ART OF KI AIKIDO TO GIVE YOU AN
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50007 I'LL GIVE YOU AN IMAGE TO MAKE THAT MORE CLEAR
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50008 I HAD THAT EXPERIENCE
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50009 THAT IS MY GOAL TODAY BUT WHAT I WILL DO IS TRY TO GIVE YOU SOME TOOLS
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50010 ANYWAY THAT'S MY GOAL
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50012 STUCKNESS IS HARD WIRED IN US
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50013 I CAN MAKE THE POINT VERY SIMPLY BY TALKING ABOUT YOUR DAILY LIFE EXPERIENCE
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50014 AND ONE OF THOSE ADDICTIONS IS THE HABIT OF SEPARATING YOUR MIND AND BODY TOGETHER
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50015 THAT'S THE PROBLEM
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50017 SOMETHING ABOUT THIS DESERVES SOME ATTENTION HERE
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50018 EVEN THOUGH WE TEND TO BE IN THE HABIT OF SEPARATING OUR MIND AND BODY I CAN SHARE WITH YOU A
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50019 YOU JUST DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO IT
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50020 I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50021 HOW MANY OF YOU ARE THINKING RIGHT NOW ABOUT YOUR HEART BEATING
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50022 HOW ABOUT THIS
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50023 BY THE WAY IT IS THE SAME FOR ALL OF US
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50024 I AM GOING TO TRY AND RESIST WITH MY BODY
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50025 OK WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50026 YOU KNOW WHY
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50027 I'M GOING TO ASK DEREK TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL CENTER OF HIS BODY
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50028 THAT IS WHAT DEREK DID WHEN HE WALKED RIGHT INTO MY HAND
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50029 SO GUESS WHAT YOU NOW KNOW THOSE CONDITIONS WHERE YOU'RE NOT OPERATING TO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50030 DO YOU KNOW WHY
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50031 AT HOME SHOULDN'T WE BE THE BEST WE CAN BE WITH OUR LOVED ONES
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50032 KEEP ONE POINT
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50033 AND YOUR WHOLE WORLD CHANGES
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50034 HOW MANY PEOPLE DOES IT TAKE TO HAVE AN ARGUMENT
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50035 HOW ABOUT THIS IN ATHLETICS
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50036 HOLD OUT YOUR HAND AS TIGHT AS YOU CAN
trainval/eyBEIx7fCfY/50037 JUST STICK IT OUT LIKE THAT
trainval/eYLb7WUtYt8/50001 WHY BOTHER TELL ME
trainval/eyq2Wo4eUDg/50001 I SAID CERTAIN NEUROTRANSMITTERS GO UP CERTAIN ONES GO DOWN
trainval/eyq2Wo4eUDg/50002 I SAID SOME MAY HAVE A TIPPING POINT REACTION
trainval/eyq2Wo4eUDg/50003 THAT'S WHY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS
trainval/eyq2Wo4eUDg/50004 HE FALLS IN LOVE AND A RESEARCHER WALKS UP SAYING CONGRATULATIONS
trainval/eyq2Wo4eUDg/50005 NOW WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
trainval/eyq2Wo4eUDg/50006 AND HOW DO YOU GET THE RECEPTORS
trainval/eyq2Wo4eUDg/50007 THEY TESTED THEIR TESTOSTERONE
trainval/eyq2Wo4eUDg/50008 THIS IS WHAT THEY DISCOVERED
trainval/eyq2Wo4eUDg/50009 AND HERE'S THE CATCH
trainval/eyq2Wo4eUDg/50010 REMEMBER WHAT SHE SAID
trainval/EZ9tC3PigiU/50001 SO I'VE BEEN TALKING COURSES
trainval/eZgSGgToBEE/50001 SO IT'S A STARTING POINT
trainval/EZSf3Fc0ZRA/50001 WE NEED TO REARRANGE THE PATTERN
trainval/EZSf3Fc0ZRA/50002 WE CAN NOW ACTUALLY INTERFERE WITH THEIR PSYCHOLOGY IN RATHER PROFOUND WAYS AS I'LL SHOW YOU IN MY LAST
trainval/EZSf3Fc0ZRA/50004 WE HAVE CREATED SUCH A SITUATION ARTIFICIALLY
trainval/ezVk1ahRF78/50001 THIS IS A QUIZ
trainval/ezVk1ahRF78/50002 AND THEREFORE I WILL LIMIT MYSELF TO ONLY TALK ABOUT THE LINKS BETWEEN RELIGION AND SEXUALITY
trainval/ezVk1ahRF78/50003 WE GET THAT FROM THE CENSUS DATA
trainval/ezVk1ahRF78/50004 BECAUSE THE DEATH OF A CHILD IS COMPENSATED BY ONE MORE CHILD
trainval/ezVk1ahRF78/50006 I COULDN'T AGREE MORE
trainval/EZwxKPv1CwA/50001 BUT ACTUALLY IT'S MY BELIEF THAT THE PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN TRULY CAPITALIZING ON THIS AGE OF BEHAVIOR UP UNTIL NOW UP UNTIL
trainval/EZwxKPv1CwA/50002 AND I WAS ACTUALLY A POTENT FORCE IN SPREADING IDEAS ACROSS BORDERS AND I WITNESSED THE RISE OF ISLAMIST
trainval/EZwxKPv1CwA/50004 AT THE AGE OF 19 I WAS ON THE NATIONAL LEADERSHIP OF THIS ORGANIZATION IN THE U
trainval/EZwxKPv1CwA/50005 WE FELT THAT THEY WERE OUT OF DATE
trainval/EZwxKPv1CwA/50006 OR HOW COULD WE HAVE BETTER PREPARED FOR THAT
trainval/EZwxKPv1CwA/50007 THEY'RE TRANSNATIONAL AND THEY BOND AROUND THESE IDEAS AND NARRATIVES AND THESE SYMBOLS AND THESE LEADERS
trainval/EZwxKPv1CwA/50008 AND THEN YOU HAVE A THIRD PARTY SAYING VOTE FOR US WE'LL ESTABLISH A THEOCRACY
trainval/EZwxKPv1CwA/50009 SO DEMOCRACY HAS BECOME MERELY ONE POLITICAL CHOICE AMONG MANY OTHER FORMS OF POLITICAL CHOICES
trainval/EZwxKPv1CwA/50010 AND THEN PEOPLE SAY WE'VE TRIED DEMOCRACY
trainval/EZwxKPv1CwA/50011 IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK
trainval/EZwxKPv1CwA/50012 LET'S BRING THE MILITARY BACK AGAIN
trainval/EZwxKPv1CwA/50013 IF I ASKED YOU TO THINK OF THE IDEAS OF AL QAEDA THAT'S SOMETHING THAT COMES TO YOUR MIND IMMEDIATELY
trainval/EZwxKPv1CwA/50014 IF I ASK YOU TO THINK OF THEIR NARRATIVES THE WEST BEING AT WAR WITH ISLAM THE NEED TO DEFEND ISLAM AGAINST THE WEST THESE
trainval/EZwxKPv1CwA/50015 WHEREAS IF WE START BUILDING THIS DEMAND ON THE GROUND ON A CIVILIZATIONAL LEVEL RATHER THAN MERELY ON A POLITICAL LEVEL A LEVEL
trainval/EZwxKPv1CwA/50016 SO THE IDEAS AND THE NARRATIVES OF AL QAEDA COME TO YOUR MIND IMMEDIATELY
trainval/EZwxKPv1CwA/50017 BUT GENERALLY THE TRENDS THAT START IN EGYPT HAVE HISTORICALLY SPREAD ACROSS THE MENA REGION THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA REGION
trainval/EZwxKPv1CwA/50018 AND IT'S WITH THAT THOUGHT THAT I'LL END
trainval/EZwxKPv1CwA/50019 WE NEED TO MOVE ONE STEP BEYOND THAT NOW
trainval/eZWzNfOpbCQ/50001 THERE ARE SO MANY REASONS
trainval/eZWzNfOpbCQ/50002 BUT DON'T JUST TAKE MY WORD FOR IT
trainval/eZWzNfOpbCQ/50003 BUT I'M NOT GOING TO SHOW YOU ANY GRAPHIC IMAGES OR
trainval/eZWzNfOpbCQ/50004 ANOTHER REASON HAS TO DO WITH A COPING PROCESS THAT PSYCHOLOGISTS CALL PSYCHIC NUMBING
trainval/eZWzNfOpbCQ/50005 THIS IS WHAT A SLAUGHTERHOUSE WORKER SAYS I DON'T THINK OF FARMED ANIMALS AS
trainval/F0ofeD8VKMA/50001 CA WE'LL COME BACK TO THE MAMMOTHS BUT EXPLAIN HOW WE SHOULD THINK OF EXTINCTIONS
trainval/F0ofeD8VKMA/50002 THERE'S BEARS COMING BACK
trainval/F0ofeD8VKMA/50003 THERE'S LYNX COMING BACK
trainval/F0ofeD8VKMA/50004 THERE'S THE EUROPEAN JACKAL
trainval/F0ofeD8VKMA/50005 AND ASIAN ELEPHANTS THEY DON'T LIKE SNOW RIGHT
trainval/F0ofeD8VKMA/50006 WELL IT TURNS OUT THEY DO LIKE SNOW
trainval/F0ofeD8VKMA/50007 THAT'S HALFWAY THROUGH ITS GESTATION PERIOD
trainval/F0ofeD8VKMA/50008 THERE'S JUST A FEW ANIMALS THERE
trainval/F0ofeD8VKMA/50009 IT'S LIKE MEDICINE
trainval/F0ofeD8VKMA/50010 AND YOU'VE PROBABLY FINISHED THE BOOK
trainval/F0ofeD8VKMA/50012 AND THE OPTIMIST IN ME IS TRYING HARD TO LEAN TOWARDS THIS IS AWESOME AND REALLY EXCITING
trainval/F0ofeD8VKMA/50013 SCIENCE IS ORGANIZED SKEPTICISM
trainval/F0ofeD8VKMA/50014 SO THIS WHAT ELSE IS GOING
trainval/F0ofeD8VKMA/50015 ARE THERE SMALL SCALE EXPERIMENTS OR SYSTEMS WE CAN NUDGE AND PLAY WITH
trainval/F0ofeD8VKMA/50016 HOW ON EARTH DO WE THINK ABOUT IT
trainval/F0ofeD8VKMA/50017 WE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE CLIMATE SYSTEM WORKS
trainval/F0ofeD8VKMA/50018 YOU WROTE WE ARE AS GODS AND MIGHT AS WELL GET USED TO IT
trainval/F17SKiAZOxg/50001 NOT AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED
trainval/F17SKiAZOxg/50002 BECAUSE THESE THINGS DON'T EVOLVE BY THEMSELVES
trainval/F17SKiAZOxg/50004 BECAUSE IF WE CAN MAYBE WE HAVE A CHANCE OF ACTUALLY DISCOVERING LIFE SOMEWHERE ELSE WITHOUT BEING
trainval/F17SKiAZOxg/50005 AND SO NOW WE CAN SEE IS THAT REALLY A ROBUST SIGNATURE
trainval/F1U26PLiXjM/50001 I'D STUDIED THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF PHYSICS BIOLOGY CHEMISTRY BUT NOT ONE HOUR NOT ONE CONCEPT
trainval/F1U26PLiXjM/50002 THAT'S WHY YOUR SCHEMAS HAD BETTER MATCH REALITY
trainval/F1U26PLiXjM/50003 THAT'S THE BEAUTIFUL THING ABOUT SCIENCE
trainval/F2dFiK3wkRA/50001 I THOUGHT I COULD GET AWAY WITH NOT PAYING SOME TAXES
trainval/F2dFiK3wkRA/50002 AND ENDED UP A NIGHT IN PRISON
trainval/F2dFiK3wkRA/50003 BUT THAT'S ANOTHER SUBJECT
trainval/F2dFiK3wkRA/50005 JUST ONE THING LED ON TO ANOTHER
trainval/F2dFiK3wkRA/50007 AND WE'VE SPENT TWO YEARS LOOKING AT THE WAR ON DRUGS
trainval/F2dFiK3wkRA/50008 IF SOMEBODY SMOKES TOO MANY CIGARETTES WE DO OUR BEST TO TRY AND HELP THEM STOP SMOKING TOO MANY
trainval/F2dFiK3wkRA/50009 I HAVE 3 CHILDREN
trainval/F2dFiK3wkRA/50010 I'VE BEEN IN PRISON FOR 19 YEARS NOW
trainval/F2dFiK3wkRA/50012 AND I THINK WITH MR
trainval/F2dFiK3wkRA/50013 BRANSON'S IDEA AND HIS HELP I THINK WE CAN REALLY KIND OF PUSH THE SYSTEM TO MOVE THIS QUICKER
trainval/F2hc2FLOdhI/50001 I RECENTLY WAS AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE AND THEIR FIVE YEAR OLD WAS GETTING READY FOR BED
trainval/F2hc2FLOdhI/50002 HE WAS STANDING ON A STOOL BY THE SINK BRUSHING HIS TEETH WHEN HE SLIPPED AND SCRATCHED HIS
trainval/F2hc2FLOdhI/50003 HE CRIED FOR A MINUTE BUT THEN HE GOT BACK UP GOT BACK ON THE STOOL AND REACHED OUT FOR A BOX OF
trainval/F2hc2FLOdhI/50004 JUST SHAKE IT OFF IT'S ALL IN YOUR HEAD
trainval/F2hc2FLOdhI/50005 I WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING
trainval/F2hc2FLOdhI/50006 I WAS IN THE GRIPS OF REAL LONELINESS BACK THEN BUT I WAS SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE ALL DAY SO IT
trainval/F2hc2FLOdhI/50007 NOW ADULTS GET TRICKED THIS WAY AS WELL ALL THE TIME
trainval/F2hc2FLOdhI/50008 HE HAD VISIBLE TUMORS ALL OVER HIS BODY
trainval/F2hc2FLOdhI/50009 AND SO EACH TIME I HAD A WORRYING UPSETTING NEGATIVE THOUGHT I FORCED MYSELF TO CONCENTRATE ON
trainval/F2SIP2nSEoc/50001 RIGHT NOW WE FOCUS ON TOP DOWN
trainval/F2SIP2nSEoc/50002 COULD WE COLLABORATE WITH WOMEN JOURNALISTS WITHOUT CHAINS AND NOT GET CO OPTED INTO
trainval/F2SIP2nSEoc/50003 WE DID CAPACITY BUILDING
trainval/f4DV2BFUmSA/50001 7 AND HE WROTE 12 OF THEM IN TOTAL
trainval/F4RMDoGCCK0/50001 I NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE TRICORDER
trainval/F4Zu5ZZAG7I/50001 THE GROCERY GUY THE CAB GUY MAYBE THE RECEPTIONIST AT A NEW OFFICE YOU WENT TO
trainval/F4Zu5ZZAG7I/50003 I THINK I'VE HEARD THAT SOMEWHERE
trainval/F4Zu5ZZAG7I/50004 A CONVERSATION IS AN ADVENTURE
trainval/F4Zu5ZZAG7I/50005 AND I LOOK AT HER AND I SAY WOW
trainval/F4Zu5ZZAG7I/50007 WHAT DID YOU THINK OF IT
trainval/F5FYYV59Eew/50001 AND BY ADMISSION THEY ARE ALSO THE ONES THAT OFTEN FALL FLAT ON THEIR FACE AND FAIL
trainval/F5FYYV59Eew/50003 WHAT IS IT YOU WANT TO GO AND ACHIEVE
trainval/f5q9ZJ62NOo/50001 SOMEONE SPENT A COUNTLESS NUMBER OF HOURS SLAMMING DOWN ON THE KEYBOARD TYPING ALL THAT CODE THAT MAKES YOUR
trainval/f5udS4pbXPk/50001 JUSTICE WILL GO ASTRAY
trainval/f5udS4pbXPk/50002 HE WAS ALMOST AS HARD ON WESTERN GOVERNMENTS AND AUTHORS FOR THEIR SLOVENLY AND JARGON
trainval/f5udS4pbXPk/50003 ORWELL WENT ON
trainval/f5udS4pbXPk/50004 A MAN MAY TAKE TO DRINK BECAUSE HE FEELS HIMSELF TO BE A FAILURE AND THEN FAIL ALL THE MORE COMPLETELY
trainval/f5udS4pbXPk/50005 IT IS RATHER THE SAME THING THAT'S HAPPENING TO THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
trainval/f5udS4pbXPk/50006 IT BECOMES UGLY AND INACCURATE BECAUSE OUR THOUGHTS ARE FOOLISH BUT THE SLOVENLINESS OF OUR LANGUAGE
trainval/f5udS4pbXPk/50007 EVEN OUR DEAR MONARCH HAS TO ENDURE THIS WHEN SHE READS OUT THE QUEEN'S SPEECH AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH SESSION OF
trainval/f5udS4pbXPk/50008 THEY RESORT THEREFORE TO CAREFULLY PREPARED AND HIGHLY SPUN ONE LINERS OR TO STACCATO
trainval/f5udS4pbXPk/50009 I AM NOT A PESSIMIST THOUGH THAT'S HOW I MAY SOUND TO SOME OF YOU TODAY
trainval/f5udS4pbXPk/50010 GEORGE ORWELL WASN'T A PESSIMIST EITHER BACK IN 1946
trainval/f5udS4pbXPk/50011 ORWELL ROUNDED OFF HIS CLASSIC ESSAY WITH SIX RULES WHICH IF I HAD MY WAY WOULD BE
trainval/f5udS4pbXPk/50012 THE BEST YOU CAN HOPE FOR FROM THEM THESE DAYS ARE WHAT ARE KNOWN IN THE TRADE AS WELL REHEARSED
trainval/f5udS4pbXPk/50013 NEVER USE THE PASSIVE WHERE YOU CAN USE THE ACTIVE
trainval/f5udS4pbXPk/50014 NEVER USE A FOREIGN PHRASE A SCIENTIFIC WORD OR A JARGON WORD IF YOU CAN THINK OF AN EVERYDAY
trainval/f5udS4pbXPk/50015 AND FINALLY A SIXTH RULE WHICH IS VERY VERY ORWELL
trainval/F5yvoSu2OV0/50001 BECAUSE FOR ME IT TOOK A LOT FOR ME TO STAND HERE AND SAY I AM WORTH SOMETHING
trainval/F5yvoSu2OV0/50002 I AM VALUED
trainval/F5yvoSu2OV0/50003 BECAUSE SOCIETY HAS LABELED ME NOT ONLY UNHEALTHY BUT UNFIT
trainval/F5yvoSu2OV0/50004 WHEN YOU ACT YOU START TO BEHAVE IT AND MIMIC THOSE THINGS THAT YOU FEED INTO AND WHAT
trainval/F5yvoSu2OV0/50005 WHEN YOU START TO THINK POSITIVE OPPORTUNITIES OPEN AND DOORS OPEN
trainval/F5yvoSu2OV0/50006 NOT ONLY ARE YOU POSITIVE THINKING BUT YOU'RE ALSO GIVING TIME TO SELF LOVE YOURSELF
trainval/F5yvoSu2OV0/50007 I'M GOING TO BE YOU SAVIOR TODAY
trainval/F5yvoSu2OV0/50008 WHAT IS YOUR VALUE
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50001 ONE OF THE REASONS THE DOCTORS GAVE FOR HOSPITALIZING ME AGAINST MY WILL WAS THAT I WAS GRAVELY DISABLED
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50002 I NEVER STRUCK ANYONE
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50003 I NEVER HARMED ANYONE
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50004 STEVE BOTH A LAWYER AND A PSYCHOLOGIST HAS TREATED MANY PATIENTS WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS AND TO THIS DAY HE'LL SAY
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50005 HI' I SAID AND THEN I RETURNED TO THE COUCH WHERE I SAT IN SILENCE FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50006 TELL THE CLOCKS TO STOP
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50007 TIME HAS COME
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50009 I'M BEING PUSHED INTO A GRAVE
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50010 THE SITUATION IS GRAVE' I MOAN
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50011 GRAVITY IS PULLING ME DOWN
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50012 THAT IS AT BEST I WAS EXPECTED TO LIVE IN A BOARD AND CARE AND WORK AT MENIAL JOBS
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50013 FORTUNATELY I DID NOT ACTUALLY ENACT THAT GRAVE PROGNOSIS
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50014 DELUSIONS ARE FIXED AND FALSE BELIEFS THAT AREN'T RESPONSIVE TO EVIDENCE AND HALLUCINATIONS ARE FALSE SENSORY
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50015 OCCASIONALLY I HAVE HALLUCINATIONS LIKE ONE TIME I TURNED AROUND AND SAW A MAN WITH A RAISED KNIFE
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50016 OFTEN SPEECH AND THINKING BECOME DISORGANIZED TO THE POINT OF INCOHERENCE
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50017 BUT SCHIZOPHRENIA PRESENTS ITSELF ACROSS A WIDE ARRAY OF SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WITH THE ILLNESS WHO
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50018 SEVERAL YEARS AGO I DECIDED TO WRITE DOWN MY EXPERIENCES AND MY PERSONAL JOURNEY AND I WANT TO SHARE SOME MORE OF THAT
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50019 SO THE FOLLOWING EPISODE HAPPENED THE SEVENTH WEEK OF MY FIRST SEMESTER OF MY FIRST YEAR AT YALE LAW SCHOOL
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50020 AFTER I GRADUATED FROM THE YALE LAW SCHOOL AND GOT MY FIRST LAW JOB MY NEW HAVEN ANALYST DR
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50021 THEY MAKE CERTAIN POINTS
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50022 THE POINT IS ON YOUR HEAD
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50023 OH YOU KNOW THE USUAL
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50024 WHO'S WHAT WHAT'S WHO HEAVEN AND HELL
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50025 LET'S GO OUT ON THE ROOF
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50026 THIS IS THE REAL ME' I ANNOUNCED WAVING MY ARMS ABOVE MY HEAD
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50027 ARE YOU ON DRUGS
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50029 NO WAY NO DRUGS
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50030 YOU'RE FRIGHTENING ME' ONE OF THEM SAID AND REBEL AND VAL HEADED BACK INTO THE LIBRARY
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50031 EVENTUALLY I MADE MY WAY BACK TO MY DORM ROOM AND ONCE THERE I COULDN'T SETTLE DOWN
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50032 MY HEAD WAS TOO FULL OF NOISE TOO FULL OF ORANGE TREES AND LAW MEMOS I COULD NOT WRITE AND MASS MURDERS
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50033 ONCE THERE SOMEONE I'LL JUST CALL THE DOCTOR' AND HIS WHOLE TEAM OF GOONS SWOOPED DOWN LIFTED ME HIGH
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50034 A SOUND CAME OUT OF MY MOUTH THAT I'D NEVER HEARD BEFORE HALF GROAN HALF SCREAM
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50035 IT'S BEEN ESTIMATED THAT ONE TO THREE PEOPLE DIE IN RESTRAINTS
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50036 TODAY I'D LIKE TO SAY I'M VERY PRO PSYCHIATRY BUT VERY ANTI FORCE
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50037 I DON'T THINK FORCE IS EFFECTIVE AS TREATMENT AND I THINK USING FORCE IS A TERRIBLE THING TO DO TO ANOTHER PERSON WITH A
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50038 EVENTUALLY I CAME TO LOS ANGELES TO TEACH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW SCHOOL
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50039 I FELT THAT IF I COULD MANAGE WITHOUT MEDICATION I COULD PROVE THAT AFTER ALL I WASN'T REALLY MENTALLY ILL IT WAS SOME
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50040 AFTER RETURNING FROM A TRIP TO OXFORD I MARCHED INTO KAPLAN'S OFFICE HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THE CORNER CROUCHED DOWN
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50041 ALL AROUND ME I SENSED EVIL BEINGS POISED WITH DAGGERS
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50042 THEY'D SLICE ME UP IN THIN SLICES OR MAKE ME SWALLOW HOT COALS
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50043 EVEN IN THIS STATE WHAT HE ACCURATELY DESCRIBED AS ACUTELY AND FORWARDLY PSYCHOTIC I REFUSED TO TAKE MORE MEDICATION
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50044 IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE APPOINTMENT WITH KAPLAN I WENT TO SEE DR
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50045 MARDER A SCHIZOPHRENIA EXPERT WHO WAS FOLLOWING ME FOR MEDICATION SIDE EFFECTS
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50046 YOU NEED TO LEAVE IF YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT' SAID MARDER
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50048 TELL THEM NOT TO KILL ME
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50049 TELL THEM NOT TO KILL ME
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50050 WHAT HAVE I DONE WRONG
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50051 I THINK YOU NEED TO BE IN THE HOSPITAL
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50052 YOU'RE OFFERING TO PUT ME IN HOSPITALS
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50053 HOSPITALS ARE BAD THEY'RE MAD THEY'RE SAD
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50054 ONE MUST STAY AWAY
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50055 THE WALL THAT KEPT ME ELYN PROFESSOR SAKS SEPARATE FROM THAT INSANE WOMAN HOSPITALIZED YEARS
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50056 EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS ILLNESS SAYS I SHOULDN'T BE HERE BUT I AM
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50057 THEY'RE DIFFERENT FROM ME AND YOU
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50058 AND I AM I THINK FOR THREE REASONS FIRST I'VE HAD EXCELLENT TREATMENT
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50059 SECOND I HAVE MANY CLOSE FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS WHO KNOW ME AND KNOW MY ILLNESS
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50060 THESE RELATIONSHIPS HAVE GIVEN MY LIFE A MEANING AND A DEPTH AND THEY ALSO HELPED ME NAVIGATE MY LIFE IN THE FACE OF
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50061 THIS IS A PLACE THAT NOT ONLY ACCOMMODATES MY NEEDS BUT ACTUALLY EMBRACES THEM
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50062 IT'S ALSO A VERY INTELLECTUALLY STIMULATING PLACE AND OCCUPYING MY MIND WITH COMPLEX PROBLEMS HAS BEEN
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50063 THERE ARE PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA AND THESE PEOPLE MAY BE YOUR SPOUSE THEY MAY BE YOUR CHILD THEY MAY BE YOUR
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50064 THEY WOULDN'T EXPERIENCE RESTRAINTS AS WE WOULD
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50065 WE NEED TO INVEST MORE RESOURCES INTO RESEARCH AND TREATMENT OF MENTAL ILLNESS
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50066 THE BETTER WE UNDERSTAND THESE ILLNESSES THE BETTER THE TREATMENTS WE CAN PROVIDE AND THE BETTER THE TREATMENTS WE CAN PROVIDE THE MORE WE CAN OFFER
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50067 ALSO WE MUST STOP CRIMINALIZING MENTAL ILLNESS
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50068 AMERICAN PRISONS AND JAILS ARE FILLED WITH PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS AND MANY OF THEM ARE THERE BECAUSE THEY NEVER
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50069 A MESSAGE TO THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AND TO THE PRESS ON THE WHOLE YOU'VE DONE A WONDERFUL JOB
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50070 PLEASE CONTINUE TO LET US SEE CHARACTERS IN YOUR MOVIES YOUR PLAYS YOUR COLUMNS WHO SUFFER WITH SEVERE MENTAL
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50071 RECENTLY A FRIEND POSED A QUESTION IF THERE WERE A PILL I COULD TAKE THAT WOULD INSTANTLY CURE ME WOULD I TAKE IT
trainval/f6CILJA110Y/50072 MY PSYCHOSIS ON THE OTHER HAND IS A WAKING NIGHTMARE IN WHICH MY DEVILS ARE SO TERRIFYING THAT ALL MY ANGELS HAVE ALREADY
trainval/f6nQJoEk7Ko/50001 YOU'RE SO BRAVE TO BE GOING AWAY TO CHINA TO GIVE UP YOUR JOB IN ENGLAND AND SO ON BUT HONESTLY I DIDN'T FEEL
trainval/f6nQJoEk7Ko/50002 YOU MEET PEOPLE
trainval/f6nQJoEk7Ko/50003 AND YOU FIND THE FREEDOM TO TRY NEW THINGS AND TO DO NEW THINGS WHICH YOU WOULDN'T HAVE OTHERWISE
trainval/f6nQJoEk7Ko/50004 SO ULTIMATELY WHEN I LOOK IT BACK AT WHAT DOING TO SHANGHAI DID TO ME 12 YEARS AGO WHAT HAPPENED IS I
trainval/f6nQJoEk7Ko/50005 I HAVEN'T TRIED IT
trainval/f6nQJoEk7Ko/50006 HE CHOSE TO NO LONGER FEEL HUNGRY AGAIN
trainval/f6nQJoEk7Ko/50007 AND THE HUNGER WENT
trainval/f6nQJoEk7Ko/50008 NEXT HE FOCUSED ON THE BEATINGS
trainval/f6nQJoEk7Ko/50009 IN THE END HE CHOSE TO NO LONGER BE SCARED AFTER ALL THEY WERE GOING TO BEAT HIM ANYWAY WHY BE SCARED
trainval/f6nQJoEk7Ko/50010 THEY BEAT EVERYONE ELSE BUT HIM
trainval/f6nQJoEk7Ko/50013 THE NEXT DAY THEY DIDN'T BEAT HIM EITHER OR THE NEXT DAY
trainval/f6nQJoEk7Ko/50014 I WENT IN AND BOUGHT POINT SIX TWO
trainval/f6nQJoEk7Ko/50016 WHAT ARE YOU CURIOUS ABOUT
trainval/F6NU0DMjv0Y/50001 NOW A SECOND QUESTION
trainval/F6NU0DMjv0Y/50002 AGAIN A SHOW OF HANDS HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE EVER LOOKED TO SEE WHO EDITED THE DICTIONARY
trainval/F6NU0DMjv0Y/50003 BUT WHO LOOKS AT THE FRONT MATTER OF DICTIONARIES
trainval/F6NU0DMjv0Y/50004 ARE YOU BOTHERED BY LANGUAGE FADS AND LANGUAGE CHANGE OR DO YOU FIND IT FUN
trainval/F6NU0DMjv0Y/50005 WELL YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/F6NU0DMjv0Y/50006 LANGUAGE JUST DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY
trainval/F6NU0DMjv0Y/50007 I HOPE THAT WHAT YOU CAN DO IS FIND LANGUAGE CHANGE NOT WORRISOME
trainval/F6Qo8IDsVNg/50001 AND YET YOU ACCEPT THE MEETING INVITATION AND YOU GO
trainval/F6Qo8IDsVNg/50002 I'M TALKING ABOUT TIME
trainval/F6Qo8IDsVNg/50003 AND COLLABORATION IS KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF ANY ENTERPRISE
trainval/F6Qo8IDsVNg/50004 AND A WELL RUN MEETING CAN YIELD REALLY POSITIVE ACTIONABLE RESULTS
trainval/F6Qo8IDsVNg/50005 AND WE'RE MISERABLE NOT BECAUSE THE OTHER GUY CAN'T RUN A GOOD MEETING IT'S BECAUSE OF MAS OUR MINDLESS ACCEPT SYNDROME
trainval/F6Qo8IDsVNg/50006 THERE'S THE MODERATOR WHO HAS NO IDEA HOW TO RUN THE MEETING
trainval/F6Qo8IDsVNg/50007 YOU'D MAKE A STINK
trainval/F6Qo8IDsVNg/50008 IT'S RIGHT AT OUR FINGERTIPS LITERALLY
trainval/F73O3Sim0Wo/50001 DURING MY VISIT I'VE BEEN ESPECIALLY HONORED TO MEET SOME OF BRITAIN'S MOST EXTRAORDINARY WOMEN
trainval/F73O3Sim0Wo/50002 THE MEN IN MY LIFE TAUGHT ME SOME IMPORTANT THINGS AS WELL
trainval/F73O3Sim0Wo/50003 BUT WHEN WE MET BARACK WAS A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER
trainval/F73O3Sim0Wo/50004 YOU'RE GOING TO WRITE THE NEXT CHAPTER IN HISTORY
trainval/F73O3Sim0Wo/50005 AND THIS SCHOOL NAMED AFTER THE U
trainval/F73O3Sim0Wo/50006 WE LOVE YOU
trainval/F73O3Sim0Wo/50007 THANK YOU SO MUCH
trainval/F8bM8K7WSR8/50001 WHAT ABOUT THE IDEA OF THE PLURALITY OF THE WORLDS ABOUT LIFE ON OTHER PLANETS
trainval/F8bM8K7WSR8/50002 IN FACT I'M BORROWING HERE FROM ONE OF THOSE VERY POPULAR BOOKS OF THE TIME
trainval/F8bM8K7WSR8/50003 AND HERE BEGINS 400 YEARS OF FRUSTRATION OF
trainval/F8bM8K7WSR8/50004 AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THE EVIDENCE FOR THAT
trainval/F8bM8K7WSR8/50005 WE DON'T WANT TO GO BLIND BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MANY POSSIBILITIES AND THERE IS NOT TOO MUCH LAB AND
trainval/F8bM8K7WSR8/50007 LET'S THINK OF LIFE AS THAT ENTIRE PLANET BECAUSE IN A SENSE IT IS
trainval/f8nkcRMZKV4/50002 RAPHAEL DON'T MAKE ME COME OVER THERE
trainval/F8pUtbSgrxc/50001 IN FACT IT WAS MY FRIENDS AND MY FAMILY WHO TAUGHT ME A NEW SKILL
trainval/F8pUtbSgrxc/50002 THERE IS NO TRY
trainval/F8pUtbSgrxc/50003 I CALL IT RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW
trainval/F8pUtbSgrxc/50004 DON'T LET US PUT PRESSURE ON YOU BECAUSE WE'RE FASTER THAN YOU
trainval/F8pUtbSgrxc/50005 SO I DO WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE MYSELF FEEL HAPPY
trainval/F8pUtbSgrxc/50006 TAKE YOUR TIME
trainval/F8pUtbSgrxc/50007 I TAKE THEM TO THE PARK
trainval/F8pUtbSgrxc/50008 I CAN'T BELIEVE IT
trainval/F8pUtbSgrxc/50009 IT'S A SMALL WORD
trainval/F8pUtbSgrxc/50010 YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN TO BE NIMBLE AND AGILE
trainval/F8pUtbSgrxc/50011 BIT BY BIT I'M MAKING IT HAPPEN
trainval/F8pUtbSgrxc/50012 I PEDAL EVERY DAY
trainval/F8R7S4AoGhs/50001 AND I SPECIFICALLY LOVED ONE EXPERIENCE IN GENERAL WHICH WAS MY CLASS IMPROVISATION
trainval/F8R7S4AoGhs/50002 I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER HAD A TIME IN YOUR LIFE WHERE YOU DID SOMETHING AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU
trainval/F8R7S4AoGhs/50005 THAT'S WHAT I DID
trainval/F8R7S4AoGhs/50006 I SAID I'M GOING TO OPEN A THEATER
trainval/F8R7S4AoGhs/50007 NONE OF YOU CAME I'M OVER IT
trainval/F8R7S4AoGhs/50008 THIS IS WHAT THIS GROUP IS
trainval/f8U2GwInI9o/50001 WE ARE JUST HEARING BOMBS DRONES F 16S
trainval/f8U2GwInI9o/50002 AND THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TO YOU TODAY
trainval/f8U2GwInI9o/50003 AND THIS WENT ON FOR ABOUT FOUR WEEKS DURING WHICH THE WORLD AND I AND PERHAPS YOU TOO
trainval/fa6ERdxyYdo/50001 SO I SAID YES WITH TWO CAVEATS
trainval/fa6ERdxyYdo/50002 HE LEFT AND WE DIDN'T SEE HIM FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS
trainval/fa6ERdxyYdo/50003 WE RECENTLY BROUGHT IN AN EXHIBIT FROM THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM THAT WAS FIGHTING THE
trainval/fa6ERdxyYdo/50004 WHAT DO GOATS EAT
trainval/fa7SkR2fz3M/50001 WITH INDIAN CLASSICAL MUSIC IT COMES FROM AN ORAL TRADITION
trainval/fa7SkR2fz3M/50002 IT'S MUCH MORE SUBJECTIVE
trainval/fa7SkR2fz3M/50003 IT HAS SPONTANEOUS CREATIVITY
trainval/fa7SkR2fz3M/50004 MENDEL BUT ALSO THROUGH ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE BENGALI RENAISSANCE OR
trainval/fa7SkR2fz3M/50005 SO THESE FOUR WORDS AGAIN
trainval/fa7SkR2fz3M/50006 CHANCE HAS ITS PLAY
trainval/fa7SkR2fz3M/50008 I WAS LOOKING FOR A TABLA PLAYER TO PLAY A GIG WITH ME THE FOLLOWING WEEK
trainval/fa7SkR2fz3M/50009 AND I COULDN'T FIND ANYONE
trainval/fa7SkR2fz3M/50010 I WAS ABOUT 17 I WAS PLAYING FLAMENCO GUITAR WITH HIM AND HE WAS PLAYING BEAUTIFULLY ON THE TABLA AND I JUST WONDERED WHAT HAD
trainval/fa7SkR2fz3M/50011 I'VE HAD LOTS OF SITUATIONS LIKE THAT BUT I KIND OF ULTIMATELY THINK THAT THAT IS
trainval/FAubx3BBgLk/50001 WHY STUDY TROLLS
trainval/FAubx3BBgLk/50002 AFTER ALL EVEN INTERNET USERS WHO DON'T THINK THEY KNOW MUCH ABOUT TROLLING HAVE LIKELY ENCOUNTERED A WHOLE
trainval/FAubx3BBgLk/50003 IT CAN TAKE MANY FORMS FROM HARMLESS PRANKS ALL THE WAY TO BEHAVIORS THAT MEET THE LEGAL
trainval/FAubx3BBgLk/50004 IT DOES HOWEVER CALL INTO QUESTION THE LINE THAT'S POSITED BETWEEN THOSE WHO
trainval/FAubx3BBgLk/50005 GOOD AND BAD CLEAN AND DIRTY ACCEPTABLE AND TABOO THERE EXISTS A GREAT DEAL OF OVERLAP BETWEEN AND IN FACT
trainval/FauPVZxDXxk/50001 AND WE ALMOST NEVER SAW A REEF HIT ZERO
trainval/Fb2J5eDoFko/50001 SEEMS TO BE THE UNDERTONE TO MANY OF THESE CONVERSATIONS
trainval/Fb2J5eDoFko/50002 AS A RESEARCHER WORKING IN THE FIELD OF CULTURAL STUDIES I AM WELL AWARE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO REPRESENTATION IN OUR
trainval/Fb2J5eDoFko/50003 FROM SOAP OPERAS TO FASHION CULTURAL PRODUCTS CODED AS FEMININE ARE GENERALLY REGARDED AS
trainval/Fb2J5eDoFko/50004 EVEN NOW IN THE WEST AFTER THREE WAVES OF FEMINISM AND A POSSIBLE FOURTH BLOSSOMING AT THIS POINT
trainval/Fb2J5eDoFko/50005 AND ALL TOO OFTEN WHEN WE DO SEE WOMEN REPRESENTED IN THE CULTURE IT'S THROUGH WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE MALE
trainval/Fb2J5eDoFko/50006 UNSURPRISINGLY THIS HAS MAJOR REPERCUSSIONS FOR HOW GIRLS AND WOMEN VIEW THEMSELVES
trainval/Fb2J5eDoFko/50007 WHY AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME ARE SOME YOUNG WOMEN CHOOSING TO SELF
trainval/Fb2J5eDoFko/50008 IT CREATES WHAT IT NAMES
trainval/Fb2J5eDoFko/50009 CONVENIENTLY ENOUGH THIS BRINGS US BACK TO ONE OF THOSE BUZZWORDS SO BELOVED BY
trainval/Fb2J5eDoFko/50010 AND THAT WORD IS NARCISSISM
trainval/Fb2J5eDoFko/50011 PEOPLE WANT TO TALK
trainval/Fb2J5eDoFko/50012 IS TAKEN TO REPRESENT EVERYTHING THAT IS WRONG WITH HER GENERATION
trainval/Fb2J5eDoFko/50013 AND ALTHOUGH THE ARTICLE GOES ON TO ULTIMATELY DEBUNK THIS IDEA THAT MILLENNIALS ARE WITHOUT HOPE
trainval/Fb2J5eDoFko/50014 DE BEAUVOIR NOTES THAT A WOMAN WHEN ADMIRING OR SHE PUTS IT
trainval/Fb2J5eDoFko/50015 BECAUSE HERE WE HAVE FOR THE FIRST TIME THANKS TO TECHNOLOGY A WAY FOR THEM TO HOLD ON
trainval/Fb2J5eDoFko/50016 TO GIVE THEMSELVES COMMUNITIES AND ROLE MODELS WHERE THERE ARE NONE STRIVING FOR VISIBILITY IN A
trainval/Fb2J5eDoFko/50017 AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR WOMEN IN MINORITIES
trainval/Fb2J5eDoFko/50018 EVEN THE CHARGE OF NARCISSISM BECOMES SO MUCH MORE COMPLEX WHEN CONSIDERED IN RELATION TO
trainval/Fb3yp4uJhq0/50001 IT IS A PERFECT CUSTOM PRISON
trainval/Fb3yp4uJhq0/50002 WHAT WAS STRIKING WAS JUST HOW MUCH TROUBLE WE WERE HAVING BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY
trainval/Fb3yp4uJhq0/50003 LIKE THE HYSTERIA OF OLD THIS HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH GENDER AND WITH WHOSE STORIES WE BELIEVE
trainval/Fb3yp4uJhq0/50004 AND IN NORWAY RESEARCHERS ARE RUNNING A PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIAL ON A CANCER DRUG THAT IN SOME PATIENTS
trainval/Fb3yp4uJhq0/50005 BUT IT GAVE ME HOPE THAT I COULD BE TREATED
trainval/Fb3yp4uJhq0/50006 I HAD A SICK BODY THAT WAS ALL
trainval/Fb3yp4uJhq0/50007 THE PROBLEM IS THAT THIS CAN CAUSE REAL HARM
trainval/fbAj9JfCXng/50001 WE USED TO THINK WE'RE ALONE IN THIS BUT NOW WE KNOW WE'RE NOT
trainval/fbAj9JfCXng/50002 SOME OF THE MONARCHS WERE HEALTHY
trainval/fbAj9JfCXng/50003 THEY HAD NO DISEASE
trainval/fbAj9JfCXng/50004 THEY CANNOT PREVENT THIS
trainval/fbAj9JfCXng/50005 THEY CAN ALSO NOT MEDICATE THEMSELVES
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50001 THEY CERTAINLY ARE IN MINE
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50002 I REMEMBER BEING A TEENAGER DOING EXCHANGES WITH A STUDENT IN FRANCE AND WE HAD BOWLS OF HOT CHOCOLATE WITH
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50003 NOW THAT'S NOT AN AESTHETIC PROBLEM
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50004 I'M NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT BODY IMAGE THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER TALK
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50005 WE KNOW THAT DIABETES IS ON THE RISE
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50006 ALL IN THIS AMAZING LITTLE PILLS
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50007 BUT DIET REALLY JUST MEANS THE WAY THAT WE EAT AND WHAT WE ARE EATING
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50008 SO LET S TAKE BUTTER AS AN EXAMPLE
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50010 THAT S ACTUALLY WHAT THE RESEARCH SHOWED
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50011 NO IT DIDN T SAY THAT BUT THAT S THE MEDIA REPORTING
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50012 SO HERE S WHAT I VE SEEN HAPPEN
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50013 AND HERE S WHAT HAPPENED
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50014 MOM AND I EMBARKED ON A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIETS
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50015 WE WERE BOTH ILL BY ABOUT DAY 3 IN BED SO WE DECIDED
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50016 THEN WE TRIED SOMETHING ELSE CALLED THE SCARSDALE DIET THAT INVOLVED EATING A DRY PIECE OF WHOLEMEAL TOAST IN THE MORNING WITH
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50017 YOU RE LUCKY IF YOU GRAB A SANDWICH ON THE WAY
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50018 EVERYTHING IS GRABBING ON THE RUN
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50019 EVERYTHING IS ON THE RUN
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50020 RUSH RUSH RUSH
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50021 GO BACK TO EATING LOTS OF FAT
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50022 BASICALLY RICE BUTTER AND SUGAR
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50023 REALLY SOLID EVIDENCE BEHIND THAT KIND OF A DIET
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50024 THE JAPANESE DIET
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50025 UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS FULL OF REFINED STARCH LOTS OF ADDED SUGARS ADDITIVES AND PRESERVATIVES AND WHATEVER ELSE
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50026 WE ABSOLUTELY MUST EAT MORE PLANT FOOD
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50027 MORE THAN A DECADE AGO NOW ACTUALLY I THINK
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50028 THAT STUDY SHOWED THAT THE AMERICANS WERE MUCH MORE CONCERNED AND WORRIED ABOUT THE FOODS THAT THEY BUY THEY WERE MUCH MORE
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50029 BUT AT SCHOOL WE HAD TO SAY GRACE BEFORE WE ATE OUR LUNCH
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50030 IT S ONLY WHEN YOU CHANGE FOR THE LONG TERM YOU CHANGE THE WAY YOUR THOUGHT PROCESSES WORK THAT S
trainval/fbeFn1Xcqo4/50031 AND I HOPE YOU LL AGREE WITH ME THAT THAT IS AN IDEA WORTH SPREADING
trainval/fBLErez9ljw/50001 A RESEARCH TEAM THAT I HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO BE A PART OF SOUGHT TO DETAIL THE EVOLUTION IN A SOCIETAL RELATIONSHIP
trainval/fBLErez9ljw/50002 KING WAS ASKING US TO THINK OF THE LARGER STRUCTURE OF THE WORLD AND HOW IT IS BEING CONSTRUCTED
trainval/fBLErez9ljw/50004 INDENTURED SERVANTS WERE BROUGHT HERE FROM EUROPE
trainval/fBLErez9ljw/50005 WE RE TOLD OUR VALUE THROUGH OUR CLOTHING SIZE OUR NUMERICAL AGE
trainval/fBLErez9ljw/50006 FOR YEARS ECONOMIC JUSTICE HAS BEEN EVOLVING TO SEEK OUT NEW WAYS TO BRING TOGETHER THE GLOBAL WORLD
trainval/fBLErez9ljw/50007 HUMANISTIC FEATS OF INTELLIGENCE BROUGHT TO US THE INTERNET
trainval/fBLErez9ljw/50008 WE HAVE ACCESS TO AN UNPARALLELED AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AT EVERY MOMENT OF
trainval/fBLErez9ljw/50009 SO BECAUSE OF THE SHARING ECONOMY ORGAN DONORSHIP INCREASED
trainval/fBLErez9ljw/50010 KEEP THE WORDS OF DR
trainval/fBLErez9ljw/50011 KING AND LET US CHANGE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ECONOMY
trainval/fBQnQTkhsq4/50001 THE MYTHS ABOUT THE HYMEN HAVE LIVED ON FOR CENTURIES BECAUSE THEY HAVE CULTURAL
trainval/fBQnQTkhsq4/50002 THAT COULD BE PLASTIC SURGERY KNOWN AS REVIRGINATION IT COULD BE VIALS OF BLOOD POURED
trainval/fBQnQTkhsq4/50003 IN NORWEGIAN IT IS EVEN CALLED THE VIRGIN MEMBRANE AND WITH THIS WE PICTURE
trainval/fBQnQTkhsq4/50004 IN OTHER WORDS HYMENS NATURALLY VARY A LOT IN LOOKS AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES
trainval/fBQnQTkhsq4/50005 IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE A VIRGIN OR NOT
trainval/fBQnQTkhsq4/50006 WHEN DOCTORS EXAMINED THEIR HYMENS THEY COULD ONLY FIND CLEAR SIGNS OF PENETRATION
trainval/fBQnQTkhsq4/50007 BUT THAT MAKES SENSE RIGHT
trainval/fbU9l46Lz7c/50001 REDUCTIONISM WOULD SAY
trainval/fbU9l46Lz7c/50002 IT WAS HANDED DOWN TO US BY THE GREEKS
trainval/fbU9l46Lz7c/50003 I'VE SEEN WAVES HAPPEN ON WATER
trainval/fbU9l46Lz7c/50004 THAT WOULDN'T QUIET BE CORRECT RIGHT
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50001 AND SO WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT MEETING THESE ASPIRATIONS
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50002 ARE THERE NEW WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN RISE TO MEET THESE ASPIRATIONS
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50003 BECAUSE IF WE DON'T I'M EXTREMELY WORRIED
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50004 THEIR ASPIRATIONS WENT UP
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50005 THEY UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO LIVE IN A PLACE LIKE NEW YORK CITY IN THE 1950S
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50006 WE GREW UP IN IOWA
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50007 I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL I WENT TO COLLEGE
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50009 JEFF SKOLL IS HERE
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50010 I RECOGNIZED THEM
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50011 AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE DID
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50013 WE PROVIDED EDUCATION
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50014 IT CAN'T BE DONE
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50015 IT'S A PREFERENTIAL OPTION FOR THE POOR
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50016 AND THEY SAID WELL THAT'S A NICE THOUGHT BUT IT'S JUST NOT COST EFFECTIVE
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50017 AND WE ARGUED WITH THE WORLD BANK
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50018 AND THEN A CRAZY THING HAPPENED
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50019 AND I SAID OK THAT'S IT RIGHT
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50020 YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO DROP ME
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50021 YOU'VE ALL HEARD THAT
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50022 THAT'S A NEGATIVE INTEREST RATE BOND
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50023 7 CENTS A KILOWATT HOUR
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50024 I'M PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD BANK
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50025 I CANNOT AND I WILL NOT PULL UP THE LADDER BEHIND ME
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50026 EVERYWHERE ASPIRATIONS ARE GOING UP
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50027 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50028 WE WILL MAKE THE INTRODUCTIONS
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50029 WE WILL EVEN PROVIDE FINANCING
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50030 WE WILL HELP YOU DO THAT
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50031 LOWEST BID 25 CENTS A KILOWATT HOUR FOR ZAMBIA
trainval/Fc1yN6uxZfQ/50032 IT DEPENDS ON THE QUALITY OF THE IDEAS
trainval/fCKNScHMBGE/50001 THEY SAID NO
trainval/fCKNScHMBGE/50002 MY HEART WAS IN AFGHANISTAN
trainval/fCKNScHMBGE/50003 I WANTED TO GO BACK HOME
trainval/fCKNScHMBGE/50005 WHAT CAN I DO FOR THEM
trainval/fCKNScHMBGE/50007 THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHY THEY DIDN'T TAKE ME AWAY
trainval/fCKNScHMBGE/50008 BUT EVERYBODY WAS HAPPY TO SEE ME
trainval/fCKNScHMBGE/50009 AND BY THAT TIME THE WOMEN ARE YELLING AND SCREAMING INSIDE THE CAR
trainval/fCKNScHMBGE/50010 THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND
trainval/fCKNScHMBGE/50012 WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU
trainval/fCKNScHMBGE/50013 I SAID NOTHING
trainval/fCKNScHMBGE/50014 THEY ARE TRAINING TO BE LAWYERS
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50001 AND NOT FROM THE POWER OF AN EDICT DOWN
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50002 NOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50003 BUT IN SOME PLACES AROUND THE WORLD LIKE SCANDINAVIA YOU ALREADY HAVE THAT
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50004 A FULL BATTERY COMES ON
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50005 AND YOU DRIVE ON
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50006 YOU DON'T DO IT AS A HUMAN BEING
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50007 YOU DO IT AS A MACHINE
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50008 IF YOU HAD CHARGE SPOTS EVERYWHERE AND YOU HAD BATTERY SWAP STATIONS EVERYWHERE HOW OFTEN WOULD YOU DO IT
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50009 AS A MATTER OF FACT WE ADDED TO THE CONTRACT
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50010 WE HAVE A BATTERY BAY
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50011 AND THESE PRICES ARE ACTUALLY WITH CLEAN ELECTRONS
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50012 SOME OF IT WILL GO BACK TO YOUR OWN POCKET
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50013 THINK OF IT AS A PROJECT THAT SPANS OVER ABOUT 10 YEARS
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50014 PERES I WILL BUILD YOU THE CARS
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50015 I KNOW MOST PEOPLE DON'T THINK OF ISRAEL AS A SMALL ISLAND BUT ISRAEL IS AN ISLAND IT'S A TRANSPORTATION ISLAND
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50016 WE DECIDED TO COME INTO THE U
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50017 AND PICK THE TWO BEST PLACES THE ONE WHERE YOU DIDN'T NEED ANY RANGE EXTENSION
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50018 HAWAII YOU CAN DRIVE AROUND THE ISLAND ON ONE BATTERY
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50019 AND IF YOU REALLY HAVE A LONG DAY YOU CAN SWITCH AND KEEP ON DRIVING AROUND THE ISLAND
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50020 THE SECOND ONE WAS THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA WHERE GAVIN NEWSOM CREATED A BEAUTIFUL POLICY ACROSS ALL THE MAYORS
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50021 NOW WE'RE RUNNING A STIMULUS PACKAGE
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50022 IT'S CALLED THE TRILLION DOLLAR STIMULUS PACKAGE
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50023 WE'RE GOING TO REVIVE THE ECONOMY
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50024 THAT'S ANOTHER 30 PERCENT DEMAND ON OIL
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50025 THAT'S ALL THE U
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50026 YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AT THAT POINT
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50027 WE GO BACK DOWN
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50028 WE HAVE ALL THESE REGIONS
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50030 WE THEN DECIDED TO SCALE IT UP
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50031 CHINA SOLVES IT BY AN EDICT
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50032 WE DON'T HAVE THE INDUSTRY SET RIGHT
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50033 I SHARED IT WITH A GENTLEMAN CALLED BOBBY KENNEDY JR
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50034 WHO IS ONE OF MY IDOLS
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50035 I TOLD HIM ONE OF THE REASONS THAT HIS UNCLE WAS REMEMBERED IS BECAUSE HE SAID WE'RE GOING TO SEND A
trainval/FcoJt2KLC9k/50036 WE DIDN'T SAY WE'RE GOING TO SEND A MAN 20 PERCENT TO THE MOON
trainval/fCt6PoTfPvg/50001 AND THEY SAID YEAH IT'S OKAY YOU CAN DO THAT
trainval/FD5ZKiSmoMU/50001 SO MANY EMOTIONS SEEM TO BE INSIDE OF IT
trainval/FD5ZKiSmoMU/50002 AND FOR HIM IT WASN'T SO MUCH THE WAY THE MUSIC GOES AS ABOUT WHAT IT
trainval/FD5ZKiSmoMU/50003 MOZART WAS THE SAME WAY
trainval/FD5ZKiSmoMU/50004 AND IN FACT AS MAN BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND MORE HIS COMPLEX AND AMBIVALENT NATURE HARMONY GREW
trainval/FD5ZKiSmoMU/50005 NOW THIS MOMENT SO FASCINATES ME
trainval/FD5ZKiSmoMU/50006 I FIND IT SUCH A PROFOUND ONE
trainval/FD5ZKiSmoMU/50007 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE MUSIC STOPS
trainval/FD5ZKiSmoMU/50008 IT'S THE WHY' PART OF IT
trainval/FD5ZKiSmoMU/50009 WELL THAT'S WHY I TAKE EVERY PERFORMANCE SO SERIOUSLY WHY IT MATTERS TO ME SO MUCH
trainval/FD5ZKiSmoMU/50010 IT SPEARHEADED A CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN WHICH ARTISTS LIKE CARUSO AND BESSIE SMITH WERE ON THE SAME
trainval/FD5ZKiSmoMU/50011 THE QUESTION REMAINS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE MUSIC STOPS
trainval/fddYApFEWfY/50001 WE'VE GOT TO GO OUT THERE AND CLEAN THIS THING UP
trainval/fddYApFEWfY/50002 I'D GO TO THE SUPERMARKET AND ALL OF MY FOOD IS PACKAGED IN PLASTIC
trainval/FdHJw0veVNY/50001 SO I SOON BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE PHENOMENON OF AN INTERNET TROLL
trainval/FdHJw0veVNY/50002 I ADMIT THIS RACE STUFF CAN BE KIND OF DIVISIVE
trainval/FdHJw0veVNY/50003 ALTHOUGH THE SUPPOSED MORONS ENGAGED IN WHAT APPEARED TO BE ORIGINAL THOUGHT
trainval/FdHJw0veVNY/50004 WHERE ARE THESE GUYS GETTING THEIR ARGUMENTS FROM
trainval/FdHJw0veVNY/50005 MY TIMELINE WAS PRETTY LIBERAL
trainval/FdHJw0veVNY/50006 TALKING BAD ABOUT AL SHARPTON AND BLACK LIVES MATTER
trainval/FdHJw0veVNY/50007 A LOT OF THESE GUYS WERE JUST REGULAR JOES
trainval/FdHJw0veVNY/50008 BUT IT IS THE WAY THAT I ARTICULATED RACE THAT MADE ME SOMEWHAT OF A DIGITAL LIGHTENING ROD
trainval/FdHJw0veVNY/50009 AND THAT IS A FERTILE GROUND FOR ALT FACTS TO GROW
trainval/FdHJw0veVNY/50010 AND SO WAS I
trainval/FdHJw0veVNY/50011 MIND YOU NOT ENOUGH COMPASSION LIKE I WANT TO BE FRIENDS
trainval/FdHJw0veVNY/50012 JOIN THE PARTY
trainval/FdHJw0veVNY/50013 THE WATER IS GREAT
trainval/FdHJw0veVNY/50014 THAT'S A DANGEROUS IMBALANCE
trainval/FdHJw0veVNY/50015 INTO CONTROVERSIAL TALKING POINTS
trainval/FdHJw0veVNY/50016 IT IS TIME WE START SEEING PEOPLE AS PEOPLE AND NOT SIMPLY THE IDEAS WE PROJECT ONTO THEM OR REACT
trainval/FdHJw0veVNY/50017 THEN WITH MY CELL PHONE I FLIPPED THE INTERNET AGAINST ITSELF AND BEGAN TO BROADCAST
trainval/FdHJw0veVNY/50018 THIS MADE THEM WANT TO LEAVE THE SAFETY OF THEIR LAPTOPS AND MEET US IN PERSON TO HAVE REAL CONVERSATIONS WITH REAL
trainval/FdHJw0veVNY/50019 AND WE DID THIS
trainval/fDV4fDWUo6U/50001 I PLAYED A SMALL ROLE IN HIS SUCCESS
trainval/fDV4fDWUo6U/50002 THEN I SAID
trainval/fDV4fDWUo6U/50003 ULTIMATELY I WAS ABLE TO BOWL FOR THE PURDUE BOWLING TEAM AS CAPTAIN AND WHEN IT CAME TIME TO GRADUATE
trainval/fDV4fDWUo6U/50004 HOW HARD CAN IT BE TO DESIGN A BOWLING BALL
trainval/fDV4fDWUo6U/50005 I WAS IN COMPLETE AWE BECAUSE THAT WAS LIKE THE BEST HE'S EVER BOWLED IN HIS ENTIRE LIFE
trainval/fDV4fDWUo6U/50006 AND I'M SITTING THERE AND I'M STRUGGLING TO GET A STRIKE
trainval/fDV4fDWUo6U/50007 MAN THAT WAS REALLY COOL TO WATCH
trainval/fDV4fDWUo6U/50008 BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/FdXUSZg9pcM/50001 LAWRENCE ISLAND IN 1997 WHEN I WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT IN THE UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA AT FAIRBANKS AND I JOURNEYED
trainval/FdXUSZg9pcM/50002 LAWRENCE ISLAND IN BERING STRAIT TO RECORD THE STORIES AND MEANINGS BEHIND THE LAST GENERATION OF TATTOO
trainval/FdXUSZg9pcM/50003 THERE ARE ALSO TATTOOS THAT MARKED IMPORTANT RITE OF PASSAGE CEREMONIES AND THERE WERE OTHER TATTOOS THAT CURED
trainval/fDzj9vRw5yM/50001 BUT WHEN SHE SHOWS A LESS MONOLITHIC CHARACTER OF HERSELF AND ULTIMATELY OF BLACK WOMEN WE DIDN'T LIKE THAT AS
trainval/fDzj9vRw5yM/50002 OR ROSA PARKS
trainval/fDzj9vRw5yM/50003 YOU'VE PUT IN THE HOURS YOU'VE DONE IT ENOUGH AND IT BECOMES SORT OF AUTOMATIC
trainval/fDzj9vRw5yM/50004 WELL I WANT TO GIVE YOU SOME DATES
trainval/fDzj9vRw5yM/50005 INSTEAD FACE HEAD ON THE FACT THAT THIS COUNTRY'S EXPERTISE IN SEGREGATION OPPRESSION AND RACISM
trainval/FEAM4xdCDLE/50001 AS I GOT CLOSER I WAS COMFORTED BY HER WARM SMILE
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50001 BUT I STUCK WITH IT
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50002 I LOVED THE MAJOR AND I WANTED TO DO IT
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50003 AND OUR FINAL ASSIGNMENT WE HAD TO PUT OUR DRAWINGS UP ON THE WALL FOR CRITIQUE
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50005 I DIDN'T EVEN GO TO ANY PARTIES WORKING ON MY DRAWING
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50006 OPEN YOUR EYES
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50007 ONLY 11 PERCENT OF ENGINEERS IN THE U
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50008 SO WHY DOES THIS MATTER
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50009 AND WITH HALF THE POPULATION BEING FEMALE WE DESERVE TO HAVE THE FEMALE PERSPECTIVE
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50010 IT WILL ONLY GET BETTER WITH THE FEMALE PERSPECTIVE
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50011 SHE SAID OKAY DEBBIE WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO MAJOR IN
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50012 AND I WAS SO WORRIED THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE MY FIRST F
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50013 THAT'S WHAT ENGINEERS BUILD
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50014 AND WHAT AN AMAZING SKILL SET
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50015 HOW EMPOWERING TO BE ABLE TO BUILD WHATEVER YOU WANT
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50016 I KNOW YOU WILL
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50017 THE WORLD WAS WAITING FOR THIS
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50018 AND THEY GET THEM INTERESTED IN MATH AND SCIENCE
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50019 I HAVE A DEGREE
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50020 AND SO I WOULD SAY WELL WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE TOY
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50021 DO YOU TRUST ME
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50022 I SAID YEAH YEAH
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50023 WE'RE NOT IN A MOVIE
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50024 WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50025 YOU NEED TO APPLY
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50026 YOU CAN DO IT AND I'LL HELP YOU
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50027 JUST BECAUSE THIS IS THE WAY THINGS ARE DOESN'T MEAN IT'S HOW THEY HAVE TO BE
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50028 AND IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE INCLUDE THAT PERSPECTIVE
trainval/FEeTLopLkEo/50029 IT COULDN'T BE MORE REWARDING
trainval/fenV3W7hQtw/50001 SO AS SCIENTISTS WE STARTED WONDERING WHAT OTHER TYPES OF PHYSICAL PHENOMENA PRODUCE TINY
trainval/fenV3W7hQtw/50002 THAT WE COULD NOW USE OUR CAMERAS TO MEASURE
trainval/fenV3W7hQtw/50003 THIS IS OUR TEAM
trainval/FETryXMpDl8/50001 WE WERE PART OF DECISION MAKING
trainval/FfwFUjVEIl4/50001 I LEARNED WHAT IT FELT LIKE TO BE TRULY COLD
trainval/fgfQLTIhi1U/50001 WE HAVE SOME MONEY
trainval/fgfQLTIhi1U/50002 I CAME HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 1998 TO WIN A CRAZY BET
trainval/fgfQLTIhi1U/50003 I UNDOUBTEDLY I FEEL HAPPIER
trainval/fgfQLTIhi1U/50004 SO I HAD A LOOK
trainval/fgfQLTIhi1U/50005 I KNOW THAT MILLIONAIRE HOUSEHOLDS IN THE USA THERE'S 5
trainval/fgfQLTIhi1U/50006 I'D ALREADY WRITTEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL BOOK IN THE UK IN WHICH I WON A 100 BET
trainval/fgfQLTIhi1U/50007 I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE LINING THEIR POCKETS
trainval/fgfQLTIhi1U/50008 WE DO SOMETHING SMARTER THAN JUST TAXING THE HELL OUT OF THESE PEOPLE
trainval/fgfQLTIhi1U/50009 YOUNG PEOPLE COULD GET JOBS GOING OUT TO WORK FOR THESE CHARITIES AND DOING THINGS IN SOCIETY THAT HELPED
trainval/fgfQLTIhi1U/50010 BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN TRIED
trainval/fgfQLTIhi1U/50011 JUST THINK OF ALL THE DODGY DEALINGS THAT GO ON AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET
trainval/fgfQLTIhi1U/50012 BUT IS THIS NAVE
trainval/fgfQLTIhi1U/50013 YOU'VE MADE IT COMPULSORY FOR US TO HAVE A BIRTH CERTIFICATE
trainval/fHfhorJnAEI/50001 SO WE USE SOME CLEVER IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES TO GET A VERY ACCURATE MEASUREMENT OF THE COLOR AT EACH
trainval/fHfhorJnAEI/50002 SO AS SCIENTISTS WE STARTED WONDERING WHAT OTHER TYPES OF PHYSICAL PHENOMENA PRODUCE TINY MOTIONS
trainval/fHhIkynELNQ/50001 THEY ARE NOT AFRAID OF USING CRAZY INGREDIENTS LIKE TONKA BEANS FROM AMAZONIA
trainval/fHhIkynELNQ/50002 IS IT GOLDEN BLOND
trainval/fHhIkynELNQ/50003 IS IT AMBER BLOND
trainval/FI8c14giiWQ/50001 AND THAT'S NOT REALLY A NEW SCIENCE YOU JUST DO A SURVEY AND YOU COLLECT IT MAYBE WITH AN APP
trainval/FI8c14giiWQ/50002 BUT DOES HAVE TO COMMUTE LIKE TWO HOURS PER DAY AND SO ALSO DOES NOT HAVE THAT MUCH MORE TIME TO
trainval/fi8CYv9Dcr0/50001 WHY IS THIS SO DIFFERENT FOR PEOPLE
trainval/fi8CYv9Dcr0/50002 WE'VE MET CHAMPIONS ALL OVER THE PUBLIC SECTOR KEEN TO MAKE THESE KINDS OF DIFFERENCES
trainval/fIqABIcKIvs/50001 THEY IN FACT BERATE IT
trainval/fIqABIcKIvs/50002 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT POPULAR TV
trainval/fIqABIcKIvs/50003 THAT IS SEPARATE AND APART FROM THE ANIMAL KINGDOM
trainval/fIqABIcKIvs/50004 THE OTHER THING ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS IS THAT WE LOVE TO BE ENTERTAINED
trainval/fIqABIcKIvs/50005 WHY HAS TELEVISION ENTERTAINMENT EVOLVED THE WAY IT HAS
trainval/fIqABIcKIvs/50006 WE TALKED TO OVER 3000 INDIVIDUALS ALMOST 3600 AGED 18 TO 70 AND WE
trainval/fIqABIcKIvs/50007 AND ON A FACTUAL BASIS OVER 80 PERCENT OF THE U
trainval/fIqABIcKIvs/50008 S MOST POPULAR SHOWS ARE EXPORTED AROUND THE WORLD
trainval/fIqABIcKIvs/50009 AND FOR THE WAY IN WHICH I'M GOING TO PRESENT THE DATA I WANT TO THANK TED COMMUNITY SUPERSTAR HANS
trainval/fIqABIcKIvs/50010 THE SOCIALLY IRREVERENT HIPPIE SHOW ROWAN AND MARTIN'S LAUGH IN
trainval/fIqABIcKIvs/50011 ONE BASIC INSTINCT REMAINS
trainval/fIqABIcKIvs/50012 WE'RE ANIMALS WE NEED OUR MOMS
trainval/fIqABIcKIvs/50013 THERE HAS NOT BEEN A DECADE OF TELEVISION WITHOUT A DEFINITIVE DOMINANT TV MOM
trainval/fIqABIcKIvs/50014 SO THANKS VERY MUCH
trainval/FIrgjCNcDBI/50001 NOW AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT IS A VERY TIME CONSUMING LABOR INTENSIVE AND COSTLY PROCESS
trainval/FIrgjCNcDBI/50002 IT CARRIES A VARIETY OF SENSORS AND THE PHOTO QUALITY OF SOME OF THESE SENSORS CAN BE AS HIGH AS
trainval/fIw07IX6rG8/50001 I WANTED TO SHARE IT WITH YOU TODAY BECAUSE THOSE ESSENTIAL THINGS ARE WHAT I'D LIKE TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT
trainval/fIw07IX6rG8/50002 BEING WITH OURSELVES AND BEING WITH EACH OTHER
trainval/fIw07IX6rG8/50003 PERHAPS YOU WILL FEEL THE SAME
trainval/fIw07IX6rG8/50004 BUT ANYONE WHO'S EVER RAISED A CHILD PLAYED WITH A CHILD NURTURED A CHILD OR TAUGHT A CHILD
trainval/fIw07IX6rG8/50005 WE COME IN WITH THIS CAPABILITY OF BEING PRESENT WITH OURSELVES AT ALL TIMES
trainval/fIw07IX6rG8/50006 AND IN THAT SPACE I SENSE MY CREATIVITY MY AUTHENTICITY AND MY OWN AGENCY
trainval/fIw07IX6rG8/50007 I AM GOING TO IMAGINE THAT IS THE SAME FOR EACH OF YOU
trainval/fIXnJycnkaQ/50001 SO FOR ME THE SENTENCE WE ARE WHAT WE EAT IS A VERY LITERAL ONE
trainval/fIXnJycnkaQ/50002 AND TILL TODAY WHEN I AM HUNGRY I DON'T HAVE MICHELIN STARS FANTASIES ABOUT
trainval/fIXnJycnkaQ/50003 WHEN I'M HUNGRY I'M THINKING
trainval/fIXnJycnkaQ/50004 IT'S TO ALLOW THE WHOLE WORLD TO ENTER OUR KITCHEN
trainval/fJ36gCwKVec/50001 NOW I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO GO AROUND AND SAY OH MY GOD I LOVE THAT SKIRT YOU SHOULD WEAR THAT EVERYDAY OH MY GOD
trainval/fJ36gCwKVec/50002 IF SOMEONE IS TRYING TO CROSS THE ROAD HELP THEM CROSS THE ROAD
trainval/fJ36gCwKVec/50003 I REMEMBER THAT DAY I PROMISED MYSELF I WOULD NEVER HELP ANYONE AGAIN
trainval/FJFxLQCo83U/50001 OR BETTER YET COME NEAR WHERE I LIVE ON EL CAJON BLV
trainval/FJFxLQCo83U/50002 YOU KNOW FIFTEEN MILES
trainval/FJFxLQCo83U/50003 THATS NOT AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION EITHER
trainval/FjibavNwOUI/50001 SO LET'S START WITH HIGH EXTROVERSION
trainval/FjibavNwOUI/50002 THAT'S COMPARABLE TO NOT SMOKING
trainval/FjibavNwOUI/50004 GO BUY A FRIEND A PRESENT AND COME BACK IN 3 HOURS
trainval/FjibavNwOUI/50005 AND COMMUNITIES ARE TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT
trainval/FjibavNwOUI/50006 NOT JUST YOUR TEXTS AND TWEETS BUT INCREASINGLY YOUR SPOKEN WORDS AS WELL
trainval/FjibavNwOUI/50007 THE QUESTION THEN
trainval/FjnGdiqk96Y/50001 HE ACTUALLY BELIEVED YOU HAD TO INGEST IT THROUGH YOUR MOUTH AND IN 1854 WHEN CHOLERA BROKE
trainval/FjnGdiqk96Y/50002 AND IN THIS CASE IT CHANGED THE WORLD
trainval/FjnGdiqk96Y/50003 BUT I ALSO LOVE DR
trainval/FjnGdiqk96Y/50004 WE NEED TO LOOK AT MANY OF US AS THE EXPERT
trainval/FjnGdiqk96Y/50005 AND THEY ARE ACTUALLY PROPOSING A SOCIAL ENTERPRISE THAT WOULD HELP CREATE JOBS AND REDUCE BIKE
trainval/FjnGdiqk96Y/50006 IN THE END WE DECIDED THAT THE WATER HYACINTH WAS THE ACTUAL ICON THAT MADE THE MOST SENSE BECAUSE IT WAS THE
trainval/FjvjSlpJoqo/50001 WE'RE BACK WHERE WE WERE IN THE 1970S
trainval/fkPISY2Vg5k/50001 HE LOST BADLY BUT EVERY DEMOCRAT DOES
trainval/fkPISY2Vg5k/50002 BUT YEAH WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ARKANSAS
trainval/fkPISY2Vg5k/50003 ARE WE KIND OF STIGMATIZING PEOPLE FROM ARKANSAS AND THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY
trainval/fkPISY2Vg5k/50004 OR ARE THERE MORE SYSTEMATIC FACTORS AT WORK
trainval/fkPISY2Vg5k/50005 AND THEY ASK A SERIES OF REALLY INTERESTING QUESTIONS
trainval/fkPISY2Vg5k/50006 IT'S ABOUT WHO YOU LIVE WITH
trainval/fkPISY2Vg5k/50007 RACISM IS PREDICTABLE
trainval/fkPISY2Vg5k/50008 THAT WAS JOHN KERRY'S HOME STATE
trainval/FKQavJZHRJU/50001 I WATCHED THE MASTER ON A TAB OF ACID THEN PERFORMED AFTER AND YET MYSELF WAS AN UNPARALLEL
trainval/FKQavJZHRJU/50002 SO POUR THE GIN
trainval/FKQavJZHRJU/50003 AND HOW WE TREAT OURSELVES STARTS WITH HOW WE SEE OURSELVES
trainval/FktsFcooIG8/50001 EVERYBODY BEGINS TO MOVE AROUND AND YOUR TASK IS TO KEEP TRACK OF WHO HAD A COAT AT THE
trainval/FktsFcooIG8/50002 THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE COSTLY PROPOSITION
trainval/FktsFcooIG8/50003 WHEN WE MEASURE THEM IN THE LAB THEY'RE REALLY BAD
trainval/FktsFcooIG8/50004 SO THESE KINDS OF RESULTS REALLY MAKES TWO MAIN POINTS
trainval/FktsFcooIG8/50005 AND SO WE NEED AND WE'RE WORKING ON UNDERSTANDING WHAT ARE THOSE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS SO THAT WE CAN REALLY THEN
trainval/FktsFcooIG8/50006 THAT'S THE POINT OF REHABILITATION OR EDUCATION
trainval/FktsFcooIG8/50007 THAT'S WHAT WE JUST DID
trainval/fKyljukBE70/50001 SO PERFECTLY ORGANIZED A STRUCTURE IT WAS HARD NOT TO ATTRIBUTE DIVINITY TO IT
trainval/fKyljukBE70/50002 BECAUSE WE KEPT ON SEEING THIS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODY
trainval/fKyljukBE70/50003 ONE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES I HAD WAS ONE PERSON WAS WORKING ON A REALLY INTERESTING MICROMAGNETIC RESONANCE
trainval/fKyljukBE70/50004 I GOT THE DATA
trainval/fKyljukBE70/50005 AND MY JOB WAS TO WRITE MANY OF THE ALGORITHMS AND CODE FOR NASA TO DO VIRTUAL SURGERY IN PREPARATION FOR
trainval/fKyljukBE70/50006 NOT ONLY IN DISEASE MANAGEMENT BUT ALSO THINGS THAT ALLOWED US TO SEE THINGS ABOUT THE BODY THAT
trainval/fKyljukBE70/50007 I REMEMBER ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES WE WERE LOOKING AT COLLAGEN
trainval/fKyljukBE70/50008 AND YOUR ENTIRE BODY EVERYTHING YOUR HAIR SKIN BONE NAILS EVERYTHING IS MADE OF COLLAGEN
trainval/fKyljukBE70/50009 AND IT'S A KIND OF ROPE LIKE STRUCTURE THAT TWIRLS AND SWIRLS LIKE THIS
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50001 LET ME TAKE YOU BACK TO THE AUTUMN OF 2008 WHEN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50002 QUESTION ABOUT THE BODY WRONG
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50003 IT WAS TOO UNIFORM
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50004 ONE MORE POINT ABOUT THIS
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50005 SUPPOSE YOU WANT TO USE VIRCHOW'S ANSWER TO WHAT IS IT
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50007 IMAGINE THE LIVES WE COULD SAVE
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50008 SO LET ME START BY DISTINGUISHING TWO KINDS OF QUESTIONS IN THE SCIENCES
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50009 WHAT ARE IT'S BUILDING BLOCKS
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50010 HOW DOES IT WORK
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50011 QUESTIONS ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT MECHANISMS OR PROCESSES
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50012 LIKE IMAGINE THAT YOU HAVE A STRAND OF DNA AND SOME ENZYMES OUT OF WHICH A PROTEIN IS BEING BUILT
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50013 WHAT'S THE PROCESS BY WHICH THAT'S HAPPENING
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50014 QUESTIONS IT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA TO DO A GOOD JOB ANSWERING WHAT IS IT
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50015 QUESTIONS AS WELL
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50016 BUT WHAT IS IT
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50017 WE DON'T REALLY DO THAT
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50018 WHAT IS MONEY
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50019 WHAT IS A COMPANY
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50020 HERE ARE THE RESULTS
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50021 WHY DO THE NATURAL SCIENCES SPEND SO MUCH TIME ADDRESSING THESE QUESTIONS
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50022 SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT WE'RE MADE OF SOME STUFF CALLED PROTOPLASM WHATEVER THAT IS SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50023 VIRCHOW ARGUED FOR THE CELL THEORY OF ORGANISMS AND HERE ARE A COUPLE OF THE PRINCIPLES HE PUT FORWARD
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50024 THE EYE IS AN AMAZING STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL DEVICE AND YET IT'S NOT MADE OUT OF CELLS
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50025 IT'S A BUNCH OF PEOPLE INTERACTING WITH ONE ANOTHER
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50026 AND OF COURSE PHILOSOPHY'S JUST ONE PLACE WHERE THIS NEEDS TO HAPPEN
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50027 THIS IS THE WORKHORSE OF ECONOMIC THEORY IT'S WHAT MACRO ECONOMISTS SPEND MUCH OF THEIR TIME DOING
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50028 THESE MODELS ARE SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLICATED IN TERMS OF THEIR BUILDING BLOCKS THAN THE ONES I JUST SHOWED YOU BUT NOT MUCH MORE
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50029 WHAT'S A COMPANY
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50030 LOOK AROUND YOU RIGHT NOW
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50031 OR LOOK IN YOUR COMPANY
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50032 IT'S A BUNCH OF PEOPLE INTERACTING WITH ONE ANOTHER
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50033 AND THERE'S MORE
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50034 LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO FIX THE SOCIAL SCIENCES BUT BY LARGE THE WAY THEY
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50035 THE STAKES ARE HUGE IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES
trainval/FLbEKpLS5Z0/50036 AND IF WE CAN START MAKING IMPROVEMENTS WE JUST MIGHT FIND THAT AFTER YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS OF EFFORT THAT WE CAN
trainval/FLbXrNGVXfE/50001 SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH YOUR LIFE
trainval/FLbXrNGVXfE/50003 THAT'S HOW THEY MET
trainval/FLbXrNGVXfE/50004 BUT IT DOESN'T MANIFEST IT IN QUITE THE SAME WAY
trainval/fLJsdqxnZb0/50001 I NERVOUSLY PEERED OVER THE SIDE OF THE BED TO SEE WHAT HAD BEFALLEN MY FALLEN SISTER AND SAW THAT SHE HAD LANDED PAINFULLY ON HER
trainval/fLJsdqxnZb0/50002 SO I DID THE ONLY THING MY FRANTIC SEVEN YEAR OLD BRAIN COULD THINK TO DO TO AVERT THIS TRAGEDY
trainval/fLJsdqxnZb0/50003 AND IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN YOU'VE SEEN THIS HUNDREDS OF TIMES
trainval/fLJsdqxnZb0/50004 DID YOU SEE HOW YOU LANDED
trainval/fLJsdqxnZb0/50005 AND WE KNOW THAT'S A MEASUREMENT ERROR BECAUSE IT'S MESSING UP MY DATA
trainval/fLJsdqxnZb0/50006 AND WE TAILOR THE CLASS TOWARDS THE AVERAGE
trainval/fLJsdqxnZb0/50008 WHATEVER IT IS INSTEAD OF DELETING YOU WHAT I WANT TO DO IS STUDY YOU
trainval/fLJsdqxnZb0/50009 EMBEDDED WITHIN THAT QUESTION IS THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING THE SCIENCE OF HAPPINESS
trainval/fLJsdqxnZb0/50011 AND FRIDAY NIGHT WE'RE TRYING TO DECIDE BETWEEN RISKY SEX OR HAPPINESS
trainval/fLJsdqxnZb0/50012 SILENCE ON THE PHONE
trainval/fLJsdqxnZb0/50013 AND INTO THE SILENCE I SAID I'D BE HAPPY TO SPEAK AT YOUR SCHOOL BUT THAT'S NOT A WELLNESS WEEK THAT'S A SICKNESS WEEK
trainval/fLJsdqxnZb0/50014 YOU'VE OUTLINED ALL THE NEGATIVE THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN BUT NOT TALKED ABOUT THE POSITIVE
trainval/fLJsdqxnZb0/50015 THAT UNDERGIRDS MOST OF OUR PARENTING AND MANAGING STYLES THE WAY THAT WE MOTIVATE OUR BEHAVIOR
trainval/fLJsdqxnZb0/50016 YOU GOT GOOD GRADES NOW YOU HAVE TO GET BETTER GRADES YOU GOT INTO A GOOD SCHOOL AND AFTER YOU GET INTO A BETTER ONE YOU GOT A GOOD JOB NOW YOU HAVE
trainval/fLJsdqxnZb0/50017 AND IF HAPPINESS IS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF SUCCESS YOUR BRAIN NEVER GETS THERE
trainval/fLJsdqxnZb0/50018 WE GET PEOPLE WHEN THEY OPEN UP THEIR INBOX TO WRITE ONE POSITIVE EMAIL PRAISING OR THANKING SOMEBODY IN THEIR SUPPORT NETWORK
trainval/fLJsdqxnZb0/50019 AND BY DOING THESE ACTIVITIES AND BY TRAINING YOUR BRAIN JUST LIKE WE TRAIN OUR BODIES WHAT WE'VE FOUND IS WE CAN REVERSE THE FORMULA FOR
trainval/fLJsdqxnZb0/50020 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/fLJsdqxnZb0/50021 AND WE'RE SO EXCITED
trainval/FM5SDGprLpc/50001 OTHERS SAY THAT GRANTING EQUALITY TO THE PALESTINIANS AND ALLOWING THE REFUGEES A RIGHT OF
trainval/FM5SDGprLpc/50002 I'VE LOOKED UP THE TERM SELF DETERMINATION AND AS FAR AS I CAN TELL
trainval/FM5SDGprLpc/50003 WHAT I SAY IS THIS
trainval/fm9SH6NucHk/50001 ARE THERE OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING THIS
trainval/fm9SH6NucHk/50002 HOW CAN WE CONNECT THIS
trainval/fm9SH6NucHk/50003 AND WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING HE STARTED A FEW CONFERENCE CALLS
trainval/FMJgZ4s2E3w/50001 THE OLD SHYNESS WAS A FEAR OF REJECTION
trainval/FMJgZ4s2E3w/50002 IT'S A SOCIAL AWKWARDNESS LIKE YOU'RE A STRANGER IN A FOREIGN LAND
trainval/FMJgZ4s2E3w/50003 DRUGS YOU WANT MORE OF THE SAME DIFFERENT
trainval/FMJgZ4s2E3w/50004 THAT MEANS THEY'RE TOTALLY OUT OF SYNC IN TRADITIONAL CLASSES WHICH ARE ANALOG STATIC INTERACTIVELY PASSIVE
trainval/fmS0sTNcDIo/50001 BUT WHAT'S THE POINT TO BEING SO CONSPICUOUS
trainval/fmxNuVDJZEY/50001 BUT IF YOU DO THE SEARCH FOR THE AMERICAN SPELLING THE NUMBER ONE SEARCH RESULT IS SOME TRENDY IPHONE PHOTO SHARING APP
trainval/fmxNuVDJZEY/50002 AND I FOUND THAT IT CAN GIVE YOU BETTER SEARCH RESULTS
trainval/fmZSIr2Z29s/50001 I WANTED A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM BUILT ON SAFETY
trainval/fmZSIr2Z29s/50002 WATCHING MY BEAUTIFUL HAIR CIRCLE THE BATH TUBE DRAIN IN THE SHOWER BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT WAS GUT
trainval/FN0fjOsJIxk/50001 SO THE CONVERSATION CHANGES
trainval/FN0fjOsJIxk/50002 RESCUING BROWN WOMEN HAS HAD A LONG HISTORY IN WESTERN IMPERIALIST PROJECTS
trainval/FN0fjOsJIxk/50003 HER JAW HIT THE GROUND AND THAT WAS ABOUT IT FROM HER
trainval/FN0fjOsJIxk/50004 AS THE BUS CAME AND MY FRIENDS AND I WERE GETTING READY TO BOARD ON THE BUS I TURNED TO THE WOMEN A BIG SMILE ON MY FACE
trainval/FN0fjOsJIxk/50005 I COULDN'T HELP BUT COMPARE HOW MY STORY WAS REPRESENTED ON TV IN
trainval/FN0fjOsJIxk/50006 HOWEVER AS FEMINISM WAVES ITS IDEAL PICTURE OF THE NON WESTERN WORLD
trainval/FnL7I6tESAs/50001 IT'S MUCH EASIER TO MODEL MATHEMATICALLY OR AT LEAST WE THINK SO
trainval/FnL7I6tESAs/50002 BUT UNFORTUNATELY I'M AN EXPERIMENTALIST WHICH MEANS FOR ME IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO BE PRESENT WHILE IT TAKES PLACE
trainval/FnL7I6tESAs/50003 IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT ANY OF US WILL LIVE FOR LONG ENOUGH FOR THIS TO HAPPEN AGAIN
trainval/FnL7I6tESAs/50004 WHAT HAPPENED WAS IN THAT CASE WE GO FROM A SITUATION WHERE WE STARTED WHERE
trainval/FnL7I6tESAs/50005 IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT'S NOT SO OBVIOUS BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE ONE MOLECULE AT A TIME AND
trainval/FnL7I6tESAs/50006 THIS WAS THE IDEA THAT WE TRIED TO REALIZE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS
trainval/FnL7I6tESAs/50007 THAT IS I'M NOT GOING INTO THE DETAILS OF THAT ONE TODAY BUT IT'S A TRANSITION FROM A NORMAL
trainval/FnL7I6tESAs/50008 IT'S VERY EARLY TO PREDICT WHAT ELSE WE CAN OBSERVE
trainval/fnS9f5x0f1Q/50001 THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH INFORMATION THERE IS ON THE LOCAL FIRE HYDRANT
trainval/fnS9f5x0f1Q/50002 WELL IF YOU'RE BUILDING A BRIDGE DETAILS ARE PRETTY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'LL FALL DOWN IF YOU IGNORE THE DETAILS
trainval/fnS9f5x0f1Q/50003 AND THAT'S SHOWN VERY VERY NICELY IN THE MOVIE
trainval/fnS9f5x0f1Q/50004 IT'S LITERALLY MOVIES IN YOUR HEAD
trainval/fnS9f5x0f1Q/50005 THEY FLASH UP INTO MY MEMORY JUST LIKE GOOGLE FOR PICTURES
trainval/fnS9f5x0f1Q/50006 AND WHERE I WAS BAD WAS ALGEBRA
trainval/fnS9f5x0f1Q/50007 AND I WAS NEVER ALLOWED TO TAKE GEOMETRY OR TRIG
trainval/fnS9f5x0f1Q/50008 THAT'S THE KIND OF SPECIFICITY YOU NEED
trainval/fnS9f5x0f1Q/50009 WELL THAT'S THE END OF MY TALK
trainval/fnS9f5x0f1Q/50011 YEAH I'M A MILLION MILE FLIER
trainval/fnS9f5x0f1Q/50012 YOU COULD HAVE A HORSE THAT'S BEEN ABUSED BY A RIDER
trainval/fnS9f5x0f1Q/50013 AND WHEN THE PILOTS WALK AROUND THE PLANE GUESS WHAT
trainval/fnS9f5x0f1Q/50014 THEY CAN'T SEE THAT STUFF INSIDE THE TAIL
trainval/fnS9f5x0f1Q/50015 I WAS A GOOFBALL STUDENT WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL
trainval/fnS9f5x0f1Q/50016 I MEAN ART WAS MY BEST SUBJECT IN SCHOOL
trainval/fnS9f5x0f1Q/50017 YOU JUST HAVE TO LEARN IT
trainval/fnS9f5x0f1Q/50018 WE NEED TO BE DOING THAT
trainval/fnS9f5x0f1Q/50019 THAT WOULD NOT BE A REASONABLE THING FOR THEM TO DO
trainval/fnS9f5x0f1Q/50020 YOU KNOW THE SLAUGHTER PLANTS I WORKED WITH IN THE 80S THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY AWFUL
trainval/folTvNDL08A/50001 SO I'LL TELL YOU
trainval/folTvNDL08A/50002 THEY WISHED THEY KNEW HOW TO PREVENT THEIR FOOD SUPPLY FROM SOMETIMES
trainval/folTvNDL08A/50003 YOU HAVE YOUR INTERPRETATION
trainval/folTvNDL08A/50005 SO WE PERCEIVE NOTHING AS WHAT IT REALLY IS
trainval/folTvNDL08A/50006 AND PARALLEL UNIVERSES
trainval/folTvNDL08A/50008 AND IT'S ONLY WHEN AN EXPLANATION IS GOOD THAT IT EVEN MATTERS WHETHER IT'S TESTABLE
trainval/Fom14XGMFHA/50001 DR BRUCE LIPTON IN HIS BESTSELLER BIOLOGY OF BELIEF TALKS ABOUT HOW BELIEFS IMPACT US
trainval/Fom14XGMFHA/50002 IT'S PRETTY AWESOME
trainval/Fom14XGMFHA/50003 I WANTED TO SPEAK UP BUT I JUST FELT LIKE I COULDN'T
trainval/Fom14XGMFHA/50004 SHE WORKED IN A BUSINESS BUT PEOPLE HATED WORKING FOR HER
trainval/FPhHHtn8On8/50001 SO ALL I CAN DO IS KEEP REPEATING IT IN DIFFERENT TONES AND HOPE YOU WON'T NOTICE
trainval/FpHPVrsEkYY/50001 ON PAPER THESE COUNTRIES SEEM VERY DIFFERENT
trainval/FpHPVrsEkYY/50002 I THINK I PAID LIKE 15 DOLLARS A MONTH FOR UNLIMITED ACCESS TO TWITTER
trainval/FpHPVrsEkYY/50004 I'S BASICALLY ME IN A ROOM WITH A CAMERA TALKING TO MYSELF ABOUT AFRICA AND HOPING THAT IT MAKES ANY
trainval/FPhZGDS6kVQ/50001 NOW WAS IT BECAUSE THERE WEREN'T ANY ORANGE BALLOONS
trainval/FPhZGDS6kVQ/50002 THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THESE EVERY DAY IN OUR ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DISTINGUISH A GOOD LIFE
trainval/FPhZGDS6kVQ/50003 BECAUSE THINGS TEND TO GET UGLY WHEN THERE'S ONLY ONE MEANING ONE TRUTH ONLY ANSWERS AND NO QUESTIONS
trainval/FPhZGDS6kVQ/50004 BUT WHETHER YOU AGREED WITH THE MOVEMENT'S GOALS OR NOT EVERY GATHERING WAS A BEAUTIFUL LESSON IN RAW
trainval/FPhZGDS6kVQ/50005 THEY HAVE SOMETHING BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
trainval/FPhZGDS6kVQ/50006 WE MUST ACQUIRE AND PROMOTE A NEW AESTHETIC AND SENTIMENTAL EDUCATION
trainval/FQdQhV1yjfc/50001 WE CALL OURSELVES PORS AND RAO AND WE LIVE AND WORK IN INDIA
trainval/FQdQhV1yjfc/50002 I'D LIKE TO BEGIN WITH MY VERY FIRST OBJECT WHICH I CALL THE UNCLE PHONE
trainval/FQdQhV1yjfc/50003 SO WE WORKED WITH A COMPANY THAT SPECIALIZES IN CAMERA SURVEILLANCE AND WE ASKED THEM TO DEVELOP A PIECE OF SOFTWARE WITH US
trainval/fqJAeReFr8I/50001 THESE THREE INNOVATIONS SET IN MOTION THE MOST PROFOUND CHANGES IN HUMAN
trainval/fqJAeReFr8I/50002 AT THE TIME I WAS WORKING AS THE SCIENCE ADVISOR TO THE US SECRETARY OF STATE THEN CONDOLEEZZA RICE
trainval/fqJAeReFr8I/50003 LET'S LOOK AT SOME TRENDS
trainval/FqSVvAxDBRY/50001 SO WHEN YOUR KIDS ARE AFRAID OF SOMETHING SMALL LIKE GOING INTO THAT DARK ROOM TO TURN ON THE LIGHT OR PETTING A FRIENDLY
trainval/FqSVvAxDBRY/50002 RESEARCH BACKS THIS IDEA OF PRAISING EFFORT FOR NEARLY EVERYTHING WE DO IN OUR PARENTING NOT JUST IN BRAVERY
trainval/FqSVvAxDBRY/50003 AND THAT IN GENERAL WE DON'T DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF FOSTERING AUTONOMY IN GIRLS WHICH IS A CRITICAL
trainval/FqSVvAxDBRY/50004 AND THAT IDEA OF MICROBRAVERY
trainval/FqSVvAxDBRY/50005 IT APPLIES TO YOU TOO
trainval/FqSVvAxDBRY/50006 AND WE GET TO DO IT THROUGH THE TINY HUMANS WE'RE RAISING
trainval/FqSVvAxDBRY/50007 WE GET TO PARENT THEM
trainval/FqSVvAxDBRY/50008 ALL OF THIS BRINGS ME AROUND TO THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT I LEARNED FROM THE RESEARCH FROM MY OWN LIFE AND WHAT I
trainval/Fr26scqsIwk/50001 SO I THOUGHT WHAT I WOULD TALK ABOUT IS WHY THAT'S THE CASE AND WHY IT'S TIME TO RE EVALUATE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER ANIMALS
trainval/Fr26scqsIwk/50002 SO HERE'S THE FIRST ONE
trainval/Fr26scqsIwk/50003 THAT'S WHY ANOTHER PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THE LAWS FOCUSED ON CRUELTY TO ANIMALS
trainval/Fr26scqsIwk/50004 HERE IS THE SECOND ONE
trainval/Fr26scqsIwk/50005 DARWIN EXPLAINED THAT YOU ARE ALL A BUNCH OF ANIMALS RIGHT
trainval/Fr26scqsIwk/50006 SOME PEOPLE ARE MORE INTELLIGENT
trainval/Fr26scqsIwk/50007 SO AS WE WRESTLE WITH THIS QUESTION THE LACK OF A COMFORTABLE ANSWER'S PROPELLING THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANIMAL RIGHTS LAW
trainval/FrgzvykPILc/50001 THIS FIRE IS THE SIZE OF WALES
trainval/FRKg49ySnNw/50001 AND OUT FROM BEHIND A TREE COMES THIS HALF CRAZED MAN AND HE BEGINS CHASING YOU AND YOU'RE RUNNING AND YOU'RE
trainval/FRKg49ySnNw/50002 THEY HAD THE LOGIC
trainval/frrZbq2LpwI/50001 WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THIS IS THE TOOLS TO DO THIS ARE FREE
trainval/FrsiPG3Cs08/50002 CAN YOU COVER HIS SHIFT TOMORROW
trainval/FrsiPG3Cs08/50004 HE SAID TO ME IT'S LATE NOTICE SO WE WON'T BE ABLE TO PAY YOU AND HE WALKED OUT
trainval/FrsiPG3Cs08/50005 LET THIS BE A CAUTIONARY TALE FOR YOU
trainval/FrsiPG3Cs08/50006 I WENT TO THE PLACE WHERE HE SLEEPS
trainval/fRu9DbUULHM/50001 BUT DO NOT HURRY THE VOYAGE AT ALL
trainval/fRu9DbUULHM/50002 BUT SHE HAS NOTHING MORE TO GIVE YOU
trainval/FrxDrpi1XNU/50001 THE 2011 ARAB SPRING CAPTURED THE ATTENTION OF THE WORLD
trainval/FrxDrpi1XNU/50002 THEY'D SENT THEM AN INVOICE FOR A SALE BUT THE EGYPTIANS NEVER BOUGHT IT
trainval/FrxDrpi1XNU/50003 AS I SAID IT'S A 5 BILLION INDUSTRY
trainval/FrxDrpi1XNU/50004 IN THE LAST YEAR OR SO THE COMPANY HAS OPENED A SALES OFFICE IN
trainval/FrxDrpi1XNU/50005 THE COMPANY HAS ALSO HIRED A SPOKESPERSON
trainval/FrxDrpi1XNU/50006 THEY'RE ALL BUYING OFF THE SHELF STUFF
trainval/FrxDrpi1XNU/50007 I'VE BEEN STUDYING SURVEILLANCE FOR MORE THAN SIX YEARS
trainval/FrxDrpi1XNU/50008 SO GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE BEEN EMBRACING THIS TECHNOLOGY
trainval/fSErHToV8IU/50001 MAYBE SOME OF YOU HAVE RECEIVED AN EMAIL THAT SAYS SOMETHING LIKE HI I'M A NIGERIAN BANKER
trainval/fSf5wNwS2c0/50001 BUT JUST AS THE INTERNET HAS OPENED UP THE WORLD FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US IT HAS ALSO OPENED UP EACH AND EVERY ONE OF
trainval/FsGu5YTM1NI/50001 AND THIS MISSION HAS A PERSONAL ROOT TO IT
trainval/FsGu5YTM1NI/50002 IT DOES RAIN
trainval/fSmQIWnO3Ag/50001 I REALLY WANTED TO BE FREED FROM RELYING ON SOMEONE
trainval/fSmQIWnO3Ag/50002 I DESPERATELY WANTED TO HELP THE BLIND PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET
trainval/FSNEIwDiCSw/50001 AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT
trainval/FSNEIwDiCSw/50002 ALL OF THOSE ACCIDENTS THAT WOUND UP CREATING THE LIFE NARRATIVE THAT WE INHERITED
trainval/FSNEIwDiCSw/50003 BY THE WAY THIS WAS ALWAYS DONE IN PUBLIC
trainval/FSNEIwDiCSw/50004 THIS WAS NOT A DEVASTATING STROKE BUT IT DID AFFECT HIS SPEAKING AND SO FORTH
trainval/FSNEIwDiCSw/50005 I NEVER CLAIMED THAT
trainval/FSNEIwDiCSw/50006 I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT A PROGRAM I STARTED THERE WHICH FROM MY POINT OF VIEW IS THE PROUDEST THING I DID
trainval/FSNEIwDiCSw/50007 IT WAS ABOUT THEIR ENERGY
trainval/FSNEIwDiCSw/50008 SO HOW DO WE DO THAT
trainval/FSNEIwDiCSw/50009 THE WORST INTERVIEW I EVER DID WILLIAM L
trainval/FSNEIwDiCSw/50010 AND SO I CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF THE LIVING SELF PORTRAIT SERIES
trainval/FSNEIwDiCSw/50011 THEY HAVE TO THINK THAT THEY DID SOMETHING AND THAT THEY WANT TO SHARE IT WITH YOU
trainval/FSNEIwDiCSw/50012 AND I WAS DYING
trainval/FSNEIwDiCSw/50013 AND SHE SAID DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS
trainval/FSNEIwDiCSw/50014 THE USUAL SORT OF THING
trainval/FSNEIwDiCSw/50015 THEY HAVE THEIR PLACE
trainval/FSNEIwDiCSw/50016 I SAID DID JEFFERSON EVER DISAPPOINT YOU
trainval/FSNEIwDiCSw/50017 AN AMAZING WOMAN
trainval/FSNEIwDiCSw/50018 FIRST OF ALL WAS THAT DANCE EVEN THOUGH IT HADN'T BEEN OFFERED TO HER WAS HER LIFE
trainval/fSOupkS4VVo/50001 WE PRODUCE A LOT OF SMELL
trainval/fSOupkS4VVo/50002 AND IT WAS ONLY IN 1959 THAT A GERMAN TEAM AFTER SPENDING 20 YEARS IN
trainval/fSOupkS4VVo/50003 HE BASICALLY WENT THROUGH SYSTEMATICALLY SHOWING THAT ONLY THE MOLECULE IN QUESTION WAS THE ONE THAT
trainval/fSOupkS4VVo/50004 IT WORKS JUST AS WELL UNDERWATER FOR GOLDFISH AND LOBSTERS
trainval/fSOupkS4VVo/50005 AND ALMOST EVERY MAMMAL YOU CAN THINK OF HAS HAD A PHEROMONE IDENTIFIED AND OF COURSE AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF
trainval/fSOupkS4VVo/50006 SO WE KNOW THAT PHEROMONES EXIST RIGHT THE WAY ACROSS THE ANIMAL KINGDOM
trainval/fSOupkS4VVo/50007 WELL THE FIRST THING OF COURSE IS THAT WE'RE MAMMALS AND MAMMALS ARE SMELLY
trainval/fSOupkS4VVo/50008 AS ANY DOG OWNER CAN TELL YOU WE SMELL THEY SMELL
trainval/fSOupkS4VVo/50009 BUT THE REAL REASON WE MIGHT THINK THAT HUMANS HAVE PHEROMONES IS THE CHANGE THAT OCCURS AS WE
trainval/fSOupkS4VVo/50010 AND OF COURSE IT'S PUBERTY
trainval/fSOupkS4VVo/50011 ALONG WITH THE PUBIC HAIR AND THE HAIR IN THE ARMPITS NEW GLANDS START TO SECRETE IN THOSE
trainval/fSOupkS4VVo/50012 NOW THIS IS A VERY ATTRACTIVE IDEA AND THE MOLECULES THEY MENTION SOUND REALLY
trainval/fSOupkS4VVo/50013 NOW SMELL WAS THE HARDEST OF THE SENSES TO CRACK AND THE NOBEL PRIZE AWARDED TO RICHARD AXEL
trainval/fSOupkS4VVo/50014 AND ON THESE NERVES EXPOSED IN THE NOSE TO THE OUTSIDE AIR ARE RECEPTORS AND ODOR
trainval/fSOupkS4VVo/50015 THEY HAVE NO SMELL AT ALL AND IT'S ONLY THE WONDERFUL BACTERIA GROWING ON THE RAINFOREST OF HAIR
trainval/fSOupkS4VVo/50016 WE'RE MAMMALS LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE WHO'S A MAMMAL AND WE PROBABLY DO HAVE THEM
trainval/fSOupkS4VVo/50017 NO MATTER HOW EMBARRASSING WE NEED TO SEARCH AND GO FOR THE FIRST TIME WHERE NO ONE ELSE HAS
trainval/fSOupkS4VVo/50018 IT'S A VERY INTERESTING SECRETION
trainval/fSOupkS4VVo/50019 WHAT BENOIST SCHAAL AND HIS TEAM DEVELOPED WAS A SIMPLE TEST TO INVESTIGATE WHAT THE EFFECT OF
trainval/fSOupkS4VVo/50020 IT'S NOT ABOUT INDIVIDUAL RECOGNITION
trainval/fSOupkS4VVo/50021 ANY MOTHER WILL DO
trainval/fSOupkS4VVo/50023 THERE COULD BE ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT HUMANS ARE DOING WITH PHEROMONES THAT WE SIMPLY DON'T KNOW AT THE MOMENT
trainval/fSOupkS4VVo/50024 WHAT WE NEED TO REMEMBER IS PHEROMONES ARE NOT JUST ABOUT SEX
trainval/fSOupkS4VVo/50025 SO DO GO FORWARD AND DO SEARCH FOR MORE
trainval/fSOupkS4VVo/50026 THERE'S LOTS TO FIND
trainval/fSOupkS4VVo/50027 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/FSS4Kv6MlG0/50001 AND THESE KIDS I JUST LOVED THEM
trainval/FSS4Kv6MlG0/50002 I HADN'T SEEN HER BEFORE
trainval/FSS4Kv6MlG0/50003 I ASKED HER THE QUESTION I ASKED EVERYONE
trainval/FSS4Kv6MlG0/50004 SHE LOOKED AT ME AND SHE SAID AT FIRST I THINK YOU ARE BAD
trainval/FSS4Kv6MlG0/50005 AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE DON'T THINK IT'S PRACTICAL BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T MADE IT AN ACHIEVABLE
trainval/FSS4Kv6MlG0/50006 SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING WE SEE ON THOSE GREETING CARDS ONCE A YEAR
trainval/FSS4Kv6MlG0/50007 WE THINK OF IT AS SOMETHING FOR THE NELSON MANDELAS AND THE MOTHER TERESAS OF THE WORLD BUT WE DON'T
trainval/fSSNmDcLMKA/50001 WE SOLVED OUR CURIOSITY IN THE OBVIOUS WAY WE WAITED UNTIL TWO IN THE MORNING WE JUMPED OVER THE FENCES WE
trainval/fSSNmDcLMKA/50003 AND HOW AND WHY PEOPLE REAPPROPRIATE THESE PLACES
trainval/fSSNmDcLMKA/50004 I DO NOT KNOW WHERE WE ARE GOING
trainval/fSSNmDcLMKA/50005 BUT THIS IS WHAT WE DO WHEN WE ARE YOUNG
trainval/fSSNmDcLMKA/50006 THEY EVENTUALLY CHARGED ME AND 11 OTHER PEOPLE WITH CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT CRIMINAL DAMAGE
trainval/fSSNmDcLMKA/50007 I WOULD ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT THOSE BOUNDARIES THAT ARE BEING DRAWN AROUND YOUR EXISTENCE AND THE WAY THEY ARE CHANGING YOUR
trainval/Ftnb2fpJ664/50001 I AM ONLY THE MESSENGER
trainval/fTosle3h3G8/50001 AND IT'S INVOLVED THE TRANSFORMATION OF MY LIFE FROM ONE CHARACTERIZED BY
trainval/fTosle3h3G8/50002 I ALSO WANTED TO BUILD A BODY OF KNOWLEDGE AROUND MY PROJECT SO THAT I COULD LEARN HOW TO REPAIR OR EVEN MAKE SOME OF THE
trainval/fTosle3h3G8/50003 AND FOR ME THIS WAS OVERWHELMING AND DEPRESSING AND PARALYZING
trainval/fTosle3h3G8/50004 AND I'VE REALLY FALLEN IN LINE WITH THIS REALLY WELL ALL MY LIFE
trainval/fTosle3h3G8/50005 A GOOD METAPHOR FOR THIS AND ACTUALLY SOMETHING I WAS EXPERIENCING LITERALLY AT THE TIME IS A SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA BECAUSE
trainval/Ftow7dSpaiY/50001 WE DISGUISED THE DOMESTIC AND PART TIME NATURE OF THE STAFF BY OFFERING FIXED
trainval/Ftow7dSpaiY/50002 OUR PROGRAMMERS REMEMBER ONLY WOMEN INCLUDING GAY AND
trainval/Ftow7dSpaiY/50003 I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD CLUTCHING THE HAND OF MY NINE YEAR OLD SISTER AND HAD VERY LITTLE IDEA AS TO
trainval/Ftow7dSpaiY/50004 BECAUSE WHENEVER I FOUND A GAP IN SERVICES I TRIED TO HELP
trainval/FTUpFYo0rMI/50001 I WAS EXCITED
trainval/FTUpFYo0rMI/50002 STAFF WERE EXCITED
trainval/FTUpFYo0rMI/50003 OFFICERS WERE EXCITED
trainval/FTUpFYo0rMI/50005 THEY WERE INSPIRED
trainval/FTUpFYo0rMI/50006 EVERYBODY WANTED TO BE PART OF THIS
trainval/FTUpFYo0rMI/50007 THEY WERE MAKING A CONTRIBUTION A DIFFERENCE ONE THEY THOUGHT WAS MEANINGFUL AND IMPORTANT
trainval/FTUpFYo0rMI/50008 AND THEY'RE HERE FOR A REASON
trainval/FTUpFYo0rMI/50009 I DON'T SEE MY JOB AS TO PUNISH THEM OR FORGIVE THEM BUT I DO THINK THEY CAN HAVE DECENT AND MEANINGFUL LIVES
trainval/FTUpFYo0rMI/50010 SO THAT WAS THE QUESTION
trainval/FTUpFYo0rMI/50012 EVENTUALLY I DECIDED IF I WAS GOING TO END UP IN PRISON I'D BETTER END UP ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BARS SO I THOUGHT I'D CHECK IT OUT TAKE A TOUR OF
trainval/FTUpFYo0rMI/50013 DISTURBANCES DIED DOWN IN THE GENERAL POPULATION
trainval/FTUpFYo0rMI/50014 THEY WERE PATIENT WITH ME
trainval/FTUpFYo0rMI/50015 OUT OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS GREW SOME NEW IDEAS AND WE STARTED SOME SMALL EXPERIMENTS
trainval/FTUpFYo0rMI/50016 WE TRAINED THE INMATES ON THOSE SAME SKILLS
trainval/FTUpFYo0rMI/50017 NO ONE HAD EVER HEARD OF A CELL WITHOUT A TOILET
trainval/FTUpFYo0rMI/50018 EVEN EIGHT MEN TO A CELL HAD A TOILET
trainval/FTUpFYo0rMI/50019 NOW MANY THINGS WORK AGAINST SYSTEM CHANGE
trainval/FTUpFYo0rMI/50020 SYSTEM CHANGE IS DIFFICULT AND SLOW AND OFTENTIMES IT DOESN'T TAKE YOU WHERE YOU WANT TO GO
trainval/FTUpFYo0rMI/50021 I INTERACTED WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT LIKE ME PEOPLE WHO HAD DIFFERENT IDEAS AND CAME FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS
trainval/FTUpFYo0rMI/50022 FROGS BUTTERFLIES ENDANGERED PRAIRIE PLANTS
trainval/FTUpFYo0rMI/50023 BUT THEN WE STARTED TO REALIZE THAT IF ANY INMATES NEEDED PROGRAMMING IT WAS THESE PARTICULAR INMATES
trainval/FTUpFYo0rMI/50024 BUT PRISONS CAN DO SOME THINGS WE NEVER THOUGHT THEY COULD DO
trainval/FTUpFYo0rMI/50025 OUR STRATEGY IS NOT MASSIVE SYSTEM CHANGE
trainval/ftWn4QOvTTo/50001 BUT IT'S NOT ONLY WATER WHICH IS THE PROBLEM
trainval/ftWn4QOvTTo/50002 LIKE MANY OTHERS AT THE SAME TIME WE CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF SOURCE SEPARATION
trainval/ftWn4QOvTTo/50003 AND WE CAN EXTRACT RESOURCES
trainval/fTznEIZRkLg/50001 I'M A VERY SERIOUS POSSIBILIST
trainval/fTznEIZRkLg/50002 IT CAN BE DONE
trainval/FuahzV12mi0/50001 IF YOUR GENETICS IS THE HARDWARE YOUR EPIGENETICS IS THE SOFTWARE OR THE OPERATING
trainval/FuahzV12mi0/50002 MOM'S CUDDLING THEM ALL THE TIME TYING THEIR SHOES DRIVING THEM TO SOCCER PRACTICE EVERY DAY
trainval/FuSkBWSKSms/50001 IT KNOWS HOW MUCH IT'S MOVING
trainval/FuSkBWSKSms/50002 I ACTUALLY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT MY ROBOT IS GOING TO DO TODAY
trainval/FuSkBWSKSms/50003 SO IF WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE ROBOTS THAT CAN BE MORE EXPRESSIVE AND THAT CAN CONNECT BETTER WITH US IN SOCIETY
trainval/fv8KpQY0m6o/50001 OUR MANUFACTURING OUTPUT IS ACTUALLY SIX TIMES GREATER NOW THAN IT WAS IN THE 1950S
trainval/fv8KpQY0m6o/50002 THE 60S AND THE 70S CHANGED THAT WITH THE YOUTH MOVEMENT
trainval/fv8KpQY0m6o/50003 THOSE ARE TRUTHS UNDERLYING THEM
trainval/fv8KpQY0m6o/50004 NOW IT'S 27 FOR WOMEN AND 29 FOR MEN AND IT IS STILL RISING
trainval/fv8KpQY0m6o/50005 AND THEIR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS CAN'T HELP BUT LOOK AT THE PROGRESS OR LACK OF IT OF THEIR
trainval/fv8KpQY0m6o/50006 IT DOESN'T MEAN THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEM
trainval/fv8KpQY0m6o/50007 AND SO HAVING THIS LIFE STAGE OF EMERGING ADULTHOOD ALLOWS BOTH YOUNG MEN AND YOUNG WOMEN TO
trainval/fv8KpQY0m6o/50008 BECAUSE LATER IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT WHEN YOU'VE MADE THOSE COMMITMENTS
trainval/fv8KpQY0m6o/50009 IT TAKES LONGER TO PREPARE YOURSELF FOR THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY THAN IT DID FOR A MANUFACTURING
trainval/fv8KpQY0m6o/50010 AND EVENTUALLY PEOPLE WILL DEPEND ON YOU
trainval/fv8KpQY0m6o/50011 THAT WILL NARROW THE RANGE OF YOUR CHOICES
trainval/fv8KpQY0m6o/50012 ADULTHOOD WILL STILL BE READY WHEN YOU ARE
trainval/fv8KpQY0m6o/50013 AND A LOT OF WELL MEANING PEOPLE WANT YOU TO GET THERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
trainval/fv8KpQY0m6o/50014 BUT IT'S NOT THEIR LIFE
trainval/fv8KpQY0m6o/50015 BUT THAT IS NOT A BAD THING
trainval/fv8KpQY0m6o/50016 I THINK FEW OF US WOULD VIEW THAT AS A NEGATIVE DEVELOPMENT
trainval/fv8KpQY0m6o/50017 IT'S A GOOD THING
trainval/fVLJU45SnLY/50001 YOU KNOW WHO TO ARREST WHO TO NEGOTIATE WITH
trainval/fVLJU45SnLY/50003 YOU CANNOT TAX THEM
trainval/fVLJU45SnLY/50005 SO AS A RESULT OF IT YOU HAVE THIS VERY STRANGE SITUATION IN WHICH THE ELITES BASICALLY GOT
trainval/fVLJU45SnLY/50006 I'M SAYING THIS BECAUSE ONE OF MY MAJOR POINTS IS WHAT WENT RIGHT IS ALSO WHAT
trainval/fVLJU45SnLY/50007 SO THIS IS NOT BY ACCIDENT THAT THE VOTERS ARE NOT INTERESTED TO VOTE ANYMORE
trainval/fVLJU45SnLY/50008 AND BY THE WAY MISTRUST WAS ALWAYS VERY IMPORTANT FOR DEMOCRACY
trainval/fVLJU45SnLY/50009 THIS IS WHY BASICALLY YOU HAVE ALL THIS CREATIVE MISTRUST BETWEEN THE REPRESENTATIVES AND THOSE WHOM
trainval/fVLJU45SnLY/50010 SO I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO THE PRIME MINISTER WHY HE MADE THIS DECISION
trainval/fVLJU45SnLY/50011 AND THIS IS GOETHE WHO IS NEITHER BULGARIAN NOR A POLITICAL SCIENTIST SOME CENTURIES AGO HE
trainval/fvoWoMIwrSg/50001 NOT EVEN BEYONC MADE THE CUT TO BE AN A GIRL
trainval/fvoWoMIwrSg/50002 SO I FELT BETRAYED
trainval/fvoWoMIwrSg/50003 I COME ACROSS THE CASTING CALL
trainval/fvoWoMIwrSg/50004 AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO PASSIVELY ACCEPT WHAT SOCIETY TELLS US TO THINK IS BEAUTIFUL
trainval/FVSc2FnPnDE/50001 HE WAS BRINGING PEACE TO A DIVIDED AND VIOLENT SOUTH AFRICA ONE MAN
trainval/FVSc2FnPnDE/50002 THROUGH THIS ACT OF IMMENSE OPEN HEARTEDNESS HE WAS TO BECOME THE EMBODIMENT OF WHAT IN SOUTH
trainval/FVSc2FnPnDE/50003 HE FIXED ROADS HE MENDED WETLANDS HE DID SOME ANTI POACHING
trainval/FVSc2FnPnDE/50004 WE WORKED TOGETHER AS A TEAM
trainval/FVSc2FnPnDE/50005 IT GOES TO BITE ME A SECOND TIME
trainval/FVSc2FnPnDE/50007 ACHIEVEMENT IS SHARED
trainval/FVSc2FnPnDE/50008 AND THEN I MET THIS YOUNG LADY
trainval/FVSc2FnPnDE/50009 AND YET STILL I REMAINED AMAZED THAT SHE WAS SURVIVING
trainval/fw01Sq0cxM8/50001 THERE'S SUN BEATING DOWN THERE'S CONCRETE AND GLASS ALL AROUND YOU
trainval/fw01Sq0cxM8/50002 SO THIS POSES REALLY BIG CHALLENGES FOR US
trainval/fw01Sq0cxM8/50003 ALL OF THAT WILL TAKE TIME
trainval/fw01Sq0cxM8/50004 SOME OF IT WILL BE IN OUR ATMOSPHERE FOR A CENTURY MAYBE MUCH LONGER
trainval/fw01Sq0cxM8/50005 BECAUSE IN THE MEANTIME EMISSIONS WILL HAVE ACCUMULATED
trainval/fW6AndSUByo/50001 I THINK MORE POWERFUL THAN THE SEX DRIVE
trainval/fW6AndSUByo/50002 IT'S A DRIVE IT'S A BASIC MATING DRIVE
trainval/fW6AndSUByo/50003 SO I BEGAN TO DECIDE THAT I WOULD STUDY PERSONALITY
trainval/fW6AndSUByo/50004 THERE ARE TWO BASIC ASPECTS OF PERSONALITY OF COURSE WITH EPIGENETICS NOW WE KNOW THAT
trainval/fW6AndSUByo/50005 COM THE SITE THAT I STARTED WITH MATCH
trainval/fW6AndSUByo/50006 IT'S ALL ANONYMOUS BUT ANYWAY I STUDY THE NUMBERS
trainval/fW6AndSUByo/50007 SO I'M GOING TO GO VERY RAPIDLY THROUGH THESE FOUR BROAD STYLES OF THINKING AND BEHAVING THROUGH THE
trainval/fW6AndSUByo/50008 CREATIVITY SEEMS TO BE LINKED WITH THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM IN THE BRAIN
trainval/fW6AndSUByo/50009 AS A MATTER OF FACT I HAVE A FRIEND WHO GOES ANNUALLY TO HIS ACCOUNTANT WITH HIS WIFE AND ABOUT 10 YEARS
trainval/fW6AndSUByo/50010 MUST HAVE THEM
trainval/fW6AndSUByo/50012 I DID A STUDY OF HALF A MILLION PEOPLE
trainval/fW6AndSUByo/50013 I CALL THEM THAT BECAUSE I WAS WORKING WITH A DATING SITE I NEEDED TO NAME THESE PEOPLE
trainval/fW6AndSUByo/50014 I WENT WE TALKED TO JOURNALISTS FOR A WEEK AND THEN CAME THE FINAL NIGHT
trainval/FwFqvOFefqg/50001 OF COURSE MY LADIES CAME TO THE RESCUE BY SAYING
trainval/FwFqvOFefqg/50002 BUT IT REFLECTS ON HOW WE FEEL ABOUT THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY
trainval/FwFqvOFefqg/50003 I COULDN'T FIND A FEMALE MECHANIC SO I BECAME ONE
trainval/FwFqvOFefqg/50004 I WAS REALLY UNFOCUSED AT WORK THINKING ABOUT WHAT I'M GOING TO DO ON MY LUNCH BREAK
trainval/FwFqvOFefqg/50005 SO THAT MEANS THERE ARE MORE WOMEN DRIVERS THAN MEN
trainval/FwFqvOFefqg/50007 THEY CHALLENGED ME WITH QUESTIONS TO TEST MY CAR KNOWLEDGE
trainval/FwFqvOFefqg/50008 AND MY PERSONAL FAVORITE
trainval/FwFqvOFefqg/50009 SO FOR EXAMPLE ONE TITLE IS
trainval/FwFqvOFefqg/50010 DOES YOUR CAR HAVE BOOGIES
trainval/FwFqvOFefqg/50011 I WANT WOMEN TO OWN THEIR CARS AND OWNING IT MEANS KNOWING IT
trainval/fWInyaMWBY8/50001 ITS CHANGES WILL AFFECT ALL OF HUMANITY
trainval/fWInyaMWBY8/50002 WE OWE IT TO OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN
trainval/FwLeiY5f7sI/50001 SHE DECIDED THAT SHE WAS GOING TO GIVE ONLINE DATING A TRY
trainval/FwLeiY5f7sI/50002 YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING
trainval/fwm3azuoLr4/50001 BUT IT WASN'T THAT TIME
trainval/fwm3azuoLr4/50002 YOU BECOME A MEMBER OF A GROUP THAT HAS TRULY SURVIVED
trainval/fwm3azuoLr4/50003 YOU COULD HAVE LIVED WITH US
trainval/fwm3azuoLr4/50004 SO I QUIETLY LIVED IN MY CAR IN MY SHAME AND THEN LIVED IN MY SHAME FOR YEARS
trainval/fwm3azuoLr4/50005 YOU MIGHT WONDER WHAT I DID ONCE I ESCAPED
trainval/fwm3azuoLr4/50006 REGARDLESS WHEN WE REVEAL OUR AUTHENTIC SELVES WE CREATE A TRUSTING WORLD A WORLD WHERE IT FEELS
trainval/fwm3azuoLr4/50007 WE HELP VICTIMS BECOME SURVIVORS AND OUR COMMUNITY CAN RESPOND TO OUR NEEDS IN A PROFOUND
trainval/fwm3azuoLr4/50008 I WAS TRYING TO ESCAPE HIM AND HERE HE WAS LAUGHING AT MY STUPIDITY SHOUTING OBSCENITIES AT
trainval/fwm3azuoLr4/50009 SO I DID IT
trainval/fwm3azuoLr4/50010 THAT WAS MY FIRST MOMENT OF AUTHENTICITY ABOUT MY PAST
trainval/fwm3azuoLr4/50011 I WAS A WORK IN PROGRESS NOT TO BE HELD TO THE TIMELINE OF SOMEONE ELSE'S ACCOMPLISHMENT
trainval/fwm3azuoLr4/50012 WHAT HAPPENED AFTER MY SPEECH THAT DAY WAS THE ONES LIKE ME CAME OUT OF THE WOODWORK
trainval/fwm3azuoLr4/50013 SEE IT'S THAT YOU'RE LIKE ME MOMENT A MOMENT OF CONNECTION OF EMPATHY OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF A
trainval/fwm3azuoLr4/50014 WHAT I REALIZED WAS THAT DENYING THE DARK PARTS OF MY HISTORY I WAS SUPPRESSING A PART OF ME THAT MATTERED AND A PART THAT
trainval/fwm3azuoLr4/50015 THINK ABOUT THAT
trainval/FX6j9jPF8Ss/50001 AND FOR SOME REASON HE WAS LIKE SURE WHY NOT
trainval/fXf3CCyhLGU/50001 WHAT MADE A DIFFERENCE FOR THE ABECEDARIAN CHILDREN
trainval/fXf3CCyhLGU/50002 WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR
trainval/FXYFLK0KZio/50001 WE ALWAYS FEEL THAT WHATEVER WE DO OR WHATEVER RISKS WE TAKE OR WHATEVER SIDE WAY WE TAKE FROM THE KPI
trainval/FXYFLK0KZio/50002 IT'S LIKE WATER
trainval/FyL9OkVgZA4/50001 THEY FORGOT THAT THE ROOTS OF MODERN CIVILIZATION WAS IN MESOPOTAMIA
trainval/FyL9OkVgZA4/50002 I REMEMBER PLAYING KICKBALL FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF TIMES
trainval/FyL9OkVgZA4/50003 I BEGAN GETTING USED TO WORKING ALONE
trainval/FyL9OkVgZA4/50004 I WONDER WHERE TAKING RISKS WILL TAKE YOU ALL
trainval/FyL9OkVgZA4/50005 AFTER PAYING THEM MY PARENTS NEVER FELT THE SAME ABOUT LIVING IN IRAQ
trainval/fYUaWgVF2XA/50001 THEY'VE TAKEN THINGS OFF THE SHELF
trainval/fYUaWgVF2XA/50002 ONE OF MY FAVORITE EXAMPLES IS THAT OF SIR HAROLD RIDLEY WHO WAS A
trainval/fYUaWgVF2XA/50003 WHATEVER LIFE THROWS AT US WHETHER IT'S CANCER DIABETES HEART DISEASE OR EVEN BROKEN BONES WE
trainval/fYUaWgVF2XA/50004 WE'RE ACTUALLY ACTIVELY LOOKING FOR MATERIALS THAT WILL BE BIOACTIVE THAT WILL INTERACT WITH THE BODY AND THAT
trainval/fYUaWgVF2XA/50005 AND ACTUALLY WE KNOW THAT THOSE CELLS IN THE BODY IN THE EMBRYO AS THEY DEVELOP CAN FORM A DIFFERENT KIND OF
trainval/fYUaWgVF2XA/50006 BUT WE WANT TO MAKE THEM HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION THAT WE CAN GET THE CELLS TO DO WHAT WE WANT BUT NOT BE SO
trainval/FzApYQDIXlg/50001 BY THE WAY PARENTHETICALLY IT IS OBVIOUS IN THE US CASE
trainval/FzApYQDIXlg/50002 NOW WHAT HAPPENS USUALLY BETWEEN STAGE ONE LT BR GT AND STAGE TWO OF A REVOLUTION
trainval/FzApYQDIXlg/50004 SO DEMOCRACY CAN ADAPT ADJUST AND BE MOVED FROM PLACE TO PLACE LT BR GT AND CAN BE MADE TO BE RECONCILED WITH DIFFERENT WORLD
trainval/FzApYQDIXlg/50005 THEY ARE GOOD AT GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION
trainval/FzApYQDIXlg/50006 THEY HAVE IDEAS THAT CARRY CHARISMA AND THEY HAVE ABOVE ALL ELSE THE IDEA OF ISLAM WHICH IS A
trainval/FzAyOddR5u4/50001 I SAID DADA READ THIS
trainval/FzAyOddR5u4/50003 STAND IN LINE
trainval/FzAyOddR5u4/50004 DON'T CROSS THE LINE
trainval/FzAyOddR5u4/50005 THERE WERE SO MANY RULES AROUND WHAT WE HAD TO DO THAT THE CULTURE CONSTRAINED ME LIKE A CORSET
trainval/FzAyOddR5u4/50006 I THINK THEY LET ME IN BY ACCIDENT
trainval/FzAyOddR5u4/50007 THE ENGINEERING TAUGHT ME HOW TO BUILD PRODUCTS AND HOW HARD IT IS TO BUILD PRODUCTS
trainval/FzAyOddR5u4/50008 I GOT TO WORK ON THE FIRST CONSUMER FACING DIGITAL CAMERA AND NOW WE CAN CAPTURE ALL THE SMILES
trainval/FzAyOddR5u4/50009 WHAT IF WE COULD FIND A SOLUTION BETWEEN FUNDING AND DEFUNDING AN ORGANIZATION THAT HELPS WOMEN'S HEALTH
trainval/FzAyOddR5u4/50010 BUILD IT ANYWAY
trainval/FzAyOddR5u4/50011 WE'LL FORCE THEM TO DO IT
trainval/FzAyOddR5u4/50012 THE REST WAS UP TO HIM
trainval/FzAyOddR5u4/50013 SO WE WERE WORKING WITH A MANUFACTURER PROBABLY THE ONE YOU HAD IN YOUR HOME BECAUSE THEY KNEW PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO
trainval/FzAyOddR5u4/50014 BUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH ALL THESE IDEAS
trainval/FzAyOddR5u4/50015 WILL IT IMPROVE THE WORLD
trainval/FzAyOddR5u4/50016 WILL IT CHANGE THE WAY PEOPLE INTERACT
trainval/FzAyOddR5u4/50017 WE CALL THIS FUNNEL VISION AND IT GETS YOU TO THAT SET THAT YOU CAN START WORKING FROM
trainval/FzAyOddR5u4/50018 I'M TALKING ABOUT GETTING FROM CAN'T TO CAN TO COME UP WITH THE IDEAS IN THE FIRST PLACE SO YOU DON'T FEEL
trainval/FzAyOddR5u4/50019 SOME OF YOU UNDERSTAND THE TECHNIQUE I CAN ASK WHAT IF
trainval/FzAyOddR5u4/50020 AND YOU'LL DO IT
trainval/FzAyOddR5u4/50021 PEOPLE WOULD NEVER USE THAT
trainval/FzAyOddR5u4/50022 THAT WOULD COST TOO MUCH MONEY
trainval/fzKxYlHmhmY/50001 SO THIS IS IT JUST FOLLOW NOW
trainval/fzKxYlHmhmY/50002 IF YOU OPERATE UPON IT AT A SMALLER SIZE THE RISK WITH THE OPERATION
trainval/fzKxYlHmhmY/50003 AND THE VARIATION IS 480
trainval/fzKxYlHmhmY/50004 IN 1949 ANTONIO MONIZ GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR AN
trainval/fzKxYlHmhmY/50005 I WANT YOU TO THINK
trainval/FzmXULKUNJU/50001 LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT MY OWN BLIND SPOT
trainval/FzmXULKUNJU/50002 I ALMOST LOST SIGHT OF MY OWN POWER
trainval/FzmXULKUNJU/50003 FOR MY FAMILY SOCIAL CONNECTIONS WERE KEY TO MOVING FROM POVERTY TOWARDS
trainval/FzmXULKUNJU/50004 FAMILY INDEPENDENCE INITIATIVE IS A PLATFORM
trainval/FzmXULKUNJU/50005 BRIANNA WAS STRUGGLING IN SCHOOL
trainval/G0jxiJzIiz4/50001 BY BREAKING OUTSIDE OF OUR FRIENDS LIST WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONNECT WITH SOCIAL GROUPS OF ANY SIZE
trainval/G0jxiJzIiz4/50002 EACH TIME THAT I PLAYED I WOULD LEARN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THEM
trainval/G0jxiJzIiz4/50003 BUT THERE IS ANOTHER WAY
trainval/G0jxiJzIiz4/50004 IT IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL AND WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT IT
trainval/G0ZjSInJ4BQ/50001 ONLY ABOUT ONE IN 10 GETS THE EIGHT TO 10 HOURS OF SLEEP PER NIGHT RECOMMENDED BY SLEEP
trainval/G0ZjSInJ4BQ/50002 NOT HORMONES SOCIAL LIVES OR SNAPCHAT
trainval/G0ZjSInJ4BQ/50003 THIS IS DRIVEN IN PART BY A SHIFT IN THE RELEASE OF THE HORMONE MELATONIN
trainval/G0ZjSInJ4BQ/50004 SO ESSENTIALLY WE'VE GOT AN ENTIRE POPULATION OF TIRED BUT
trainval/G0ZjSInJ4BQ/50005 WITH A TRULY OUTSTANDING ONE
trainval/G0ZjSInJ4BQ/50006 THEIR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH IMPROVES AND EVEN THEIR FAMILIES ARE HAPPIER
trainval/G0ZjSInJ4BQ/50007 I MEAN WHO WOULDN'T ENJOY A LITTLE MORE PLEASANTNESS FROM OUR TEENS AND A LITTLE LESS
trainval/g1bOpgoOI3g/50001 I MEAN REAL SUPERPOWERS
trainval/G1Ke6JIZyX4/50001 I'VE SEEN FRIENDS CRUMBLE UNDER THE PRESSURES OF NOT DOING WELL ON A TEST AT A MATH COMPETITION
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50001 BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WHAT IS THE MAIN ISSUE THAT IS HOLDING EVERYBODY BACK FROM
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50002 IT PROVIDES MOTIVATION AND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR IMMERSION
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50003 BUT IT'S NOT THE ANSWER TO ALL OF YOUR PROBLEMS
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50004 IF YOU GO TO THE COUNTRY AND YOU DON'T YET SPEAK THE LANGUAGE WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50005 ARE YOU GOING TO RELY ON OTHER EXPATS AND LOCALS WHO SPEAK ENGLISH TO HELP YOU TO GET BY
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50006 SO WE KNOW AN EXTREME EXAMPLE
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50007 IT'S ONLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT REACHING NATIVE LIKE LEVELS OF PRONUNCIATION AND GRAMMAR WHERE CHILDREN START TO SHOW AN UPPER HAND
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50008 HOWEVER IF YOU WERE TO PUSH THROUGH THIS ZONE AND GET TO THE SECOND ZONE SUDDENLY SWIMMING BECOMES A LOT
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50009 WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50010 AND HOW DO YOU SAY THIS
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50011 THAT'S MOST OF YOU HERE
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50012 AND WE FOUND THAT THIS NO ENGLISH RULE WORKED INCREDIBLY WELL
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50013 AS A MATTER OF FACT NEAR THE END OF OUR TRAVELS IN EACH COUNTRY WE WERE CONFIDENTLY ABLE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50014 SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE A SHORT VIDEO THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU THAT CAPTURES THE KIND OF PROGRESS THAT WE WERE ABLE
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50015 AND AFTER A YEAR OF LIVING IN FRANCE AND PUSHING MYSELF TO STUDY EVERY SINGLE DAY I DID GET TO A POINT WHERE I
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50016 AND CONTRAST THAT TO THAT OF MY MORE RECENT EXPERIENCE IN SPAIN
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50017 AND THAT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50018 ACTUALLY MAKING MISTAKES IS VERY GOOD BECAUSE IT MEANS YOU'RE USING THE LANGUAGE AND EVENTUALLY IT HELPS YOU TO GAIN THE
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50019 AND IN CHINA AND IN KOREA BECAUSE CHINESE AND KOREAN ARE SO MUCH HARDER THAN THE EUROPEAN LANGUAGES
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50020 SO REMEMBER THAT THE WHOLE GOAL OF THIS PROCESS AND THIS METHOD IS TO PUSH PAST THIS ZONE OF
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50021 IDEALLY THE WAY YOU'D DO THIS IS YOU'D MOVE TO THE COUNTRY THAT SPEAKS THIS LANGUAGE AND GO
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50022 BUT I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE BEAUTY OF THE NO ENGLISH RULE IS THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50023 IF YOU'RE TRYING TO LEARN SPANISH AND YOU HAVE A CO WORKER OR COLLEAGUE THAT SPEAKS SPANISH
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50024 SO EVERY TIME YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THEM YOU ONLY COMMIT TO SPEAKING IN SPANISH
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50025 SO IF YOU WERE TO BUMP IN THEM AT THE WATER COOLER AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SMALL TALK AND YOU WANT TO SAY LET'S SAY YOU WERE BUSY AT WORK
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50026 AND WHAT THIS REALLY HELPS YOU TO DO IS THAT IT HELPS YOU OUT WITH TWO REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50027 THE FIRST ONE
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50028 EVERY TIME I SEE THIS PERSON I KNOW IT IS PRACTICE TIME THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT NOW I HAVE TO SPEAK SPANISH
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50029 COMMIT TO THE NO ENGLISH RULE WITH THIS PERSON
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50030 TELL THEM THAT YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE NOT TOO GREAT AT THE LANGUAGE YET YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO USE GOOGLE TRANSLATOR AND DICTIONARY A LOT IN
trainval/G1RRbupCxi0/50031 ONCE AGAIN IT IS NOT SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO BE PERFECT AT
trainval/g2J6YOiLNr4/50001 THESE THINGS REALLY INTERESTED ME
trainval/g2J6YOiLNr4/50002 I HAD BEEN STEEPED IN THE INTELLIGENCE ON IRAQ AND ITS WMD AND MY TESTIMONY TO
trainval/g2J6YOiLNr4/50003 AND HE GOES YOU KNOW I JUST CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE
trainval/g2J6YOiLNr4/50004 I WANTED TO BE AN AMBASSADOR AND MY MENTORS MY HEROES PEOPLE WHO GOT TO THE TOP OF MY PROFESSION AND HERE I
trainval/g2J6YOiLNr4/50005 18 PEOPLE WERE KILLED
trainval/g2J6YOiLNr4/50006 IT WAS ANARCHY
trainval/g2J6YOiLNr4/50007 I WENT THROUGH THOSE MOBS
trainval/g2J6YOiLNr4/50008 AND IT WAS LIKE THAT FOR ME
trainval/g2J6YOiLNr4/50009 AND FUNNILY ENOUGH THEY WERE FRUSTRATED ABOUT THAT
trainval/g2J6YOiLNr4/50011 WHY DON'T YOU ADVISE THEIR GOVERNMENT ON THEIR DIPLOMACY
trainval/g2J6YOiLNr4/50012 AND SO THAT WAS THE IDEA
trainval/g2J6YOiLNr4/50013 I KNOW THIS STUFF
trainval/g2J6YOiLNr4/50014 IT'S WHAT I DO
trainval/g2J6YOiLNr4/50015 AT THAT TIME THERE WAS JUST ME AND ME AND MY WIFE WERE MOVING BACK TO NEW YORK
trainval/g2J6YOiLNr4/50016 IN NEW YORK WHEN I STARTED INDEPENDENT DIPLOMAT
trainval/g2J6YOiLNr4/50017 AND I STARTED TO FALL
trainval/g2J6YOiLNr4/50018 THOSE OTHER THINGS ARE CALLED NON STATE ACTORS
trainval/g2J6YOiLNr4/50019 WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO EMBRACE THAT REALITY
trainval/g2J6YOiLNr4/50020 THAT IS THE STATE OF THE WORLD TODAY
trainval/g2J6YOiLNr4/50021 WE WENT AROUND 70 U
trainval/g2J6YOiLNr4/50024 EVERYBODY WENT YES OF COURSE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
trainval/g2J6YOiLNr4/50025 SECURITY COUNCIL AND FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE U
trainval/g2J6YOiLNr4/50026 SECURITY COUNCIL TO EXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT THEY WANT
trainval/g2J6YOiLNr4/50027 AND INDEPENDENT DIPLOMAT IS A KIND OF EXAMPLE OF THIS IN A SORT OF LOOSE WAY
trainval/g2m97gPI70I/50001 I WASN'T WEIGHED DOWN BY EXPERTISE OR CONVENTIONAL WISDOM
trainval/g2m97gPI70I/50002 AND TURN IT INTO A RHYTHM AND PLACE IT WITH THE LIPS I READ
trainval/G2Y6Am46eVU/50001 AND THAT WAS WHAT'S THE ONE PIECE OF ADVICE YOU WOULD GIVE TO MY GIRLS
trainval/G2Y6Am46eVU/50002 I WAS HIT BY A PASSING SEDAN
trainval/G2Y6Am46eVU/50003 I'M BRUCE I SAID AND PROMPTLY PASSED OUT
trainval/G2Y6Am46eVU/50004 I BROKE MY LEFT FEMUR THAT DAY IT'S THE LARGEST BONE IN YOUR BODY AND SPENT THE NEXT TWO MONTHS IN A BODY
trainval/G2Y6Am46eVU/50005 AND MY DOCTOR ON A WHIM SENT ME TO GET A FULL BODY BONE SCAN WHICH SHOWED THAT THERE WAS SOME GROWTH IN MY LEFT LEG
trainval/G2Y6Am46eVU/50006 THAT SENT ME TO AN X RAY THEN TO AN MRI
trainval/G2Y6Am46eVU/50007 I WOULD REACH OUT TO SIX MEN FROM ALL PARTS OF MY LIFE AND ASK THEM TO BE PRESENT IN THE PASSAGES OF MY
trainval/G2Y6Am46eVU/50009 I SAID LOOK IN GEORGIA AT LEAST WE WANT TO KNOW
trainval/G2Y6Am46eVU/50010 THAT'S WHY THEY WERE CALLED APE HANGERS
trainval/G2Y6Am46eVU/50011 WE KIND OF WENT THROUGH MY PERSONALITY AND TRIED TO GET A DAD WHO REPRESENTED EACH DIFFERENT THING
trainval/G2Y6Am46eVU/50012 SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS I WROTE A LETTER TO EACH OF THESE MEN
trainval/G2Y6Am46eVU/50014 SO A FEW WEEKS AFTER MY DIAGNOSIS WE WENT UP TO VERMONT AND I DECIDED TO PUT JEFF AS THE FIRST PERSON IN THE
trainval/G2Y6Am46eVU/50015 AND WE WENT TO THIS APPLE ORCHARD AND I READ HIM THIS LETTER
trainval/G2Y6Am46eVU/50016 AND WHAT WAS SO STRIKING ABOUT THAT TIME WAS INSTEAD OF REPULSING PEOPLE I WAS ACTUALLY PROVING TO BE A MAGNET
trainval/G2Y6Am46eVU/50017 PEOPLE WERE INCREDIBLY DRAWN
trainval/G2Y6Am46eVU/50018 INSTEAD IT WAS EVERYBODY RUNNING THE OTHER WAY
trainval/G2Y6Am46eVU/50019 BUT WHEN I CAME TO SEE YOU I SAID I DIDN'T BELIEVE IN MYSELF
trainval/G2Y6Am46eVU/50020 I WAS AT A WALL
trainval/G2Y6Am46eVU/50021 EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT ARE UNDER 21
trainval/G2Y6Am46eVU/50022 MAY YOU FIND A MUD PUDDLE TO JUMP IN SOMEPLACE OR FIND A WAY TO GET OVER AROUND OR THROUGH ANY WALL THAT STANDS BETWEEN
trainval/g3TyY9y8mBc/50001 I ADVERTISED THE FITNESS CLASS DOWN ON THE LOCAL BEACH
trainval/g3TyY9y8mBc/50002 PEOPLE LATER TOLD ME THAT WAS GENIUS OUTDOOR TRAINING
trainval/g3TyY9y8mBc/50003 WE ARE COMING BACK FOR YOU DON'T GO ANYWHERE
trainval/g3TyY9y8mBc/50004 THE GUARDS PULL UP AT THE END OF THE SESSION PUT DOWN THE WINDOW THEY SAY PAT LOCK YOUR BIKE GRAB YOUR
trainval/g3TyY9y8mBc/50005 I TURN AROUND TO PICK UP MY THINGS
trainval/g3TyY9y8mBc/50006 AS I DO THEY START LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY THEY SAY WE'VE A BIG GUY IN THE BACK THAT NEEDS TO GET IN SHAPE WILL YOU LOOK AFTER HIM
trainval/g3TyY9y8mBc/50007 EVENTUALLY CURIOSITY GOT THE BETTER OF HIM
trainval/g3TyY9y8mBc/50008 FROM A DISTANCE YOU SAW A GROUP DOING EXERCISES AND RUNNING BETWEEN CONES BUT REALLY WHAT IT WAS ABOUT WAS
trainval/g3TyY9y8mBc/50009 I WENT TO THE BEACH AND I TRIED TO GIVE THAT TO FIVE MORE PEOPLE
trainval/g3TyY9y8mBc/50010 THAT ONE CONVERSATION RESULTED IN HUNDRED OF CLIENTS IN GALWAY AND THAT ONE CONVERSATION RESULTED IN THOUSANDS OF CLIENTS
trainval/g3TyY9y8mBc/50011 THAT ONE CONVERSATION RESULTED IN A QUARTER OF A MILLION FOR CHARITY AND THAT ONE CONVERSATION RESULTED IN 200000 PEOPLE A
trainval/g3TyY9y8mBc/50012 THAT'S THE POWER THAT ONE CONVERSATION CAN HAVE AND ONE INTERACTION CAN HAVE
trainval/G5pvUaMgfC8/50001 THIS ONE THURSDAY AFTERNOON I WAS WALKING ACROSS CAMPUS WITH MY BOYFRIEND AND WE WERE DEBATING BACK AND FORTH ABOUT WHAT I SHOULD
trainval/G5pvUaMgfC8/50002 SHE'S A REALLY SMART STUDENT ENGLISH LIT PROGRAM HONORS YOU KNOW THE TYPE
trainval/G5pvUaMgfC8/50003 MY SPEECH WAS BROKEN INTO THREE SECTIONS
trainval/G6dfUFgKmN4/50001 ASPERGER'S SYNDROME IS A DISORDER ON THE MILD END OF THE AUTISM SPECTRUM AND ITS MOST
trainval/G6dfUFgKmN4/50002 IF I HAVE IT IN MY MIND THAT SOMETHING IS SUPPOSED TO BE A CERTAIN WAY AND IT DOES NOT
trainval/G6dfUFgKmN4/50003 I AM DIFFERENT
trainval/G6dfUFgKmN4/50004 IT DOES NOT REALLY MATTER WHY YOU ARE
trainval/G6dfUFgKmN4/50005 THERE ARE TWO PROGRAMS THAT I'M A PART OF THAT HAVE HELPED ME LEARN SOME SOCIAL SKILLS AND I
trainval/G6dfUFgKmN4/50006 THE FIRST ONE IS TOASTMASTERS
trainval/G88JZ1DIdg8/50001 NO I'M GOING TO TAKE THAT BACK
trainval/G88JZ1DIdg8/50002 5 MILLION DOLLARS AND THEY PROVIDED 252 JOBS
trainval/G88JZ1DIdg8/50003 THEY HELD ON TO HOPE
trainval/G88JZ1DIdg8/50004 THEY NEVER GAVE UP
trainval/G88JZ1DIdg8/50005 THEY ALWAYS KEPT FIGHTING
trainval/G88JZ1DIdg8/50006 ENTER DETROIT VEGAN SOUL
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50001 AND THE USUAL THING HAPPENED WE RUSHED ACROSS CAMPUS AND AT THE END OF THE DAY JUST BEFORE GETTING TO BED I WAS
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50002 IS MY LIFE SIMPLY TOO BUSY WITH ESSAYS
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50003 THE SOCIAL PLATFORMS THAT CLAIM TO MAKE US MORE SOCIAL
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50005 BUT THE SECOND THING I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH A CHALLENGE A CHALLENGE IN THE SENSE OF IT'S A PROMISE A PROMISE FOR YOURSELF TO CHANGE FOR
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50006 SO HERE'S WHERE I WANT TO TAKE A SECOND TO ASK YOU A VERY SIMPLE BUT RATHER SIGNIFICANT QUESTION
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50007 AND SO WE START FAKING OUR LIVES
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50008 WE WOULD ALWAYS WANT TO BE THE OTHER PERFECT PERSON
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50009 WE WOULD ALWAYS WANT TO INCREASE OUR LIKES AND THAT'S VERY DANGEROUS
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50010 YOU START CREATING AN IDEAL SELF OF YOURSELF IT'S LIKE A SUPERHERO
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50011 BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50012 I SAID DAD LISTEN I CAN'T DO THIS I HAVE TO LEAVE
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50013 I'M FALLING AND MY GRADES ARE BAD I NEED TO LEAVE
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50014 BUT I REMEMBER VERY CLEARLY I LOOKED AT MYSELF IN THE MIRROR THAT DAY AND I ASKED MYSELF ONE SIMPLE QUESTION
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50015 WHAT EXACTLY DO I KNOW ABOUT MYSELF TO HAVE EVEN DECIDED I WANT TO STAY HERE
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50016 WHERE DO I WANT TO BE IN FOUR YEARS
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50017 WHAT'S MY OBJECTIVE OF DECIDING TO STAY HERE
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50018 WHERE DO I WANT TO BE
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50019 AND THAT'S A BIG QUESTION
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50020 WHAT EXACTLY IS THAT MOMENT OF MY DAY THAT I WOULD DO AND I WOULD LOVE TO APPRECIATE AND EMBRACE IT MORE OFTEN
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50021 SO NOW I WAS OBSESSED OVER PAUSING
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50022 I'M NOT OBSESSED OVER SOCIAL MEDIA ANYMORE
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50023 NOW I COULD PAUSE IN THE MORNING
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50025 PAUSING IS THE THINGS THAT YOU DO ALREADY
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50026 EVEN BEING HERE TODAY COULD BE A PAUSE MOMENT
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50027 BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT AWARE OF IT THEN YOU WOULDN'T REALLY CARE IF IT GOES AWAY FROM YOUR LIFE
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50028 YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50029 AND I MEAN IT WHEN I SAY A LOT
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50030 AND THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
trainval/G8cjIBwP52o/50031 AND I WOULD HAVE SIMPLY SAID BEING ON THE STAGE IS OUT OF REACH
trainval/G8gJJuCdPSA/50001 WHAT DO HUNTERS WANT
trainval/G8gJJuCdPSA/50002 WELL THEY WANT TO HUNT
trainval/G8gJJuCdPSA/50003 THEY LOVE THEIR GUNS
trainval/G8gJJuCdPSA/50004 I MEET SO MANY OF THESE PARENTS IT'S THE MOST HEARTBREAKING PART OF MY JOB
trainval/G8gJJuCdPSA/50005 FOR SOMEBODY LIKE ME WATCHING PEOPLE WAVE AROUND THEIR NEGATIVE NRA
trainval/G8gJJuCdPSA/50006 YOU KNOW THEY SAY THAT THE INTERNET DEMOCRATIZES INFORMATION
trainval/G8gJJuCdPSA/50007 WE'RE MARCHING ACROSS THE COUNTRY STATE BY STATE MARRIAGE EQUALITY STYLE
trainval/G8gJJuCdPSA/50008 AND YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/G8w4UQL6aI0/50001 AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT ARCHITECTURE IS BASED ON
trainval/G8w4UQL6aI0/50002 IT'S BASED ON WONDER
trainval/G8w4UQL6aI0/50003 AND I THINK THAT IS INDEED WHAT ARCHITECTURE IS
trainval/G8w4UQL6aI0/50004 IF YOU THINK OF THE GREAT BUILDINGS OF THE CATHEDRALS OF THE TEMPLES OF THE PYRAMIDS OF PAGODAS OF CITIES
trainval/G8w4UQL6aI0/50005 AND IT'S LIKE ESPRESSO COFFEE YOU KNOW YOU TAKE THE ESSENCE OF THE COFFEE
trainval/G8w4UQL6aI0/50006 THAT'S WHAT EXPRESSION IS
trainval/G8w4UQL6aI0/50007 AND YET I BELIEVE IT IS THE EXPRESSION EXPRESSION OF THE CITY EXPRESSION OF OUR OWN SPACE THAT GIVES
trainval/G8w4UQL6aI0/50008 AND I THINK OUR ARCHITECTURE IS A CONFRONTATION WITH OUR OWN SENSES
trainval/G8w4UQL6aI0/50009 EVEN THE MIND IS EMOTIONAL
trainval/G8w4UQL6aI0/50010 WE CAN CREATE INCREDIBLE THINGS
trainval/G8w4UQL6aI0/50011 AND OF COURSE WE ARE ALL ABOUT THE STRUGGLE OF EMOTIONS
trainval/G8w4UQL6aI0/50012 AND YET AT THE END IT'S SO HARD TO CHANGE A WALL
trainval/G8w4UQL6aI0/50013 WE APPLAUD THE WELL MANNERED BOX
trainval/G8w4UQL6aI0/50014 AND WE LIVE IN A WORLD WHICH IS CONNECTING US MORE AND MORE
trainval/G8w4UQL6aI0/50015 AND ARCHITECTURE IS SO CLOSELY INTERTWINED WITH IT BECAUSE WE ARE BORN SOMEWHERE AND WE DIE SOMEWHERE
trainval/G8w4UQL6aI0/50016 SO THE REALITY OF ARCHITECTURE IS VISCERAL
trainval/G8w4UQL6aI0/50017 WE WOULD NOT KNOW WHICH WAY WE WERE GOING AND WHY WE ARE GOING WHERE WE'RE GOING
trainval/G8w4UQL6aI0/50018 IT'S AN ART OF COMMUNICATION
trainval/G8w4UQL6aI0/50019 IT'S SUCH A COMPLEX PROJECT
trainval/G8w4UQL6aI0/50020 THERE IS SO MANY INTERESTS
trainval/G8w4UQL6aI0/50021 THERE IS SO MANY PARTIES TO THIS PROJECT
trainval/G8w4UQL6aI0/50022 THERE IS SO MANY INTERESTS
trainval/G8w4UQL6aI0/50023 I CAME FROM THE BRONX
trainval/G8w4UQL6aI0/50024 YOU HAVE TO FIGHT FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE
trainval/g985z9Wq5gk/50001 TINY PROJECTS PAPER MACHE VOLCANOES NOTHING THAT TRULY SMACKED OF ACTUAL
trainval/g985z9Wq5gk/50002 BUT MY IDEAS ABOUT RESEARCH GOT TURNED ON THEIR HEAD WHEN I WENT TO MY FIRST SCIENCE
trainval/g985z9Wq5gk/50003 I FOUND THIS COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE WHO WERE ALSO LOVING SCIENCE WHO WERE DOING THEIR OWN
trainval/g985z9Wq5gk/50004 IT'S CLEAN IT'S CARBON NEUTRAL
trainval/g985z9Wq5gk/50005 ALGAE BIOFUELS JUST SIMPLY AREN'T COMPETITIVE WITH FOSSIL FUELS
trainval/g985z9Wq5gk/50006 BUT IF WE CAN INCREASE THE OIL YIELDS OF ALGAE WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE THEM A FEASIBLE CONTENDER
trainval/g985z9Wq5gk/50007 AND THIS WAS THE IDEA THAT I WORKED ON DEVELOPING DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING OVER THE PAST
trainval/g985z9Wq5gk/50010 I EMAILED PROFESSORS AND FACULTY MEMBERS AT UNIVERSITIES ASKING QUESTIONS BEGGING FOR LAB
trainval/g985z9Wq5gk/50011 THE THING IS THAT RESEARCH ISN'T EASY
trainval/g985z9Wq5gk/50012 TECHNIQUES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO GO SMOOTHLY DON'T
trainval/g985z9Wq5gk/50013 SO WHAT THIS SEEMS TO MEAN IS THAT I SEEM TO HAVE CAUSED A LASTING GENETIC CHANGE IN MY ALGAE POPULATIONS
trainval/g985z9Wq5gk/50014 I EVEN SLEEP ON MY ALGAE'S LIGHT CYCLE
trainval/g985z9Wq5gk/50015 16 HOURS ON EIGHT HOURS OFF
trainval/g9M3HIjHuq0/50001 IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME THAT THE COMMUNITY FELT CONNECTED TO THE WORDS
trainval/g9M3HIjHuq0/50002 THEY LIVE FROM THE GARBAGE
trainval/g9M3HIjHuq0/50003 YOU KNOW THE ART PROJECT WAS JUST A PRETEXT FOR THIS AMAZING HUMAN EXPERIENCE
trainval/G9wIXAGzn1w/50001 AND ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER THAT WE WERE INVITED TO GO BACK AND SEE HIM
trainval/G9wIXAGzn1w/50002 I START TO LOOK AROUND AND I SEE WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE HAS
trainval/G9wIXAGzn1w/50003 IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE COULD CHANGE OUR LIVES AND FIND THAT PURPOSE MEANING AND JOY
trainval/gAxSu7UgPGg/50001 SO I PULLED HIM ASIDE AND WE GOT TO CHATTING
trainval/gAxSu7UgPGg/50002 WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE
trainval/gAxSu7UgPGg/50003 WHEN I WAS 15 I GOT A CHANCE TO MEET A DIFFERENT BOY
trainval/gAxSu7UgPGg/50004 AT THE AGE OF 6 HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PDD NOS WHICH IS A CONDITION ON THE AUTISM
trainval/gaY4m00wXpw/50001 WELL THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT THINGS
trainval/gaY4m00wXpw/50002 SURELY IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO ADDRESS THAT
trainval/gaY4m00wXpw/50004 THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT THINGS
trainval/GB4s5b9NL3I/50001 ONE PEAK YOU UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW IT YOU RECOGNIZE IT IS THE MOUNTAIN OF DEBTS THAT HAS BEEN
trainval/GB4s5b9NL3I/50002 AM I RIGHT IN BELIEVING THAT DEMOCRACY MIGHT BE THE ANSWER
trainval/GB4s5b9NL3I/50003 NOW OF COURSE ATHENIAN DEMOCRACY EXCLUDED TOO MANY
trainval/GB4s5b9NL3I/50004 NOW OF COURSE ATHENIAN DEMOCRACY DIDN'T LAST LONG
trainval/GB4s5b9NL3I/50005 AND INDEED LIBERAL DEMOCRACY ONLY SURFACED WHEN IT WAS POSSIBLE TO SEPARATE FULLY THE
trainval/GB4s5b9NL3I/50006 AND IMAGINE THAT THAT FUND IS UTILIZED TO INVEST IN GREEN TECHNOLOGIES
trainval/GB4s5b9NL3I/50007 IT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE CONFINED AS I WAS SAYING IN MY TALK DEMOCRACY TO THE POLITICAL SPHERE WHILE LEAVING THE ONE
trainval/GB4s5b9NL3I/50009 JOHN STUART MILL WAS PARTICULARLY SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS
trainval/GB4s5b9NL3I/50010 TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE COMPLACENCY AND THE CONSTANT DENIAL THAT THERE WAS A MASSIVE AND THERE IS A
trainval/GB4s5b9NL3I/50011 IF THERE'S ANY MINISTER OF FINANCE OR OF ANYTHING ELSE FOR THAT MATTER WHO TELLS YOU AFTER SIX MONTHS IN A JOB
trainval/GB4s5b9NL3I/50012 OF COURSE I MADE MISTAKES
trainval/GB4s5b9NL3I/50013 BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCES THAT WILL BE UNLEASHED WILL BE DEMONIC
trainval/GB4s5b9NL3I/50014 AND THAT WILL BE CATASTROPHIC NOT JUST FOR EUROPE BUT FOR THE WHOLE GLOBAL ECONOMY
trainval/gbDraZi7FS4/50001 LOUIS MY ENTIRE LIFE
trainval/gbDraZi7FS4/50002 WHEN MICHAEL BROWN JR
trainval/gBGt5OeAQFk/50002 PLANTS FOR EXAMPLE ARE ABLE TO MEMORIZE
trainval/gBkIyJ7kfSI/50001 THERE'S A LOT MORE TO IT THAN I'M GOING TO GET TO TODAY
trainval/gBkIyJ7kfSI/50002 JUST TRY THAT WITH ME IF YOU WOULD OKAY
trainval/gBkIyJ7kfSI/50003 YOU HAVE A NATURAL PREFERENCE FOR HOW YOU CROSS YOUR ARMS
trainval/gBkIyJ7kfSI/50004 SO TRY CROSSING THEM IN THE OTHER WAY
trainval/gBkIyJ7kfSI/50005 NOW I THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO KNOW ABOUT PERSONALITY TYPE FOR TWO REASONS
trainval/gBkIyJ7kfSI/50006 BUT THAT DOESN'T EXCUSE YOURSELF FROM TRYING
trainval/gBkIyJ7kfSI/50007 I CAN ASSURE YOU WE'RE ALL JUST FINE TODAY
trainval/gBkIyJ7kfSI/50008 WE BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE BOTH WITHIN YOU
trainval/gBkIyJ7kfSI/50009 IF YOU JUST DO EVERYTHING ACCORDING TO YOUR PREFERENCES IT'S NOT GOING TO ALWAYS WORK
trainval/gBkIyJ7kfSI/50010 ARE THEY LISTENING TO ME
trainval/gBkIyJ7kfSI/50011 INTERRUPTIONS FOR EXTROVERTS ACTUALLY MAY BE COMPLIMENTS
trainval/gBkIyJ7kfSI/50012 IT'S A COMPLIMENT
trainval/gBkIyJ7kfSI/50013 I'M GLAD YOU GOT THAT
trainval/gBkIyJ7kfSI/50014 THEY BECOME AWARE OF HOW IS THIS GOING TO IMPACT PEOPLE
trainval/gBkIyJ7kfSI/50015 THIS HAND REPRESENTS COMPLETING THE PROJECT
trainval/gBkIyJ7kfSI/50016 OUR MEMORIES ARE JUST FINE
trainval/gBkIyJ7kfSI/50017 I THINK I'M WORKING FOR AN IDIOT
trainval/gBkIyJ7kfSI/50018 THEY HAVE NO SENSE OF STANDARDS AND WHAT IS GOOD WORK
trainval/gBkIyJ7kfSI/50019 THEY JUST DO IT IN DIFFERENT WAYS
trainval/gBkIyJ7kfSI/50020 SO YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE GO TO A CHINESE RESTAURANT
trainval/gBkIyJ7kfSI/50021 SOMEONE CAME UP WITH THEM FOR ME
trainval/gBkIyJ7kfSI/50022 YOU PROBABLY HAVE ALREADY FIGURED IT OUT
trainval/gBkIyJ7kfSI/50023 THE ONLY TRICK IS WE HAVE TO USE AN N FOR INTUITION BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY USED THE I UP FOR
trainval/gBkIyJ7kfSI/50024 YOURS IS GOING TO BE THE MYERS BRIGGS
trainval/gBkIyJ7kfSI/50025 I MENTIONED I DO SOME TRAINING PROGRAMS AND AS PART OF THAT TRAINING I WOULD TYPICALLY
trainval/gBkIyJ7kfSI/50026 BUT SUDDENLY WITH PERSONALITY TYPE SHE HAD A FRAMEWORK TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING
trainval/gBkIyJ7kfSI/50027 SO PERSONALITY TYPE HAS BEEN ENOURMOUSLY HELPFUL TO ME IN UNDERSTANDING MYSELF AND OTHERS
trainval/GbYc9BOU30o/50001 FEWER THAN 20 ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IRREDEEMABLE SOCIOPATHS
trainval/GbYc9BOU30o/50002 WE DO NOT PRETEND THAT THEIR CRIME NEVER HAPPENED
trainval/GbYc9BOU30o/50003 HERE IS WHY THIS MATTERS
trainval/gC1CVOn8JQk/50001 YOU CAN SEE WHY THE BUBBLE IS IMPORTANT
trainval/GcJxRqTs5nk/50001 THIS IS THE WAY BONOBOS DO IT
trainval/GcJxRqTs5nk/50002 THEY DIDN'T LIKE THIS AT ALL
trainval/GcJxRqTs5nk/50003 SO IT IS CONNECTED
trainval/GCOc31fQi7A/50001 WE ACTUALLY USE WAVE TECHNOLOGY ON OUR OPEN POND SYSTEMS WE HAVE 95 MIXING AND
trainval/gCWeVYCcKXw/50001 AND THE TECHNOLOGY WAS VERY FASCINATING TO ME
trainval/gCWeVYCcKXw/50002 BUT IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD THIS IS EXTREMELY RADICAL THIS NOTION THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO SPEAK FREELY THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE
trainval/gCWeVYCcKXw/50003 AND WHAT IS THAT EXACTLY
trainval/gCWeVYCcKXw/50004 BUT AS IT JUST SO HAPPENS THE INTERESTING NOTION HERE IS THIS IDEA THAT SOMEHOW BECAUSE YOU DON'T SHOW IT TO SOMEONE
trainval/gCWeVYCcKXw/50005 THAT'S KIND OF STRANGE
trainval/gCWeVYCcKXw/50006 SO ASSUMING THAT THE PERSON THAT WISHES TO KNOW YOU ARE CANNOT WATCH THE ENTIRE INTERNET ALL AT THE SAME
trainval/gCWeVYCcKXw/50007 WHERE SURVEILLANCE IS OFTEN IN SUPPORT OF AUTHORITARIANISM AND SPECIFICALLY IN SUPPORT OF VIOLENCE
trainval/gCWeVYCcKXw/50008 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AUTONOMY
trainval/gCWeVYCcKXw/50009 AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ABILITY FOR EACH OF US TO DEVELOP AS A HUMAN WITHOUT THAT
trainval/gCWeVYCcKXw/50010 IN FACT MOST OF US PROBABLY ALREADY CAN TELL THAT STORY
trainval/gCWeVYCcKXw/50011 BECAUSE IT DIS EMPOWERS PEOPLE WHO ARE OTHERWISE TOTALLY LITERATE
trainval/gCWeVYCcKXw/50012 I COME AT THIS FROM THE HUMAN RIGHTS PERSPECTIVE
trainval/gCWeVYCcKXw/50013 SOMETIMES IT WORKS QUITE WELL SOMETIMES YOU JUST CAN'T CONNECT
trainval/gCWeVYCcKXw/50014 AND THE IDEA IS TO COMPARTMENTALIZE THIS BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE TO TRUST ONE AGENCY TO NEVER BETRAY YOU THAT MEANS
trainval/gCWeVYCcKXw/50015 AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO HIDE AND SO ON
trainval/gCWeVYCcKXw/50016 SO IT'S NICE BECAUSE IT CAN HELP DISPEL THAT NOTION
trainval/gCWeVYCcKXw/50017 I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE UNDERSTAND THIS AND YET EUROPE HAS MANDATORY DATA RETENTION NOT JUST FOR PHONE CALL RELATED STUFF
trainval/gdg4mUSwuhI/50001 SO THESE COMMUNITIES BEGAN TO EVOLVE SO THAT THE INTERESTING LEVEL ON WHICH EVOLUTION WAS TAKING PLACE WAS NO LONGER A
trainval/gdg4mUSwuhI/50002 SO WHAT WAS THE NEXT STEP
trainval/gdg4mUSwuhI/50003 WRITING DOWN THE DNA WAS AN INTERESTING STEP
trainval/gdg4mUSwuhI/50004 AND TRY THAT AGAIN AND DO THAT FOR ANOTHER GENERATION
trainval/gdg4mUSwuhI/50005 I'VE TRIED LOOKING AT THEM AND TELLING YOU HOW THEY WORK
trainval/gdg4mUSwuhI/50006 SCORE THEM AGAIN
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50003 CURIOSITY AND WANTING TO FIND OUT ABOUT THINGS IS A MASSIVE MOTIVATOR AND IT ALSO STIMULATES THE REWARD
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50004 YEARS AGO WHEN MY CHILDREN WERE REALLY
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50005 SO SHE TRIED SOME OF THE COOKING APPLE
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50006 BOTH MUNCHKIN AND BUMP HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE OF THE BITTER
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50007 AND IT IS NOT TRUE
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50008 NOTHING IS SET IN STONE EVER
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50010 AND NOW THE TASTE IS PROPERLY FORMED SO THE BABY CAN TASTE THINGS THROUGH THE AMNIOTIC SAC
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50011 THE FIRST FIVE BASIC FLAVORS ARE
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50012 SO ALL IS GOOD
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50013 SO BABY MUMCHKIN HAS GOT THESE BASIC TASTES GOING ON
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50014 BUT OF COURSE THE MOTHER EXPERIENCING ALL THOSE FOOD FOR REAL IS
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50016 SO THERE'S HELP FOR MUNCHKIN BECAUSE MUNCHKIN IS COMING ALONG NOW
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50017 MUMCHKIN IS BORN
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50018 BECAUSE IT IS JUST A LIST
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50019 THE COMBINATION OF ALL THESE THINGS IS ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50020 THE POINT IS THE MENU IS INFINITE
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50021 AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50022 AND EQUALLY OUR AGING BRAIN LOVES IT EVEN MORE BECAUSE IT HELPS OUR AGING BRAIN STAY HEALTHY
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50023 SO CURIOSITY IS THE MAIN MOTIVATOR FOR US TO STAY INTERESTED IN THINGS SO
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50025 WE NOW KNOW THAT WHATEVER WE LEARN WHATEVER WE ARE DOING WHATEVER WE ARE INTERACTING WITH WILL
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50026 WE HAVE GOT THIS WONDERFUL MENU OF ALL THE THINGS OR MENUS OF ALL THESE EQUATIONS OF THINGS WE CAN DO IN LIFE
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50028 OLDER PARENTS YOUNGER CHILDREN
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50029 IT MIGHT BE THAT
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50030 BUT SOMETIMES I THINK THAT YES THOSE THINGS DO RESTRICT US BUT NOT AS MUCH AS WE LIKE TO THINK THEY DO
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50032 YOU CAN LEARN ANYTHING YOU CAN INVOLVE YOURSELF IN DIFFERENT KINDS OF SOCIAL GROUPS ALL SORTS OF STUFF
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50033 AS LONG AS YOUR ARE CURIOUS
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50034 THE WHOLE WEEKEND WAS LIKE THAT
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50035 THEIR CURIOSITY WAS ENORMOUS
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50036 WE WENT ON FRIDAY NIGHT DUE TO COME HOME ON THESUNDAY
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50037 THEY HAD EMBRACED THIS WHOLE NEW WORLD
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50038 BUT IN THAT SAME WEEKEND I LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT MY OWN CURIOSITY
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50039 I ACTUALLY WENT ON THIS WEEKEND WITH A FRIEND
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50040 IT WAS FOR YOGA AND MEDITATION FOR ADULTS AND LITTLE PEOPLE
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50041 SHE WAS TAKING AGES AND AGES TO COME OUT AFTER SAYING GOODBYE TO ALL THESE PEOPLE
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50042 I'VE GOT TO GO TRAFFIC IS BUILDING UP
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50045 AND MY FRIEND AND THIS GIRL IN THE BACK WERE TALKING
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50046 AND I WASN'T TAKING MUCH NOTICE BECAUSE I WAS IN TOO MUCH OF A FOUL MOOD BY NOW
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50047 SHE STARTED TO EXPLAIN IT AND THE MORE SHE EXPLAINED THE MORE QUESTIONS I ASKED
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50049 BECAUSE I CAN PINPOINT THE EXACT DAY WHEN I FIRST REALISED THAT MY CORE OF MY VERY BEING WAS
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50050 I WAS AGE SEVEN
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50051 I SHOOT SHOT RIGHT BACK TO THEN AND I THOUGHT
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50052 SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY IS ALL ABOUT PEOPLE
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50053 I WAS SO FIRED UP SO FIRED UP THAT I GOT HOME PUT THE CHILDREN TO BED I WAS COMPLETELY
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50054 BECAUSE I HAD SMALL CHILDREN I HAD TO THINK ABOUT A UNIVERSITY THAT WAS LOCAL TO WHERE I LIVED
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50055 SO I FOUND A UNIVERSITY THAT DID SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY AND I HAD TO CHOOSE IT WITH ANOTHER SUBJECT SO I CHOSE IT WITH
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50056 ONE OF THESE GAMES WAS
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50057 WITHIN THE FOURTH YEAR I REALISED ACTUALLY SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY WAS SO HARD THAT ACTUALLY
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50058 I WOULDN'T BE
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50059 ALL THE CHILDREN HAD TO SIT ON A CIRCLE AND EACH CHILD TOOK IN TURNS TO BE IN THE MIDDLE
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50060 PLEASE STAY CURIOUS
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50061 BECAUSE WHAT THERE IS AT THE END OF IT IS INESTIMABLE
trainval/GDnYDLERnRE/50062 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/gDS1Eh6rqf8/50001 I'D GET A FLASHLIGHT
trainval/gDS1Eh6rqf8/50002 AND THAT'S THE STORY I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU TONIGHT
trainval/gDS1Eh6rqf8/50003 MY WIN IS YOUR LOSS
trainval/gDS1Eh6rqf8/50004 THERE S MORE THAN ONE RIGHT ANSWER
trainval/gDS1Eh6rqf8/50005 THERE ARE A THOUSAND WAYS TO COME AT ANY CHALLENGE TO FIND THAT EXTRAORDINARY VIEW
trainval/gDS1Eh6rqf8/50006 AND I WAS SETTING UP WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THE LAST DISMAL SHOT OF A DISMAL DAY
trainval/gDS1Eh6rqf8/50007 THEY ALL WANT TO TRY IT ON
trainval/gDS1Eh6rqf8/50008 I SAID YEAH I GOT ONE
trainval/gDS1Eh6rqf8/50009 SO WE WENT DOWN INTO THE WOODS AND I GOT MY FIRST SHOT
trainval/ge3SS1hOm1s/50001 THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO SENSE AND COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50001 SO LAST YEAR I RAN FOR MAYOR OF MY HOMETOWN TULSA OKLAHOMA
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50002 AND I WAS THE UNDERDOG RUNNING AGAINST A TWO TERM INCUMBENT
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50003 INCREASING PER CAPITA INCOME IN OUR CITY INCREASING OUR CITY'S POPULATION
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50004 AND WE STUCK TO THOSE RELENTLESSLY THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN ALWAYS BRINGING IT
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50005 AND A FUNNY THING HAPPENED WHEN WE DID THAT
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50006 MY OPPONENT RAN THE CLASSIC PARTISAN PLAYBOOK
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50007 AND SO ON ELECTION DAY I G
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50008 BYNUM A GUY WHOSE NAME REMINDS PEOPLE OF A CIRCUS PROMOTER
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50009 WHY DO WE ALWAYS ALLOW OURSELVES TO FALL BACK ON PHILOSOPHICAL DISAGREEMENTS THAT ULTIMATELY
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50010 HE PUBLICIZED HIS ENDORSEMENT OF DONALD TRUMP
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50011 THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM IS THAT TO WIN AN ELECTION YOU HAVE TO DUMB IT DOWN AND PLAY TO YOUR
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50012 MITCH DANIELS SERVED AS GEORGE W
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50013 BUSH'S BUDGET DIRECTOR
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50014 DURING THAT TIME HE CREATED WHAT WAS CALLED THE PART TOOL
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50015 HE PUBLICIZED A LETTER HE SENT TO PRESIDENT OBAMA PROTESTING SYRIAN REFUGEES EVEN THOUGH NONE OF
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50016 AND USING THIS THEY EVALUATED OVER 1000 FEDERAL PROGRAMS
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50017 OVER 150 PROGRAMS HAD THEIR FUNDING REDUCED BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT DEMONSTRATE
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50018 NOW WHEN MAYOR O'MALLEY TOOK OFFICE HE WAS A BIG FAN OF WHAT THEY'D BEEN ABLE TO DO IN NEW YORK CITY WHEN IT CAME TO
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50019 GIULIANI SHRUNK THAT TIME FRAME SO THAT CRIME STATISTICS WOULD BE COLLECTED ON A DAILY EVEN
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50020 WELL O'MALLEY LOVED THAT APPROACH AND HE APPLIED IT IN BALTIMORE
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50021 AND THE OVERALL APPROACH IS A VERY SIMPLE ONE
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50022 WE'VE FOUND IT TO BE AN ENGINE FOR CREATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50023 BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE FOCUSED ON A GOAL AND YOU CAN TEST DIFFERENT STRATEGIES QUICKLY
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50024 OF COURSE NOT
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50025 AND IN TULSA WE HAVE DECIDED TO BUILD A CITY WHERE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS USE
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50026 LOUISVILLE HAS USED THIS NOT JUST FOR THEIR CITY BUT IN A COMMUNITY WIDE EFFORT BRINGING
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50027 LET'S GRASP THE OPPORTUNITY THAT IS PRESENTED BY INNOVATION TO BUILD BETTER COMMUNITIES FOR
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50028 THAT IS THE PATH TO A BETTER FUTURE FOR US ALL
trainval/GeDSgi0A7A8/50029 THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
trainval/gEH4gSeSt3g/50001 I'M OK WITH SAYING NO TO THINGS I'M OK WITH SAYING YES TO THINGS AND I'M OK WITH BEING ABLE TO
trainval/gEH4gSeSt3g/50002 AND IT'S ALSO THE SAME GOD THAT LOOKS AFTER ME IN EVERY ASPECT OF MY LIFE
trainval/gEH4gSeSt3g/50003 MY FATHER PASSED OUT AND HE WAS DRAGGED OUT IN A WHEELCHAIR AND HE WAS CRYING OUT IN THE LOBBY
trainval/gEH4gSeSt3g/50005 AND OUT OF MY MOTHER'S CURIOSITY SHE WENT THROUGHOUT MY BIRTH RECORDS AND TO HER DISMAY SHE FOUND OUT THAT I WAS A
trainval/gEH4gSeSt3g/50006 HOW SIMPLE IS THAT
trainval/gEH4gSeSt3g/50007 I DON'T BELIEVE I HAVE TO LOOK ANOTHER HUMAN BEING IN THE FACE AND TELL THEM WHAT I DID WRONG LAST WEEK
trainval/gEH4gSeSt3g/50008 SO LET'S START OVER
trainval/gEH4gSeSt3g/50009 AND THEN THE NEXT WEEK WHEN THEY RUN UP TO ME AGAIN AND GO LIKE
trainval/gEH4gSeSt3g/50011 GANDHI KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WHEN HE SAID THAT
trainval/gevXeQwS1jg/50001 THERE ARE TWO MAYOR REASONS FOR THAT
trainval/gF9PSRLjGGw/50001 BUT THERE'S ANOTHER WORLD TOO
trainval/GFXHYtY9ag8/50001 AND IT S SO TRAGIC
trainval/GFXHYtY9ag8/50002 AND THAT HAS REALLY SPREAD THROUGH THE INTERNET LIKE WILDFIRE
trainval/GFXHYtY9ag8/50003 THEY MAKE THEIR OWN LISTS
trainval/GFXHYtY9ag8/50004 THEY MAKE THEIR OWN
trainval/GFXHYtY9ag8/50005 THIS IS A COLLAGE THAT SOMEBODY MADE ON FLICKR AND THESE WERE ALL JUST PICTURES THAT MADE HER REALLY HAPPY THAT WEEK
trainval/GFXHYtY9ag8/50006 AND THE TRUTH IS THAT THE WORLD IS A LOT BIGGER THAN THAT
trainval/GgBpyNsSSjU/50001 OR MAYBE OWNING A BUNCH OF STUFF MAYBE THAT WAS RICH
trainval/GggL8lStP9I/50001 DON'T TELL ME IT WAS THE NORM
trainval/GggL8lStP9I/50002 SHE WAS SO HAPPY
trainval/GggL8lStP9I/50003 SEE I WAS DESPERATE TO LEAVE IRAN
trainval/GggL8lStP9I/50004 I WANTED THE SAME OPPORTUNITY AS MY TWO OLDER BROTHERS WHO LEFT BEFORE ME TO COME TO THE UNITED
trainval/GggL8lStP9I/50005 IT IS TIME TO SAY NO MORE
trainval/ggPh4X7UKwY/50001 THEY HAD TO TAKE THE PART BACK TO AMERICA THEY HAD TO REVERSE ENGINEER IT AND THEN INSTALL IT
trainval/ggPh4X7UKwY/50003 IT'S THE PLANE CRASH IN NIGERIA WHEN I LIVED THERE IN 2012
trainval/ggPh4X7UKwY/50004 3D PRINTERS YOU CAN BUY FOR 200 OR 300 DOLLARS NOW TO MAKE PROTOTYPES
trainval/ggPh4X7UKwY/50005 IT'S ALWAYS BEEN USED AS A PROTOTYPING TOOL BUT IT'S A LOT MORE THAN THAT
trainval/ggPh4X7UKwY/50006 THEY'RE ALL 3D PRINTED NOW
trainval/ggPh4X7UKwY/50007 BUT MORE THAN THAT EVEN
trainval/ggPh4X7UKwY/50008 SO WE'VE MOVED FROM A PROTOTYPING TOOL TO A CUSTOMIZATION TOOL AND NOW WE'RE MOVING TO A MANUFACTURING TOOL
trainval/ggPh4X7UKwY/50009 THIS IS A FUEL INJECTION NOZZLE FOR THE NEW GENERATION OF GE JET ENGINES
trainval/ggPh4X7UKwY/50010 10 OF EVERYTHING IS 1
trainval/ggPh4X7UKwY/50011 YOU HAVE THAT MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE HERE
trainval/ggPh4X7UKwY/50012 300000 PHONE LINES FOR THEN ABOUT 155 MILLION PEOPLE
trainval/ggPh4X7UKwY/50013 WE'VE HEARD ABOUT DRIVERLESS CARS
trainval/ggPh4X7UKwY/50014 AND THAT IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY
trainval/ggPh4X7UKwY/50015 SO JOIN ME ON THIS JOURNEY BRIEFLY AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOW YOU MAY BE ABLE TO ENGAGE
trainval/ggPh4X7UKwY/50016 THERE ARE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF MORE
trainval/ggPh4X7UKwY/50017 EVERY TIME WE ENGAGE WITH A NEW CLIENT THE STEPS MULTIPLY AND THERE ARE HUNDREDS ON STEPS IN THIS VALUE CHAIN
trainval/ggPh4X7UKwY/50018 SO I'M JUST GIVING YOU A 30000 FEET VIEW
trainval/ggPh4X7UKwY/50019 IF WE'RE SENDING A DIGITAL DESIGN ACROSS BORDERS WILL TAX IT THE SAME WAY
trainval/ggPh4X7UKwY/50020 PEOPLE LIKE YOU
trainval/ggPh4X7UKwY/50021 YOU HAVE TO PUT THESE THREE ELEMENTS TOGETHER
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50001 HOW MANY PEOPLE KNOW I MEAN REALLY KNOW WHAT TO DO ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS TO
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50002 MY POINT IS THIS
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50003 WE MAY KNOW WHAT A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP LOOKS LIKE BUT MOST PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO GET ONE AND
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50004 AFTER IT'S TOO LATE
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50005 IT IS CALLED COUPLES THERAPY
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50006 I DO COUPLES THERAPY AND IT CAN BE A WONDERFUL THING
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50007 BUT MANY PEOPLE COME TO COUPLES THERAPY WITH SO MANY INGRAINED PROBLEMS AND PATTERNS THAT THEY
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50008 IT'S TOO LATE
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50009 WHAT IF THEY SELECTED POORLY
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50010 AND RESEARCHERS WOULD AGREE TOO
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50011 I MEAN THE BEGINNING BEGINNING LIKE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50012 NOW TOWARDS THIS END MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE DEVELOPED A SKILLS BASED MODEL OF RELATIONSHIP
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50013 THERE IS A LARGE BODY OF LITERATURE ON ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS THAT HAS IDENTIFIED THE FEATURES OF HEALTHY
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50014 WE IDENTIFIED THE SKILLS BASED ON A THOROUGH REVIEW OF THEORY AND RESEARCH
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50015 AND BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT THE COMMONALITIES WE THINK THEY REALLY CAN HELP PEOPLE WITH ALL THE
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50016 WITH INSIGHT YOU MIGHT NOTICE OR REALIZE THAT IT'S NOT THAT YOUR PARTNER IS DOING ANYTHING BUT ACTUALLY YOU'RE
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50017 WHAT YOU REALLY NEED IS TO RELAX A LITTLE BIT SO IT DOESN'T BLEED OUT OVER INTO YOUR RELATIONSHIP
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50018 RESEARCHERS ALSO AGREE ON WHAT MAKES FOR UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS THINGS LIKE FIGHTING SO MUCH THAT YOU
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50019 LET'S SAY YOUR PARTNER SHOWS UP LATE FOR A DATE
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50020 IT'S NOTHING ABOUT YOU OR THE RELATIONSHIP
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50021 THAT'S JUST WHO YOUR PARTNER IS
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50022 WITH INSIGHT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES IN WAYS THAT ALLOW YOU TO BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY IN THE FUTURE
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50023 SO MAYBE YOU'LL RECOGNIZE THAT YOU'RE THE KIND OF PERSON WHO TENDS TO JUMP IN REALLY QUICKLY YOU GET WRAPPED UP IN THE
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50024 YOU ARE NOT OK WITH YOUR PARTNER SEEING OTHER PEOPLE
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50025 OR MAYBE YOU'LL REALIZE IT'S JUST THE OPPOSITE THAT YOU'RE NOT READY TO SETTLE DOWN AND YOU NEED A PARTNER WHO IS OK
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50026 YOU MIGHT SAY DIRECTLY
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50027 YOU KNOW THIS IS GOING TO BE STRESSFUL FOR ME
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50028 I'D REALLY LOVE FOR YOU TO BE THERE YOU'LL BE A REALLY GOOD BUFFER FOR ME
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50029 SO LET'S SAY YOU GET A GREAT JOB OFFER THAT YOU'D LIKE TO TAKE BUT YOU KNOW IT MEANS YOU WILL TO HAVE TO WORK MORE AND YOU
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50030 IF I PROMISE TO PROTECT SOME TIME FOR US WILL YOU BE OK WITH ME TAKING THIS JOB
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50031 THIS IS GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50032 THERE IS A WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50033 I'M GOING TO FIGURE THIS OUT
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50034 EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OK
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50035 THAT TEXT ISN'T COMING YOU'RE GETTING REALLY ANXIOUS YOU'RE CHECKING YOUR PHONE EVERY TWO SECONDS
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50036 WITH EMOTION REGULATION YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TELL YOURSELF YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50037 THE TEXT IS GOING TO COME
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50038 I DON'T NEED TO CHECK MY PHONE EVERY SECOND I'M JUST GOING TO PUT IT AWAY AND FOCUS ON THE TASK AT
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50039 SO LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A BREAKUP
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50040 IF YOU BEG AND PLEAD TO GET BACK TOGETHER YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF AND YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO BE IN A
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50041 SO GUESS WHAT
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50042 SHE DIDN'T GET ANYTHING
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50043 AND SHE GOT REALLY ANGRY AND THEY HAD A BIG FIGHT
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50044 INSIGHT ALSO WOULD HAVE LET HER KNOW THAT HER PARTNER WAS THE KIND OF GUY WHO WAS JUST GOING TO TAKE WHAT SHE SAID
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50045 SO YOU MIGHT THINK
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50046 SO MAYBE SHE WAS FEELING KIND OF ANXIOUS
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50047 I KNOW WE ARE SAVING FOR THAT TRIP BUT I REALLY LIKE THAT NECKLACE THAT WE SAW THE OTHER DAY AND IT WASN'T THAT EXPENSIVE
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50048 WE HAVE DATA TO SUPPORT THIS AS WELL
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50049 I'VE BEEN STUDYING ROMANTIC COMPETENCE THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO USE INSIGHT MUTUALITY AND EMOTION
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50050 IN ONE OF OUR STUDIES WE LOOKED AT 13 AND 14 YEAR OLD GIRLS EARLY ADOLESCENT GIRLS AND WE FOUND
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50051 THEY FELT COMFORTABLE BEING CLOSE TO PEOPLE THEY COULD TRUST PEOPLE THEY WEREN'T WORRIED ABOUT BEING REJECTED
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50052 AND GIRLS WHO WERE MORE ROMANTICALLY COMPETENT WERE ENGAGING IN FEWER
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50053 ATYPICAL SEXUAL ACTIVITIES LIKE SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WHICH CAN BE CONSIDERED PRETTY RISKY FOR A
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50054 THEY'RE ALSO BETTER AT SEEKING AND PROVIDING SUPPORT TO THEIR PARTNERS
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50055 SO THEY ARE MORE WILLING TO ASK FOR WHAT THEY NEED AND USE WHAT THEIR PARTNERS GIVE THEM
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50056 AND THEY ARE BETTER AT PROVIDING HELPFUL SUPPORT WHEN NEEDED
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50057 THIS IS THE WORST THING EVER
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50058 AND THIS ISN'T JUST WHAT THEY TOLD US WE ACTUALLY OBSERVED THEM DOING THIS IN OUR LABORATORY WHERE WE ASKED THEM TO
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50059 AND THIS BRINGS ME BACK TO MY POINT THAT WE NEED TO BE TEACHING PEOPLE HOW TO HAVE HEALTHY
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50060 WE NEED TO HELP PEOPLE GENUINELY KNOW WHAT THEY WANT AND NEED IN A RELATIONSHIP
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50061 WE NEED TO HELP THEM SELECT THE RIGHT PARTNER
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50062 THIS IS WHAT THE NOTION OF ROMANTIC COMPETENCE IS ALL ABOUT
trainval/gh5VhaicC6g/50063 AND WOULDN'T ALL OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS BENEFIT FROM THIS
trainval/GhpFTQfiqCs/50001 NOBODY TAUGHT US HOW TO DEAL WITH SUCH KINDS OF DISABILITIES AND AS MANY QUESTIONS AS POSSIBLE STARTED TO
trainval/GhpFTQfiqCs/50002 AND THAT HAS BEEN REALLY A TOUGH TIME
trainval/GhpFTQfiqCs/50003 I MEAN AT THE END WILL HE BE ABLE TO WORK
trainval/GhpFTQfiqCs/50004 WILL HE BE ABLE TO BE NORMAL
trainval/GhpFTQfiqCs/50005 HONESTLY WE WENT DOWN
trainval/GhpFTQfiqCs/50007 AND THIS IS THE MESSAGE THAT WE WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU
trainval/gHxr8uJeqsg/50001 AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT OFTEN IS MISSING FROM POLITICAL ADVERTISING BECAUSE IN THE UNITED
trainval/GigYWy2UmOY/50001 I NEED TWO PEOPLE TO HELP ME OUT REAL QUICK
trainval/GigYWy2UmOY/50002 SHE COULD ALSO READ THE SERIAL NUMBERS ON BILLS WHEN THEY WERE PLACED FACE DOWN ON A HARD SURFACE
trainval/GigYWy2UmOY/50004 DO YOU UNDERSTAND
trainval/GigYWy2UmOY/50005 IT'S OK TO REMEMBER TO FORGET OR FORGET TO REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED
trainval/GigYWy2UmOY/50006 GIVE THEM A ROUND OF APPLAUSE AS THEY GO BACK TO THEIR SEATS
trainval/GIRDD1n6Pqs/50001 HE IS DANCING WITH HIS SHIRT OFF IN A CITY THAT I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO CLICK
trainval/GIRDD1n6Pqs/50002 I KNOW THAT ALLEY
trainval/GIt6Z0k3PQo/50001 SO THEY ARE ABLE TO DO IT IN THAT SENSE
trainval/GIt6Z0k3PQo/50002 IF THE PERSON DOESN'T FOLLOW DIRECTIONS THEY MAY END UP SHOOTING THEM AND THEN FIND OUT AFTERWARDS EITHER
trainval/GIt6Z0k3PQo/50003 SO AGAIN THEY'D SAY WITH ACCESS TO NONLETHAL WEAPONS IF WE'VE GOT SOMEONE WE KNOW IS HOSTILE WE CAN DO SOMETHING TO DEAL WITH THEM
trainval/GIt6Z0k3PQo/50004 SO YOU FEEL THIS MASSIVE HEAT AND YOU GO I WANT TO GET OUT OF THE WAY
trainval/GIt6Z0k3PQo/50005 SO I STARTED TO INVESTIGATE SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE WAY POLICE USE
trainval/GIt6Z0k3PQo/50006 IF AUSTRALIA HAD TO SEND 1000 PEOPLE TOMORROW TO WEST PAPUA FOR EXAMPLE WE DON'T HAVE
trainval/GIt6Z0k3PQo/50007 THE POLICE MINISTER'S AND A HEAP OF PUBLIC STATEMENTS WERE MADE ABOUT IT
trainval/GIt6Z0k3PQo/50009 ONE OF THOSE PROBLEMS IS
trainval/GIt6Z0k3PQo/50011 ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MILITARY USE OF FORCE IS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE DISCRIMINATE YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHO YOU'RE
trainval/GIt6Z0k3PQo/50012 THEY WERE HOLDING SOMETHING LIKE 700 PEOPLE HOSTAGE
trainval/GIt6Z0k3PQo/50013 THEY'D RELEASED A BUNCH OF PEOPLE BUT THEY STILL HAD ABOUT 700 PEOPLE HOSTAGE
trainval/GIt6Z0k3PQo/50014 THE WAY THEY DID IT WAS TO PUMP THE WHOLE THING FULL OF ANESTHETIC GAS
trainval/GIt6Z0k3PQo/50015 THAT YOU USE NONLETHAL WEAPONS FIRST SO YOUR LETHAL WEAPONS WILL ACTUALLY BE MORE EFFECTIVE
trainval/GIt6Z0k3PQo/50016 THE PEOPLE YOU'LL BE SHOOTING AT WON'T BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE WAY
trainval/GIt6Z0k3PQo/50018 I LOOKED AT IT
trainval/GIt6Z0k3PQo/50019 I WAS REALLY SURPRISED
trainval/GIt6Z0k3PQo/50020 SHE TOOK UP A MORE THREATENING POSITION IN HER BED
trainval/GIt6Z0k3PQo/50021 THEY'RE TRAINED TO BE MORE RESTRAINED IN THE USE OF FORCE THAN THE MILITARY ARE
trainval/GIt6Z0k3PQo/50022 SAME POLICE DISTRICT
trainval/GIt6Z0k3PQo/50023 THEY'RE TRAINED TO THINK MORE TO TRY AND DE ESCALATE
trainval/GIt6Z0k3PQo/50024 ANOTHER CHILD WITHIN WEEKS OF TASERING THE SIX YEAR OLD BOY
trainval/gIuhIo7mO5A/50001 THE THIRD IS THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE ON THIS PLANET STILL TO THIS DAY HAVE INSUFFICIENT ACCESS TO MEDICINES
trainval/gIuhIo7mO5A/50002 WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS THE OPIUM POPPY
trainval/gIuhIo7mO5A/50003 IT'S FROM THIS PLANT THAT WE GET MANY OF OUR MOST EFFECTIVE PAIN MEDICINES
trainval/Gj2pWl1vjCY/50001 I MEAN REMEMBER I CAME HERE TO PLAY SMART WILLFUL COMPLICATED INTERESTING
trainval/Gj2pWl1vjCY/50002 AND ALL OF THE SUDDEN I AM WRESTLING WITH 300 OTHER GORGEOUS TALENTED WOMEN TO PLAY
trainval/Gj2pWl1vjCY/50003 AND HE SAID YEAH
trainval/Gj2pWl1vjCY/50004 IT HAPPENS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE JUST TRYING TO GET ALONG WITHIN AN EXISTING SYSTEM
trainval/Gj2pWl1vjCY/50005 AND THIS REVOLUTION IS NOT JUST FOR WOMEN
trainval/Gj2pWl1vjCY/50006 JUST START THERE
trainval/Gj2pWl1vjCY/50007 WE NEED YOU TO BE VERY BRAVE
trainval/Gj2pWl1vjCY/50008 WRITE LETTERS TO ECCENTRIC RELATIVES
trainval/Gj2pWl1vjCY/50009 I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS BUT YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOUR MOVIES NOW TODAY FEATURES NOT
trainval/Gj2pWl1vjCY/50010 I WANT TO SEE WOMEN'S BODIES ON STAGE ON FILM THAT AREN'T PERFECT
trainval/gj3ZnKlHqxI/50001 A THOUGHTFUL EXPRESSION
trainval/gj3ZnKlHqxI/50002 WE CAN REMEMBER FACTS WE CAN REMEMBER ABSTRACT CONCEPT EVEN WHOLE TOPICS WITH
trainval/gj3ZnKlHqxI/50003 SO WE HAVE TO START GETTING USED TO THINKING IN PICTURES
trainval/gjCwsdCssdk/50001 AND IF WE WERE TO INTEGRATE A 2D AREA ON A 2D GRAPH WE WOULD USUALLY GET THE 3D VOLUME UNDER IT
trainval/gjCwsdCssdk/50002 SO FOLLOWING THE SAME PATTERN IF WE WERE TO INTEGRATE A 3D OBJECT WE WOULD GET A FOURTH
trainval/gjCwsdCssdk/50003 WE COMMONLY UNDERSTAND DIMENSIONS AS A THING OF THE SCIENCE FICTION
trainval/gjCwsdCssdk/50004 AND WHEN WE'RE ASKED WHAT THE FOURTH DIMENSION COULD BE WE'RE USUALLY MET WITH THE ANSWER OF IT IS TIME
trainval/gjCwsdCssdk/50005 AND PUT THEM INTO ONE SPECIFIC REEL
trainval/gjCwsdCssdk/50006 BUT BEFORE GOING TO 5D LET'S GO BACK TO A BIT OF CALCULUS
trainval/gjCwsdCssdk/50007 IF WE WERE TO INTEGRATE A 3D OBJECT WHAT DO WE GET
trainval/gjCwsdCssdk/50008 HOWEVER HOW MANY OF US ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT SUCH A THING MEANS
trainval/gjCwsdCssdk/50009 NO ONE REALLY KNOWS
trainval/gjCwsdCssdk/50010 WE CAN ONLY THEORIZE ABOUT THIS
trainval/gjCwsdCssdk/50011 THE STICKMAN FIGURE
trainval/gjCwsdCssdk/50012 WHAT WOULD HE HAVE TO DO
trainval/gjCwsdCssdk/50013 AND LET'S SAY HE DOES PUSH OUT OF THE PAPER
trainval/gjCwsdCssdk/50014 HOW DO YOU DO THIS
trainval/gjfYohXoiz0/50001 BUT WHAT EINSTEIN WAS SAYING
trainval/gjfYohXoiz0/50002 AND IT WAS ARTHUR STANLEY EDDINGTON'S EXPERIMENT OF SEEING THE BENDING OF LIGHT AROUND THE SUN
trainval/gjfYohXoiz0/50003 BUT WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING MORE SOPHISTICATED
trainval/gjfYohXoiz0/50004 WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE THE LIGHT BEND CONTINUOUSLY RATHER THAN SUDDENLY AND THAT MEANS NOT A SUDDEN
trainval/gjfYohXoiz0/50005 THERE'S NO CHANGE
trainval/gjfYohXoiz0/50006 IT'S VERY HIGHLY REFLECTING
trainval/gjfYohXoiz0/50007 I HAVE JUST TIME TO TELL YOU ABOUT THREE OF THEM VERY BRIEFLY
trainval/gjfYohXoiz0/50008 OF COURSE MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING WORKS THROUGH A MAGNETIC SIGNAL SO THAT'S A WAY OF
trainval/gjfYohXoiz0/50009 TERAHERTZ RADIATION IS INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT
trainval/GjINFuwLGvQ/50001 SO WHY ARE WE DISCOVERING UNACCEPTABLE SIDE EFFECTS ON HALF THE POPULATION AFTER THAT
trainval/GjINFuwLGvQ/50002 SO SOME MUCH NEEDED GUIDELINES OR RULES WERE SET INTO PLACE AND PART OF THAT WAS THIS DESIRE
trainval/GjINFuwLGvQ/50003 WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THAT THE MEDICAL SCIENCE DISCOVERED OVER THE PAST CENTURY HAS BEEN BASED
trainval/GjINFuwLGvQ/50004 WOMEN'S HEALTH BECAME SYNONYMOUS WITH REPRODUCTION
trainval/GjINFuwLGvQ/50005 BUT MORE WOMEN DIE WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR OF HAVING A HEART ATTACK THAN MEN
trainval/GjINFuwLGvQ/50006 GENDER IS HOW SOMEONE PRESENTS THEMSELVES IN SOCIETY
trainval/GjINFuwLGvQ/50007 THIS NEW KNOWLEDGE IS THE GAME CHANGER AND
trainval/gjq2BoAF0JA/50001 BUT IT JUST REALLY GOES TO SHOW THAT SOMETIMES THE BEST SOLUTIONS ARE THE SIMPLEST SOLUTIONS
trainval/gjq2BoAF0JA/50002 AND SO THE QUESTION I ASK ALL OF YOU TODAY IS WHY WAIT
trainval/gJv1WdMUz0w/50001 WE ARE PART OF SPIRIT GRANDMOTHER AND GRANDFATHER
trainval/gJv1WdMUz0w/50002 AND SLEEPILY WE'D GET BACK IN THE CAR AND GO BACK TO THE CITY
trainval/gJv1WdMUz0w/50003 AND I REALIZED HOW BLESSED I WAS TO HAVE HIM IN MY LIFE
trainval/gJv1WdMUz0w/50004 WE'D PULL UP IN FRONT OF MY AUNT AND UNCLE'S HOUSE WITH ITS WHITE WOODED SIDING
trainval/gJv1WdMUz0w/50005 SO WE HAD TO HUG EVERYBODY BEFORE WE WENT OUTSIDE TO PLAY
trainval/gJv1WdMUz0w/50006 THE SAPARA FREELY PROVIDE THEIR TREATMENTS TO ANYONE THE
trainval/gJv1WdMUz0w/50007 FOR MILES THEY TRAVEL TO CUT THE TREES DOWN TO BUILD THEIR HOMES
trainval/gJv1WdMUz0w/50008 AND WHY I IMAGE THE WINDS IS BECAUSE THEY REMIND ME OF OUR CONNECTION TO EVERYTHING AS
trainval/gJv1WdMUz0w/50009 IT'S FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
trainval/GJWSZgjz7G0/50001 NOW THE EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENT AGENCY ESTIMATES THAT THE ECONOMIC LOSSES CAUSED BY
trainval/GJWSZgjz7G0/50002 OK SO LET'S BEGIN
trainval/GJWSZgjz7G0/50003 THERE ARE BIRDS EVERYWHERE
trainval/GJWSZgjz7G0/50004 ITS PAWS ARE NOT WELL ADAPTED TO PADDLING
trainval/GJWSZgjz7G0/50005 IT DOESN'T TELL US THAT MUCH ABOUT PARTICULAR BEHAVIORS APART FROM THE FACT THAT AN ANIMAL WAS
trainval/GJWSZgjz7G0/50006 AND HOW COLD THE WATER IS
trainval/GJWSZgjz7G0/50007 SO ON ONE HAND THAT TELLS US THAT THEY'RE VERY VERY WELL ADAPTED TO HANDLING COLD TEMPERATURES
trainval/GJWSZgjz7G0/50008 BECAUSE IF THEY HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT FISHING THEY WOULD ONLY NEED ONE OR TWO DIVES THEY'D DIVE IN THEY'D CATCH A
trainval/GJWSZgjz7G0/50009 ALL OF THESE ANIMALS ARE SUPREMELY ADAPTABLE THEY'RE VERSATILE THEY'RE RESILIENT THEY DO
trainval/GjYt5uQPu8o/50001 WE HAD NO MONEY AT ALL
trainval/GKjScLeyNJk/50001 SECOND WE WANT TO SUPPORT YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE BEGINNING THEIR CAREERS AND ARE INTERESTED IN THE
trainval/GKjScLeyNJk/50002 ORG AND SIGN UP
trainval/GKjScLeyNJk/50003 WHAT WILL BE YOUR ROLE
trainval/GKjScLeyNJk/50004 SCIENCE FICTION IS NOT SO FAR FROM BECOMING SCIENCE FACT
trainval/gkKymhU7yi0/50001 ALL POWER COMES FROM THE UNIVERSE THAT SURROUNDS THEM
trainval/gkKymhU7yi0/50002 AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE
trainval/gkKymhU7yi0/50003 IN IT WE SEE SUPERMAN RUSHING OUT GRABBING A CAR THAT'S FULL OF
trainval/GkRn9Lp16UI/50001 IT'S THE VERY LATEST STUDY I DOWNLOADED IT THIS AFTERNOON I HAVEN'T YET READ IT
trainval/GkRn9Lp16UI/50003 THE WOMEN'S PERSONALITY WITH THE SLIGHTLY LOWER SELF ESTEEM WITH SLIGHTLY MORE ANXIOUSNESS MEANS THAT WHEN THEY'RE TAKING
trainval/GkRn9Lp16UI/50004 AND THAT BECOMES THE EXPLANATION
trainval/GkRn9Lp16UI/50005 THAT ARE PARTICULARLY LOOKED AT NOT DUE TO THE TEST BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE CORRELATES OF INTELLIGENCE
trainval/GkRn9Lp16UI/50006 WRONG IN EDINBURGH
trainval/GkRn9Lp16UI/50007 AND YOUR GRANDMOTHER
trainval/GkRn9Lp16UI/50008 HOW OLD ARE THEY
trainval/GkRn9Lp16UI/50009 BLAH BLAH BLAH
trainval/GkRn9Lp16UI/50011 AND WHAT PERMISSION DO YOU HAVE TO BE BRIGHT
trainval/GkRn9Lp16UI/50012 AND YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/gLdBqrTOQxc/50001 ANOTHER SMALL YET A VERY BIG THING HAPPENED TO ME WHEN MY SON LUCAS WAS BORN
trainval/gLDQr9i7LkM/50001 YOU SAY I HAVE A RESPIRATORY VIRUS
trainval/gLDQr9i7LkM/50002 LET'S STOP THIS HYPOTHETICAL FOR A SECOND
trainval/gLDQr9i7LkM/50003 THE SECOND WAY THAT THEY DO THIS IS THEY DO IT IN MOMENTS WHERE GOOD MEDICINE HAS PROVED
trainval/gLDQr9i7LkM/50004 TAKE SEPTEMBER 11TH 2001 IN NEW YORK CITY ONE OF THE WORST TERRORIST ATTACKS OF ALL
trainval/gLDQr9i7LkM/50005 YOUR MIND DOES NOT RESPOND WELL TO STRESS
trainval/gLDQr9i7LkM/50006 A MARKETER'S JOB IS TO SELL PRODUCT OR TO PUSH A BRAND AND THEY DO
trainval/gLDQr9i7LkM/50007 LOOK I GET IT
trainval/gLDQr9i7LkM/50008 WE LIVE IN A FAST PACED WORLD
trainval/gLDQr9i7LkM/50009 SOMETHING WE ALL DRINK EVERY DAY
trainval/gLDQr9i7LkM/50010 THAT IS WHAT OUR JOB AS A TRUE EXPERT IS
trainval/gLDQr9i7LkM/50011 A DOCTOR PRESCRIBES A TREATMENT OR TELLS YOU NOT TO GO FOR A TREATMENT
trainval/gLDQr9i7LkM/50012 ASK HEY DOC WHY DO I NEED THESE ANTIBIOTICS
trainval/gLDQr9i7LkM/50013 IN 1981 THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHED A STUDY THAT SAID TWO CUPS OF COFFEE
trainval/gLDQr9i7LkM/50014 DO I EVEN NEED THESE ANTIBIOTICS
trainval/gLDQr9i7LkM/50015 OFTENTIMES THESE IKA EXPERTS WILL TOUT A SINGLE STUDY AND TRY
trainval/gLDQr9i7LkM/50016 SO IT'S YOUR JOB TO BE AWARE OF THIS RESEARCH
trainval/gLDQr9i7LkM/50017 AND HERE I'LL TELL YOU HOW TO DO THAT
trainval/gLDQr9i7LkM/50018 KNOW THAT THE BEST FORM OF RESEARCH IS A METAANALYSIS
trainval/gLDQr9i7LkM/50019 IT'S A COMBINATION OF STUDIES NOT JUST ONE WHICH ALLOWS FOR THE DECREASED LIKELIHOOD OF
trainval/gLDQr9i7LkM/50020 NOTE THAT NEWER STUDIES ARE NOT NECESSARILY BETTER THAN OLDER STUDIES
trainval/gLDQr9i7LkM/50021 IT CAN GUIDE US IT CAN PUT ITSELF INTO THE CONTEXT OF THE ENTIRE BODY OF EVIDENCE
trainval/gLDQr9i7LkM/50022 WE USED TO BELIEVE THAT BLOODLETTING A
trainval/gLgNjywpKsY/50001 SF ALSO GIVES SHAPE AND FORM TO PEOPLE
trainval/GlpGBSBpxOE/50002 IN ORDER FOR US TO GET MAXIMUM VALUE FROM OUR TIME AND OUR LIFE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND OUR
trainval/GlpGBSBpxOE/50003 LIVING IN ACCORDANCE WITH YOUR HIGHEST VALUES MEANS LIVING BY WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY
trainval/GlpGBSBpxOE/50004 ANYTHING THAT WAS A VOID WHEN YOU GREW UP YOU END UP DOING EVERYTHING TO AVOID IN YOUR ADULT LIFE
trainval/GlpGBSBpxOE/50005 LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
trainval/GlpGBSBpxOE/50006 ANOTHER WAY TO ELICIT ONE OF YOUR HIGHEST VALUES IS TO LOOK AT WHERE YOU SPEND INVEST YOUR
trainval/GlpGBSBpxOE/50007 WHAT KIND OF BOOKS DO YOU MOST LIKE TO READ
trainval/GlpGBSBpxOE/50008 WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE DO YOU LOVE SPENDING TIME WITH
trainval/GlpGBSBpxOE/50009 THIS IS THE END
trainval/GlpGBSBpxOE/50010 SO RATHER THAN RANDOMLY PICKING FROM THE LOT GET CLEAR ON WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY THEN GO FIND SOMEONE THAT IS IN ALIGNMENT
trainval/GlpGBSBpxOE/50011 NOW IS YOUR TIME
trainval/GlUS6KE67Vs/50002 THEY LEARN SOMETHING THEY PUT IT BACK INTO THE PRODUCT THEY PUT IT BACK INTO THE MARKET
trainval/GlUS6KE67Vs/50003 THEY HAVE A WHOLE TEAM CALLED KNOWLEDGE AND INSIGHT
trainval/GlUS6KE67Vs/50004 IT'S A LOT LIKE OTHER CONSUMER COMPANIES
trainval/GlUS6KE67Vs/50005 THEY SET THEM UP AS WHAT THEY CALLED MICRO DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND THOSE LOCAL ENTREPRENEURS THEN HIRE
trainval/GlUS6KE67Vs/50006 WELL THEY'RE ALREADY STARTING TALK ABOUT THIS
trainval/GlUS6KE67Vs/50007 COKE'S GLOBAL CAMPAIGN SLOGAN IS OPEN HAPPINESS
trainval/GlUS6KE67Vs/50008 BUT THEY LOCALIZE IT
trainval/GlUS6KE67Vs/50009 NOW THAT PLAYED ITSELF OUT IN THE WORLD CUP CAMPAIGN
trainval/GlUS6KE67Vs/50010 NOW IT COULD HAVE COME FROM ONE OF TWO PLACES
trainval/GlUS6KE67Vs/50011 LET'S LISTEN TO THIS SONG THAT COKE CREATED FOR IT WAVIN' FLAG BY A SOMALI HIP HOP ARTIST
trainval/GlUS6KE67Vs/50012 AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY ONLY ONE OTHER PERSON IN THAT AREA GOT POLIO
trainval/GlUS6KE67Vs/50013 THE G8 NATIONS HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY GENEROUS ON POLIO OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS BUT WE'RE STARTING TO HAVE
trainval/GMc8aSoCE30/50001 EVERYONE HAS MORE
trainval/GMc8aSoCE30/50002 JUST THINK ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW THAT STARTED A BUSINESS AND FAILED
trainval/GMc8aSoCE30/50004 DID YOU JUST FEEL IT
trainval/GMc8aSoCE30/50006 WE GAVE THEM OUR GAME AS A TRAINING TOOL AND WE CREATED A COLLABORATIVE QUEST
trainval/gmjSazFbpkA/50001 HARPER TELLS PEOPLE MY MOM WON'T BE THERE BUT YOU CAN TEXT MY NANNY
trainval/gmjSazFbpkA/50002 I COULDN'T RESTART THE ENGINE
trainval/gmjSazFbpkA/50003 I'M NOT PERFECT AT IT BUT I TRY HARD TO PRACTICE IT
trainval/gmjSazFbpkA/50004 I CREATE TELEVISION
trainval/gmjSazFbpkA/50005 I EXECUTIVE PRODUCE TELEVISION
trainval/gmjSazFbpkA/50006 I MAKE TELEVISION A GREAT DEAL OF TELEVISION
trainval/gmjSazFbpkA/50007 IT IS PAINTING A CANVAS
trainval/gmjSazFbpkA/50008 IT IS HITTING EVERY HIGH NOTE
trainval/gmjSazFbpkA/50009 IT IS RUNNING A MARATHON
trainval/gmjSazFbpkA/50010 IT IS BEING BEYONC
trainval/gmjSazFbpkA/50011 I LOVE WORKING
trainval/gmjSazFbpkA/50012 THERE IS SOME KIND OF SHIFT INSIDE ME WHEN THE WORK GETS GOOD
trainval/gmjSazFbpkA/50013 THE HUM IS ACTION AND ACTIVITY
trainval/gmjSazFbpkA/50014 THE HUM IS A DRUG
trainval/gmjSazFbpkA/50015 THE HUM IS MUSIC
trainval/gmjSazFbpkA/50016 WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN
trainval/gmjSazFbpkA/50017 AND YET IT IS EXTRAORDINARY BECAUSE IN MY PAIN AND MY PANIC IN THE HOMELESSNESS OF
trainval/gmjSazFbpkA/50018 THE REAL HUM IS CONFIDENCE AND PEACE
trainval/gmjSazFbpkA/50019 THE REAL HUM IS GOD'S WHISPER IN MY EAR BUT MAYBE GOD WAS WHISPERING THE WRONG WORDS BECAUSE WHICH ONE OF THE GODS WAS TELLING
trainval/gmjSazFbpkA/50020 BUT IT IS OK
trainval/gmjSazFbpkA/50021 I PLAY AND I PLAY UNTIL I BEGIN TO WONDER WHY WE EVER STOP PLAYING IN THE FIRST PLACE
trainval/gmjSazFbpkA/50022 I DON'T NEED THAT HUM
trainval/gmjSazFbpkA/50023 I AM NOT THAT HUM
trainval/gmjSazFbpkA/50024 I AM THAT HUM
trainval/gmjSazFbpkA/50025 MY BRAIN IS STILL GLOBAL
trainval/gmjSazFbpkA/50026 THE MORE I PLAY THE BETTER I WORK
trainval/gmn7tjSNyAA/50001 WE ARE NOW REPLICATING THIS IN A 1
trainval/gMNlRovT5x4/50001 ALCIDE WAS DRIVING AND HE WAS DRUNK AND HE DROVE OFF THE ROAD AND HIT A TELEGRAPH POLE
trainval/gMNlRovT5x4/50002 HE HAD NO UNDERSTANDING AT THAT TIME WHAT WAS GOING ON
trainval/gMNlRovT5x4/50003 NOW RICKY LIKE MY FATHER RICKY WAS A VERY INTELLIGENT GUY
trainval/gMNlRovT5x4/50004 BUT THIS WAS EASY RIGHT
trainval/GmSfwNFkNJ8/50001 THEY HAVE TROUBLE IN SCHOOL THEY CAN'T FIND THEIR GROUP OF FRIENDS AND THEY GO WITHIN THEIR OWN BUBBLE
trainval/GmSfwNFkNJ8/50002 AND SOME PEOPLE PLAY IT COOL
trainval/GmSfwNFkNJ8/50003 THEY HAVE GREAT GRADES AND THAT'S WHAT MATTERS RIGHT
trainval/GmSfwNFkNJ8/50004 I WAS THE GIRL WHO STRUGGLED ACADEMICALLY DUE TO MANY LEARNING DIFFERENCES EVEN THOUGH I WOULD TRY SO
trainval/GmSfwNFkNJ8/50005 I WAS UNDERMINED AND I WAS MISERABLE ABOUT MYSELF BUT THE ONE THING I DID HAVE WAS AN ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT I HAD
trainval/GmSfwNFkNJ8/50006 I FELT LIKE I WAS IN A DARK HOLE THAT WAS GETTING WORSE AND WORSE AS EACH DAY WENT BY
trainval/GmSfwNFkNJ8/50007 FOR MANY OF US IT'S THE TOUGHEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES
trainval/GmSfwNFkNJ8/50008 GIRLS AREN'T ALWAYS NICE TO EACH OTHER WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK OR AT LEAST WE THINK SO WE'RE VERY INSECURE AND WE'RE
trainval/GmSfwNFkNJ8/50009 PEOPLE REACT TO THESE MIDDLE SCHOOL YEARS IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS
trainval/GmSfwNFkNJ8/50010 YOU CAN'T AVOID IT
trainval/GmSfwNFkNJ8/50011 FOR SOME GIRLS PUBERTY'S IN THEIR FAVOR
trainval/GmSfwNFkNJ8/50012 THIS WILL PASS
trainval/GmSfwNFkNJ8/50013 TAKE THOSE LEMONS AND MAKE THE MOST KILLER LEMONADE YOU CAN
trainval/GmSfwNFkNJ8/50014 THEY HAVE THEIR CLIQUE
trainval/GmSfwNFkNJ8/50015 THEY HAVE GREAT GRADES
trainval/GmSfwNFkNJ8/50016 THEY'RE HAPPY AND THEY'LL SHOW IT
trainval/gmSsyvrI2Xw/50001 I THINK HE DOESN'T LIKE ME
trainval/gmSsyvrI2Xw/50003 ARE YOU RELIABLE
trainval/gniDHWq0RSQ/50001 WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE FATE OF THE UNIVERSE
trainval/gniDHWq0RSQ/50002 AND THAT MEANS LOOK FAR AWAY
trainval/gObgox0tfgw/50001 IN OUR STUDY WE LOOKED AT
trainval/gObgox0tfgw/50002 AND WHILE THERE IS LARGE INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY WE SEE THIS STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN READING
trainval/gObgox0tfgw/50003 IN OTHER WORDS THE POORER THE PERFORMANCE IN READING OR MORE DYSLEXIC YOU WERE THE HIGHER PERFORMANCE IN
trainval/gObgox0tfgw/50004 SO THERE MUST BE SOME EVOLUTIONARY ADVANTAGE OF HAVING DYSLEXIA
trainval/gObgox0tfgw/50005 UNTIL MORE RESEARCH IS DONE WE DON'T HAVE AN EXACT ANSWER
trainval/GOCUH7TxHRI/50001 AND THAT PROBLEM IS HOW IS IT SO EASY TO KNOW OTHER MINDS
trainval/GOCUH7TxHRI/50002 SO FIRST THE FIRST THING I WANT TO TELL YOU IS THAT THERE IS A BRAIN REGION IN THE HUMAN BRAIN IN YOUR BRAINS WHOSE
trainval/GOCUH7TxHRI/50003 THIS IS A PICTURE OF IT
trainval/GOCUH7TxHRI/50004 SO THIS BRAIN REGION IS CALLED THE RIGHT TPJ
trainval/GOCUH7TxHRI/50005 IT TAKES CHILDREN A LONG TIME TO BREAK INTO THE SYSTEM
trainval/GOCUH7TxHRI/50006 I NEED A DRINK WITH MY LUNCH
trainval/GOCUH7TxHRI/50007 RS THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT
trainval/GOCUH7TxHRI/50008 BUT THE POWDER IS LABELED DEADLY POISON SO GRACE THINKS THAT THE POWDER IS A DEADLY POISON
trainval/GOCUH7TxHRI/50010 THIS IS A TOOL THAT LETS US PASS A MAGNETIC PULSE THROUGH SOMEBODY'S SKULL INTO A SMALL REGION OF THEIR BRAIN
trainval/GOCUH7TxHRI/50011 AND WE CAN USE THAT SAME PULSE NOW APPLIED TO THE RTPJ TO ASK IF WE CAN CHANGE PEOPLE'S MORAL
trainval/GOCUH7TxHRI/50012 THIS SYSTEM TAKES A LONG TIME TO DEVELOP SLOWLY THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF CHILDHOOD AND INTO EARLY ADOLESCENCE
trainval/GOCUH7TxHRI/50013 IT'S GETTING THEM WRONG THAT IS LIVING
trainval/GOCUH7TxHRI/50014 ONE IS THAT YOU CAN'T BE TMSED WITHOUT KNOWING IT
trainval/GOCUH7TxHRI/50015 SO IT'S NOT A SURREPTITIOUS TECHNOLOGY
trainval/GOCUH7TxHRI/50016 IT'S QUITE HARD ACTUALLY TO GET THOSE VERY SMALL CHANGES
trainval/GOCUH7TxHRI/50017 THE CHANGES I SHOWED YOU ARE IMPRESSIVE TO ME BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY TELL US ABOUT THE FUNCTION OF THE BRAIN BUT THEY'RE SMALL
trainval/GOCUH7TxHRI/50018 AND WHAT WE CHANGED WAS NOT PEOPLE'S MORAL JUDGMENTS WHEN THEY'RE DECIDING WHAT TO DO WHEN THEY'RE MAKING ACTION
trainval/GOCUH7TxHRI/50019 WE CHANGED THEIR ABILITY TO JUDGE OTHER PEOPLE'S ACTIONS
trainval/GOCUH7TxHRI/50020 AND SO I THINK OF WHAT I'M DOING NOT SO MUCH AS STUDYING THE DEFENDANT IN A CRIMINAL TRIAL BUT STUDYING THE JURY
trainval/GOCUH7TxHRI/50021 WHY DOES IT SEEM TO REQUIRE THESE BEINGS WHO SENSE THINGS FOR US TO OPERATE
trainval/golS4kh8ETY/50001 IN THE EARLY 21ST CENTURY WE'RE MAKING SPACE FOR THE BIG BANG IN AMONGST WHAT WE TELL OUR CHILDREN
trainval/golS4kh8ETY/50003 ON EINSTEIN'S UNIVERSE WE HAVE SPACETIME
trainval/goSQOzc79Uc/50002 I'M NOT SLAGGING THEM OFF
trainval/goSQOzc79Uc/50003 IT'S IN EVERYTHING
trainval/goYIHXKvwLk/50001 SO WE HAD TO THINK ABOUT IS THERE A MORE GENERAL WAY IN WHICH WE CAN START TO UNDERSTAND THE WORLD AND MAKE A VISUAL FIELD
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50001 IT'S LIKE A ZEN THING FOR CARDS
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50004 I REALLY WISH MY GRANDSON WERE HERE TO SEE YOU PERFORM
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50005 AND MAYBE HER GRANDSON HAS A PROPENSITY FOR QUANTUM MECHANICS OR AN INTEREST IN HUGH EVERETT'S MULTIPLE WORLD
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50006 SO WHY DO WE AS ADULTS RESPOND THIS WAY TO MAGIC
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50007 IT WASN'T THAT IT WASN'T FOR KIDS IT JUST WASN'T EXCLUSIVELY FOR KIDS
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50008 IF THE LARGE PORTION OF THE WORLD SEES MAGIC FOR THE FIRST TIME ON TV AND SAYS THIS IS FOR KIDS THOSE KIDS MIGHT GROW UP
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50009 AND YET AS MAGICIANS WE USE THE TERM TO FOOL WHEN IT COMES TO A MAGIC TRICK THAT SUCCESSFULLY WORKS RIGHT
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50010 WE LOOK TO SOMEONE THAT SOCIETALLY IS ACCEPTABLE TO FOOL A CHILD
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50011 WELL A CHILD DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH LIFE EXPERIENCE AS I DO
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50012 SO OF COURSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE MORE AMUSED MORE AMAZED AND IT'S OK FOR THE KID TO LIKE MAGIC TRICKS
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50013 AND THAT IS I THINK A GOOD MAGIC TRICK INSTILLS OR CAN INSTILL A SENSE OF CHILDLIKE WONDER
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50014 YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE OBJECT PERMANENCE
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50015 THEY'RE ALSO NOT AFRAID OF BEING WRONG AND NOT KNOWING HOW SOMETHING WORKS RIGHT AWAY
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50016 TO A PERSON WHO STILL BELIEVES IN SANTA CLAUS OR THE TOOTH FAIRY A WELL EXECUTED CARD TRICK MIGHT NOT BE QUITE AS
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50017 WHEN THE CARDS ARE IN ORDER MY THOUGHTS ARE IN ORDER
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50018 IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT SHE IS NOT BY ANY MEANS A VENTRILOQUIST
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50019 CARDS PREFER TO BE IN THIS ORDERLY STATE OF TRANQUILITY
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50020 CURIOSITY IS THE CATALYST FOR PROGRESS
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50021 HE HAD THREE RULES OF PREDICTIONS
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50022 WE NEED THESE FOR SURVIVAL AND SANITY
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50023 THE TRICKSTER'S AN IMPORTANT CHARACTER
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50024 WHAT WE'LL DO IS USE YOUR IMAGINATION
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50025 I'LL PRETEND TO AMAZE YOU YOU PRETEND TO BE AMAZED WE ALL GO HOME HAPPY
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50026 IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE FOR ALL THREE COINS TO DISAPPEAR
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50027 BUT IMAGINE THE FIRST COIN
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50028 THAT'S THE ASSUMPTION I'M GOING TO WORK UNDER AND TRY TO USE THAT AGAINST YOUR OWN ASSUMPTION
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50030 JERRY ANDRUS SAID THIS BEAUTIFULLY
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50031 IF YOU THINK ABOUT COMMONPLACE TECHNOLOGY LIKE A HELICOPTER OR A SUBMARINE THINGS WE ALL KNOW RIGHT NOW THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50032 FIRST OFF THAT PEOPLE THINK THAT THE MORE THEY KNOW THE HARDER THEY ARE TO FOOL
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50033 ACTUALLY IT'S THE OPPOSITE
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50034 THE MORE YOU THINK YOU KNOW THE EASIER IT IS FOR ME AS A MAGICIAN TO FOOL YOU
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50035 I'LL ILLUSTRATE THAT WITH ANOTHER COMMENT WE GET A LOT AND THAT IS BOY I BET IT'S REALLY EASY TO FOOL A DRUNK PERSON
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50036 THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY ABLE TO SEE WHAT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50037 THEY KNOW WHAT'S IN FRONT OF THEM THEY'LL FOCUS HERE
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50038 AS FOR ME AS A MAGICIAN I'M NOT OUT HERE TRYING TO BE THIS WHIMSICAL SILLY LITTLE MAGICIAN TRYING TO GET YOU TO BELIEVE
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50039 YOU WANT TO SEE HOW THIS WORKS
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50040 THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50041 I SHOULDN'T BE SHOWING YOU THIS BUT
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50042 I'LL DO IT VISUALLY
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50043 EVERYONE'S SAYING UP THE SLEEVE
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50044 IT'S MISDIRECTION EVERYONE'S WATCHING THE COIN
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50045 COME ON I LIE FOR A LIVING IT'S MY JOB
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50046 BUT I'M NICE ABOUT IT I TELL YOU I'M GOING TO LIE THEN I DO
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50047 IF I PUT MY HAND OVER THE COIN AND I'D ASK YOU CAN YOU SEE THE COIN
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50048 YOU'D OBVIOUSLY SAY NO
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50049 AND THAT WAS PRETTY LOUD
trainval/GOZOhpxSAFI/50050 WE'RE DOWN TO ONE
trainval/GP4sBGbeF8w/50002 PROBLEM NUMBER ONE UNEMPLOYMENT
trainval/GP4sBGbeF8w/50003 NOW YOU KNOW MORE OR LESS WHAT IT IS
trainval/GP4sBGbeF8w/50004 SUPPOSE WE HAVE SUCH AN UNCONDITIONAL BASIC INCOME
trainval/GP4sBGbeF8w/50005 PARTLY BECAUSE THEY WILL HAVE BEEN VACATED BY THE PEOPLE WORKING TOO MUCH BUT ALSO BECAUSE THEY CAN COMBINE THESE
trainval/GP4sBGbeF8w/50006 THAT SOLVES THE PROBLEM OF UNEMPLOYMENT
trainval/GP4sBGbeF8w/50007 WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER PROBLEM THIS RADICAL ALTERNATIVE TO CAPITALISM AS WE KNOW IT
trainval/GP4sBGbeF8w/50008 BASIC INCOME IS NOT THE WHOLE OF IT BUT IT IS AN ESSENTIAL
trainval/gPEECGFJFb8/50001 THROUGHOUT THESE AND THE MANY OTHER JOURNEYS THAT AWAIT THIS AFTERNOON WE INVITE YOU TO CONSIDER YOUR OWN DREAMS AS
trainval/gPEECGFJFb8/50002 TO ME DREAMS ARE THE WORLD'S MOST IMMERSIVE AND FANTASTIC MOVIES WITH PRIVATE SHOWINGS EVERY NIGHT
trainval/gPEECGFJFb8/50003 DREAMS LET US ESCAPE THE RESTRICTIONS OF OUR PHYSICAL WORLD
trainval/gPEECGFJFb8/50004 EACH DREAM IS A SAUNTER THROUGH AN ENDLESS SANDBOX OUR OWN WILD WEST WITH NOTHING HOLDING US BACK
trainval/gPEECGFJFb8/50005 AND THIS IS JUST WHAT MAKES DREAMS SO INTERESTING SO EXCITING WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL HARNESSES
trainval/GpKrM8GQwOg/50001 LET NETFLIX THINK AND ACT FOR YOU
trainval/GpKrM8GQwOg/50002 IS THIS WHAT WE WANT
trainval/GpKrM8GQwOg/50003 WHAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON SPECIFICALLY IS WHAT I SEE AS THE DOMINANT TREND IN TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION TODAY
trainval/GpKrM8GQwOg/50004 HERE'S THE PROBLEM
trainval/GpKrM8GQwOg/50005 RESPONSIBILITY IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU DO
trainval/GpKrM8GQwOg/50006 IT'S SOMETHING YOU ARE
trainval/gPQItVxvfZs/50002 IF ANYBODY IN TOHOKU WANTS TO START MANUFACTURING THIS WE WOULD ACTUALLY HELP THEM
trainval/gpSnhBdsKE4/50001 TAKE FOR EXAMPLE ZIMBABWE
trainval/GqGksNRYu8s/50001 I'M ON THIS BIG RED CIRCLE
trainval/GqGksNRYu8s/50002 YOU CAN OPEN YOUR EYES NOW
trainval/GqGksNRYu8s/50003 DOES THE WAY WE BUILD TRUST FACE TO FACE TRANSLATE ONLINE
trainval/GqGksNRYu8s/50004 I WOULD GET A BAD REPUTATION AND YOU WOULD REFUSE TO DO BUSINESS WITH ME IN THE FUTURE
trainval/GqGksNRYu8s/50005 I AM NOT SAYING WE DO NOT NEED HOTELS OR TRADITIONAL FORMS OF AUTHORITY
trainval/GqGksNRYu8s/50006 SO THE ECONOMIST ELOQUENTLY DESCRIBED THE BLOCKCHAIN AS THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
trainval/GqGksNRYu8s/50007 THAT'S 127 RIDES PER SECOND SHOWING THAT THIS IS A CROSS CULTURAL
trainval/gqpErbFnbiY/50001 ONE IS THE MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME AND THE MITOCHONDRIA ARE THE ORGANELLES IN THE CELL THAT MAKE ENERGY
trainval/gqpErbFnbiY/50002 THAT WOULD BE VERY EMBARRASSING
trainval/gqpErbFnbiY/50003 AND THAT'S HAPPENED BEFORE
trainval/gqpErbFnbiY/50004 DIED UNFORTUNATELY 2 DAYS LATER
trainval/gqpErbFnbiY/50006 THERE ARE OTHER SPECIES
trainval/gQShmD0C81U/50001 OR A GAME OF THRONES MARATHON TONIGHT
trainval/gQShmD0C81U/50002 WHILE PROCRASTINATING ON WRITING AN ESSAY YOU STUDY FOR YOUR MATH TEST
trainval/GRcvxDVDLCw/50001 AND IT'S NOT JUST ALZHEIMER'S
trainval/GRcvxDVDLCw/50002 THE PROBLEM IS THOUGH THAT PROTEINS DON'T ALWAYS FOLD PROPERLY
trainval/GRcvxDVDLCw/50003 WHY THEN DO CELLS EVER HAVE PROBLEMS
trainval/GRcvxDVDLCw/50004 I ALSO PROMISED I WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT CANCER
trainval/GRcvxDVDLCw/50005 OK SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM
trainval/GRcvxDVDLCw/50006 AND WE COULD HAVE A WAY OF CANCER SELF DESTRUCTING
trainval/GROCkg810R0/50001 AND SO WITH FLIGHT IT'S VERY METABOLICALLY COSTLY
trainval/GROCkg810R0/50002 WE'RE A LITTLE FRIGHTENED BY THINGS THAT CAN PERCEIVE THE WORLD SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY THAN US
trainval/GROCkg810R0/50003 NOW AS I SAID BEFORE BATS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR OUR ECOSYSTEMS TO FUNCTION CORRECTLY
trainval/GROCkg810R0/50004 SO INDEED WE NEED THEM FOR OUR ECOSYSTEMS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY
trainval/GROCkg810R0/50005 IT'S WORKING ITS WAY SLOWLY ACROSS THE U
trainval/GROCkg810R0/50006 BY THEIR ATTRACTION TO WIND FARMS
trainval/GROCkg810R0/50007 EVOLUTION ACTS AS A SIEVE
trainval/GROCkg810R0/50008 SO SAY FOR EXAMPLE THE REGION OF THE GENOME THAT I WAS LOOKING AT WAS A REGION THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR VISION
trainval/GROCkg810R0/50009 IF WE LOOK AT THAT REGION IN MAMMALS THAT DON'T SEE SO WELL SUCH AS BATS AND WE FIND THAT
trainval/GROCkg810R0/50010 THINK OF A MOUSE
trainval/GROCkg810R0/50011 BUT BATS ARE VERY DIFFERENT
trainval/GROCkg810R0/50012 AND HOPEFULLY IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS I'LL BE GIVING YOU A TEDTALK ON THAT
trainval/GROCkg810R0/50013 AND THE REALITY IS THAT BATS CAN BRING US SO MUCH BENEFIT IF WE JUST LOOK IN THE RIGHT
trainval/grtGI7QpPdw/50001 BUT MY EXAMPLE OF IT IS A SIGN THAT I SAW IN A JEWELRY STORE
trainval/GS1xL1qcBa4/50001 SO ANOTHER WAY TO THINK ABOUT TECHNOLOGY WHAT IT MEANS IS TO IMAGINE A WORLD WITHOUT TECHNOLOGY
trainval/GS1xL1qcBa4/50002 WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE
trainval/GS1xL1qcBa4/50003 AND IF YOU GO THERE YOU SAY HEY EVERYBODY'S REALLY HEALTHY
trainval/GS1xL1qcBa4/50004 SAME THING WITH THE HUNTER GATHERER TRIBES AND EARLY MAN YOU DIDN'T LIVE BEYOND THE AGE OF 30
trainval/GS1xL1qcBa4/50005 IT WAS A VERY SHORT LIFE
trainval/GS1xL1qcBa4/50006 I THINK THAT REALLY LEADS NOWHERE
trainval/GS1xL1qcBa4/50007 BUT A BETTER WAY IS WHAT I CALL THE PROACTIONARY PRINCIPLE WHICH IS YOU ENGAGE WITH TECHNOLOGY
trainval/GS1xL1qcBa4/50008 YOU TRY IT OUT
trainval/GS1xL1qcBa4/50009 IS REALLY TO ALIGN OURSELVES WITH THIS FORCE MUCH GREATER THAN OURSELVES
trainval/gS3iLapiTCw/50001 YOU'VE GOT TO TRY IT ON YOUR OWN TO BELIEVE IT
trainval/gS3iLapiTCw/50002 CAN WE MAKE A LITTLE PRODUCT OR A SERVICE OUT OF IT
trainval/gS3iLapiTCw/50003 WE WENT AND SCAVENGED THE NEARBY MARKETS AND WE TRIED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT CAN WE PICK UP THAT WILL MAKE THIS HAPPEN
trainval/gS3iLapiTCw/50004 SO THAT'S IT AND WE HOPE TO DO THIS IN A BIG WAY
trainval/gSCSsL3it9Y/50001 I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO'S LEFT IN INDIA
trainval/gSCSsL3it9Y/50002 SO WE ARE FOUR OF US IN FOUR CORNERS OF THE WORLD
trainval/gSCSsL3it9Y/50003 AND SINCE I SAID THEY'RE MY ROLE MODELS I FOLLOWED TWO THINGS WHICH MY FATHER AND MOTHER GAVE ME
trainval/gSCSsL3it9Y/50004 FOR ME THE POLICING STOOD FOR POWER TO CORRECT POWER TO PREVENT AND POWER TO DETECT
trainval/gSCSsL3it9Y/50005 THAT'S THE REASON AS A WOMAN I JOINED THE INDIAN POLICE SERVICE
trainval/gSCSsL3it9Y/50006 I HAD OTHER OPTIONS BUT I DIDN'T CHOOSE THEM
trainval/gSCSsL3it9Y/50007 I SAID DO YOU PRAY
trainval/gSCSsL3it9Y/50008 I SAID ALL RIGHT LET'S PRAY
trainval/gSCSsL3it9Y/50009 I PRAYED FOR THEM AND THINGS STARTED TO CHANGE
trainval/gSHbRSAcN6Q/50001 I SMILE WORK HARD WHY SHOULD MY CONSCIENCE TWITCH OR FLINCH
trainval/GSIpG4t4Z5k/50001 SYRIA IS CURRENTLY IN THE MIDST OF A CONFLICT AND GENOCIDE THAT HAS TAKEN THE LIVES OF
trainval/GSIpG4t4Z5k/50002 TO BE SPEAKING ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT NEVER STRAYS FAR FROM MIND
trainval/GSIpG4t4Z5k/50003 JUST AS THE CIVILIAN OPPOSITION HAS BEEN DROWNED OUT BY THE TYRANNY OF THE ASSAD REGIME AND THE RADICAL
trainval/GSIpG4t4Z5k/50004 I WAS A SOPHOMORE IN HIGH SCHOOL 15 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME
trainval/GSIpG4t4Z5k/50005 LABELING REFUGEES AS POISON TO OUR SOCIETIES BOUND TO ONLY BRING OUR LIVES HARM
trainval/GSmaUPREKlU/50001 ONE OF THEM IS THE TWIN TREE PROGRAM AND THIS IS A POWERFUL PROGRAM
trainval/gSONUFFt2qM/50001 THE FIRST MEDIUM I FELT GAVE ME A VOICE WAS MUSIC
trainval/gSUvy6pvLA4/50001 AND THEN I MOVED GRADUALLY AROUND FEELING A LITTLE LOST SOMETIMES
trainval/gSUvy6pvLA4/50002 IT REMINDED ME IN AN ODD KIND OF WAY OF MY NIECE'S FIFTH BIRTHDAY PARTY
trainval/gSUvy6pvLA4/50003 WHERE ALL THE LITTLE GIRLS WOULD COME EITHER AS A PRINCESS OR A FAIRY
trainval/gSUvy6pvLA4/50004 THERE WAS ONE WHO WOULD COME AS A FAIRY PRINCESS
trainval/gSUvy6pvLA4/50005 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE LOOKS
trainval/gSUvy6pvLA4/50006 SO ALMOST ANYWHERE I WENT THERE THEY WERE
trainval/gSUvy6pvLA4/50008 AND THAT SEEMS FINE
trainval/gSUvy6pvLA4/50009 SO MAYBE IT'S TIME WE GOT THIS BACK A LITTLE
trainval/gSUvy6pvLA4/50010 I LOVE HIS ORANGE AND PINK BREECHES
trainval/gSUvy6pvLA4/50011 AND THAT WHAT THIS OBJECT WAS JUST AS MUCH IN A WAY IN ITS OWN WAY AS A LEONARDO DA VINCI PAINTING IS A
trainval/gtDS5rzd6R8/50001 I COULD GO ON THIS STAGE FOR AN HOUR TELLING YOU STORIES LIKE THAT BUT DON'T WORRY I ONLY HAVE TEN
trainval/gtDS5rzd6R8/50002 WHEN ERIC HAD FOUGHT HODGKIN'S AS A CHILD LEARNING THE SAXOPHONE GAVE HIM THE WILL TO GET UP AND GO
trainval/gto6w0a13B0/50001 I AM A MAKEUP ARTIST AND THESE ARE REAL WORDS FROM REAL WOMEN
trainval/gto6w0a13B0/50002 I'M ALSO AN ACTRESS BUT FOR MY PAST 7 YEARS OF DOING MAKEUP I HAVE DISCOVERED WITHIN THE
trainval/gto6w0a13B0/50003 BUT I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU
trainval/gto6w0a13B0/50004 AND YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/gto6w0a13B0/50005 MY MOTHER IN LAW SAYS THAT I HAVE A ROUND FACE AND THERE IS NO WAY TO MAKE A ROUND FAT
trainval/gto6w0a13B0/50006 THEY DO IT AND IT WORKS FOR THEM EVEN IF IT'S TEMPORARY
trainval/gto6w0a13B0/50007 WHAT WOULD EVA SAY TO ME IF I APOLOGIZED TO EVA
trainval/gto6w0a13B0/50008 BUT IT'S ACTUALLY VERY SCARY
trainval/GtXyGFMBWBs/50001 I HAD TO APOLOGIZE TO THE PEOPLE I HAD HURT
trainval/gUWWt30oZ3w/50001 SO FOR WORDS THAT MEANT THE SAME THING BUT ONLY HAD TWO SYLLABLES COMPARED TO A WORD THAT HAD THREE SYLLABLES I WOULD SAY THE WORD
trainval/gUWWt30oZ3w/50002 WHO TALKED THE MOST
trainval/gUWWt30oZ3w/50003 WITHOUT SKIPPING A BEAT EVERYONE THERE WOULD SAY MY NAME
trainval/gUWWt30oZ3w/50004 BECAUSE THEY HAD THE ANSWER TO WHAT I LACKED
trainval/gUWWt30oZ3w/50005 THE WORDS I COULD SAY BUT MEANT THE SAME THING
trainval/gUWWt30oZ3w/50006 SO THAT EXACT SAME THING YOU SAID THAT'S HOW I FEEL WHEN I WAS SPEAKING ENGLISH
trainval/gUWWt30oZ3w/50007 SALLY HUSTLES SEASHELLS ON THE BEACH
trainval/gUWWt30oZ3w/50008 THE PROBLEM AT HAND
trainval/gUWWt30oZ3w/50009 AND I THOUGHT SUBCONSCIOUSLY
trainval/gUWWt30oZ3w/50010 IF I RUN THE MOST MILES I WILL GET THE PRIZE AND I WILL EARN THE RESPECT OF THESE KIDS THAT TEASE ME
trainval/gUWWt30oZ3w/50011 WELL I RAN THE MOST MILES I GOT THE PRIZE I GOT SOME RESPECT BUT THAT DIDN'T CHANGE MY SPEAKING
trainval/gUWWt30oZ3w/50012 ASLAN IF YOU WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL YOU HAVE TO GET OUT OF THE COMFORT ZONE
trainval/guXxy8LH2QM/50001 THE HIRING SYSTEMS WE BUILT IN THE 20TH CENTURY ARE FAILING US AND CAUSING US TO MISS OUT ON PEOPLE WITH INCREDIBLE
trainval/guXxy8LH2QM/50002 BASEBALL WAS TRANSFORMED WHEN THE CASH STRAPPED OAKLAND ATHLETICS STARTED RECRUITING PLAYERS WHO DIDN'T SCORE HIGHLY ON
trainval/guXxy8LH2QM/50003 OUR CLIENTS ARE BENEFITING FROM 85 YEARS OF EMPLOYMENT RESEARCH WHICH SHOWS THAT WORK SAMPLES ARE ONE OF THE BEST
trainval/guXxy8LH2QM/50004 AND IF YOU'RE A CANDIDATE DON'T WAIT FOR AN EMPLOYER TO ASK
trainval/guXxy8LH2QM/50005 WE NEED EMPLOYERS TO LET GO OF OUTDATED HIRING PRACTICES AND EMBRACE NEW WAYS OF IDENTIFYING AND
trainval/Gv7Y0W0xmYQ/50001 I'LL PUT DOWN THE LAWSUIT AND THEY WILL SEND ME ALL THE INFORMATION I ASK FOR
trainval/Gv7Y0W0xmYQ/50002 I WANT TO MAKE THEM PUBLIC
trainval/gVLu99Ja2mA/50001 APOLLONIAN MINDSET CREATES MOUNTAINS OF WASTE
trainval/gVLu99Ja2mA/50002 BY THE MIDDLE OF THE 19TH CENTURY IT'S IN FULL FLOWER
trainval/gVLu99Ja2mA/50003 THAT HAPPENS IN THE BUILDING INDUSTRY AS WELL
trainval/gVLu99Ja2mA/50005 I GOT A JOB FOR YOU AS A FOREMAN ON A FRAMING CREW
trainval/gVLu99Ja2mA/50006 YOU WRITE THE CHECK AND INSTANTLY IT DEPRECIATES 30 PERCENT
trainval/gVLu99Ja2mA/50008 MAYBE TWO YEARS IF YOU READ EIGHT HOURS A DAY
trainval/gVLu99Ja2mA/50009 WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT
trainval/gVLu99Ja2mA/50010 WHAT DON'T YOU DO THIS
trainval/Gvo6xxoSSzE/50001 SO WE NEED TO GET THAT STUFF OUT OF THE RIVERS AND ALSO MAKE OUR RIVERBANKS BETTER
trainval/Gvo6xxoSSzE/50002 THIS IS WALNUT CREEK WHICH RUNS RIGHT IN FRONT OF WALMART IN WINDSOR HEIGHTS IF YOU FOLKS ARE FAMILIAR WITH IT
trainval/Gvo6xxoSSzE/50003 THIS IS A PICTURE WE TOOK THIS WEEK AS WELL
trainval/gVSyVSIybBM/50001 AND WE ADJUST
trainval/gVSyVSIybBM/50002 AND HIS ANSWER SURPRISED ME
trainval/gVSyVSIybBM/50003 WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT
trainval/gVSyVSIybBM/50004 DO I UNDERSTAND IT
trainval/GW02Vo641dU/50001 THIS TELLS THEM THE DIRECTION THE BALL'S GOING TO GO
trainval/GW02Vo641dU/50002 THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE SAME
trainval/GW02Vo641dU/50003 BUT WE DON'T WANT TO STOP THERE
trainval/gw2Mn3Bh1t8/50001 SOME OTHER FRIENDS TOOK US IN
trainval/gWD6g9CVSsc/50001 I'M NOT HAPPY
trainval/gWD6g9CVSsc/50002 SO I'M DOING IT FOR THEM AND THEY ARE DOING IT FOR ME
trainval/gWD6g9CVSsc/50003 WE ARE MEMBERS OF AN INVISIBLE TRIBE
trainval/gwMjgSqFm0M/50001 AND I AM HAPPY WITH THE POSITIVE CHANGE I SEE
trainval/gwMjgSqFm0M/50002 FIND OUT WHAT YOU CAN DO MORE WITHIN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD
trainval/gWmRkYsLzB4/50001 WE BRING TOGETHER HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF EXPERTS TO SOLVE IMPORTANT PROBLEMS FOR INDUSTRY AND ACADEMIA
trainval/gWmRkYsLzB4/50005 IT HAS TO STAND OUT FROM THE CROWD
trainval/gWmRkYsLzB4/50006 BUSINESS STRATEGY MEANS FINDING GAPS IN THE MARKET THINGS THAT NOBODY ELSE IS DOING
trainval/gWPFJgLAzu4/50001 BUT WHEN WE LOOK AROUND US WE SEE WE LIVE IN A UNIVERSE FULL OF INTERESTING STUFF FULL OF STARS PLANETS TREES
trainval/gWPFJgLAzu4/50002 THIS CONTRADICTION IS THE MOST PRESSING PROBLEM IN FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS AND IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WE MAY FIND OUT WHETHER
trainval/gWPFJgLAzu4/50003 IT SHOULD EITHER BE OFF SO THAT IT HAS A ZERO VALUE EVERYWHERE IN SPACE OR IT SHOULD BE ON SO IT HAS AN
trainval/gWPFJgLAzu4/50004 TWO NEW IDEAS WERE TURNING THE SUBJECT ON ITS HEAD
trainval/gWPFJgLAzu4/50005 BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY AN EVEN WORSE EXAMPLE OF THIS KIND OF FINE TUNING OF A DANGEROUS NUMBER AND THIS TIME IT COMES FROM THE OTHER
trainval/gWPFJgLAzu4/50006 ONE WAS EINSTEIN'S THEORY OF RELATIVITY THE OTHER WAS ARGUABLY EVEN MORE REVOLUTIONARY QUANTUM
trainval/gWPFJgLAzu4/50007 IF DARK ENERGY WERE ANYWHERE NEAR THIS STRONG THEN THE UNIVERSE WOULD HAVE BEEN TORN APART STARS AND GALAXIES COULD
trainval/gWPFJgLAzu4/50008 BUT UNLIKE THE HIGGS FIELD THIS NUMBER HAS NO KNOWN EXPLANATION
trainval/gWPFJgLAzu4/50009 THE HOPE WAS THAT A COMPLETE COMBINATION OF EINSTEIN'S GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY WHICH IS THE THEORY OF THE
trainval/gWPFJgLAzu4/50010 A HUNDRED YEARS ON WE NOW FIND OURSELVES AT ANOTHER TURNING POINT IN PHYSICS BUT WHAT'S AT STAKE NOW IS
trainval/gWPFJgLAzu4/50011 THE NEXT FEW YEARS MAY TELL US WHETHER WE'LL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF NATURE OR WHETHER
trainval/gWPFJgLAzu4/50012 WE CAN'T ACCESS THESE OTHER UNIVERSES SO THERE'S NO WAY OF KNOWING WHETHER THEY'RE THERE OR NOT
trainval/gWPFJgLAzu4/50013 BUT DESPITE HIGH HOPES THE LHC REVEALED A BARREN SUBATOMIC WILDERNESS POPULATED ONLY BY A LONELY
trainval/gWPFJgLAzu4/50014 THE STAKES NOW COULD NOT BE HIGHER
trainval/gWPFJgLAzu4/50015 THIS SUMMER THE LHC BEGAN ITS SECOND PHASE OF OPERATION WITH AN ENERGY ALMOST DOUBLE WHAT WE ACHIEVED IN THE FIRST RUN
trainval/gWPFJgLAzu4/50016 IF SO THEN WE CAN CONTINUE THIS LONG JOURNEY THAT BEGAN 100 YEARS AGO WITH ALBERT EINSTEIN TOWARDS AN EVER
trainval/gWPFJgLAzu4/50017 IT'S BEEN ESTIMATED IN FACT THAT THERE ARE 10 TO THE 500 DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF STRING THEORY
trainval/gWPFJgLAzu4/50018 SO IT'S ONLY A GOOD THING
trainval/gWPFJgLAzu4/50019 WHAT THEY'RE REALLY PLANNING TO DO IS TO BUILD A MACHINE THAT WILL STUDY THE HIGGS BOSON IN DETAIL AND COULD GIVE US SOME CLUES AS TO WHETHER THESE
trainval/gwPoM7lGYHw/50001 NOW 50 YEARS AGO THAT WAS A LAUGHABLY SIMPLE QUESTION
trainval/gwPoM7lGYHw/50002 EVERYBODY KNEW THE ANSWER
trainval/gwPoM7lGYHw/50003 IT WAS WRONG
trainval/gwPoM7lGYHw/50004 IT'S WHAT WE OUGHT TO BE DOING
trainval/gwPoM7lGYHw/50005 AND HE CALLED IT HYPOTHESIS FREE SCIENCE
trainval/gwPoM7lGYHw/50006 I MEAN LOOK AT THE ELEPHANT
trainval/gwPoM7lGYHw/50007 THAT CRAZY WOMAN
trainval/gwPoM7lGYHw/50008 WHY SHOULD IT BE THERE
trainval/gwPoM7lGYHw/50009 THEY CAN ALL BE WRONG
trainval/gwPoM7lGYHw/50010 SOME OF THEM HAVE COME OVER
trainval/gwPoM7lGYHw/50011 THERE WAS PROFESSOR TOBIAS
trainval/gwPoM7lGYHw/50012 HE'S COME OVER
trainval/gwPoM7lGYHw/50013 SIR DAVID ATTENBOROUGH HE'S COME OVER
trainval/gwPoM7lGYHw/50014 YEAH WELL WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT
trainval/gwPoM7lGYHw/50015 I'LL GO AHEAD WITH THAT
trainval/GwRzjFQaSOg/50001 CAN'T MAKE IT
trainval/gXlIASSrI4E/50001 BUT BOYS ARE NOT IMMUNE TO THIS EITHER
trainval/gXlIASSrI4E/50002 THEY HAVE LOWER SELF ESTEEM
trainval/gXlIASSrI4E/50003 THEY'RE MORE EASILY INFLUENCED BY PEOPLE AROUND THEM AND THEY'RE AT GREATER RISK OF DEPRESSION
trainval/gXvblfSgwg4/50001 I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER ALL OF THAT
trainval/gXvblfSgwg4/50002 BUT IF YOU BREAK IT UP YOU HAVE A LITTLE PIECE
trainval/gXvblfSgwg4/50003 IT'S THE SAME THING
trainval/gXvblfSgwg4/50004 NOW WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT
trainval/gXvblfSgwg4/50005 THEY ARE ALL THE SAME PARTICLES BUT WHY DO THEY EMIT DIFFERENT LIGHT
trainval/gXvblfSgwg4/50006 BECAUSE THE CORES ARE DIFFERENT SIZES
trainval/gXvblfSgwg4/50007 I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY FACEBOOKS EVERYBODY DOES
trainval/gXvblfSgwg4/50008 NOW THESE CLUSTERS ARE IMPORTANT
trainval/gXvblfSgwg4/50009 WITH THAT IN MIND ALL OF YOU CAN THINK ABOUT THAT
trainval/gXvblfSgwg4/50010 IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT
trainval/GXySSkBVq1M/50001 I NERVOUSLY PEERED OVER THE SIDE OF THE BED TO SEE WHAT HAD BEFALLEN MY FALLEN SISTER AND SAW THAT SHE HAD LANDED PAINFULLY ON HER
trainval/GXySSkBVq1M/50002 AND IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN YOU'VE SEEN THIS HUNDREDS OF TIMES
trainval/GXySSkBVq1M/50003 DID YOU SEE HOW YOU LANDED
trainval/GXySSkBVq1M/50004 NO HUMAN LANDS ON ALL FOURS LIKE THAT
trainval/GXySSkBVq1M/50005 SO WE WERE UP ON TOP OF OUR BUNK BEDS
trainval/GXySSkBVq1M/50006 THE FIRST THING I WANT TO DO IS START WITH A GRAPH
trainval/GXySSkBVq1M/50007 AND ON ONE SIDE OF THE BUNK BED I HAD PUT OUT ALL OF MY G
trainval/GXySSkBVq1M/50008 AND WE TAILOR THE CLASS TOWARDS THE AVERAGE
trainval/GXySSkBVq1M/50009 BUT NORMAL IS MERELY AVERAGE
trainval/GXySSkBVq1M/50010 JOE SOLDIERS AND WEAPONRY
trainval/GXySSkBVq1M/50012 AND IF WE CAN CHANGE THE LENS NOT ONLY CAN WE CHANGE YOUR HAPPINESS WE CAN CHANGE EVERY SINGLE EDUCATIONAL AND BUSINESS OUTCOME AT THE SAME TIME
trainval/GXySSkBVq1M/50013 THERE ARE DIFFERING ACCOUNTS OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED THAT AFTERNOON BUT SINCE MY SISTER IS NOT HERE WITH US TODAY LET
trainval/GXySSkBVq1M/50014 AND IN MY RESEARCH AND MY TEACHING I FOUND THAT THESE STUDENTS NO MATTER HOW HAPPY THEY WERE WITH THEIR ORIGINAL SUCCESS OF GETTING INTO THE
trainval/GXySSkBVq1M/50015 AND FRIDAY NIGHT WE'RE TRYING TO DECIDE BETWEEN RISKY SEX OR HAPPINESS
trainval/GXySSkBVq1M/50016 SILENCE ON THE PHONE
trainval/GXySSkBVq1M/50017 AND INTO THE SILENCE I SAID I'D BE HAPPY TO SPEAK AT YOUR SCHOOL BUT THAT'S NOT A WELLNESS WEEK THAT'S A SICKNESS WEEK
trainval/GXySSkBVq1M/50018 YOU'VE OUTLINED ALL THE NEGATIVE THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN BUT NOT TALKED ABOUT THE POSITIVE
trainval/GXySSkBVq1M/50019 WE NEED TO REVERSE THE FORMULA FOR HAPPINESS AND SUCCESS
trainval/GXySSkBVq1M/50020 IN THE LAST THREE YEARS I'VE TRAVELED TO 45 COUNTRIES WORKING WITH SCHOOLS AND COMPANIES IN THE MIDST OF AN ECONOMIC
trainval/GXySSkBVq1M/50021 YOU GOT GOOD GRADES NOW YOU HAVE TO GET BETTER GRADES YOU GOT INTO A GOOD SCHOOL AND AFTER YOU GET INTO A BETTER ONE YOU GOT A GOOD JOB NOW YOU HAVE
trainval/GXySSkBVq1M/50022 IN FACT WE'VE FOUND THAT EVERY SINGLE BUSINESS OUTCOME IMPROVES
trainval/GXySSkBVq1M/50023 YOUR BRAIN AT POSITIVE IS 31 MORE PRODUCTIVE THAN YOUR BRAIN AT NEGATIVE NEUTRAL OR STRESSED
trainval/GXySSkBVq1M/50024 IN JUST A TWO MINUTE SPAN OF TIME DONE FOR 21 DAYS IN A ROW WE CAN ACTUALLY REWIRE YOUR BRAIN ALLOWING YOUR
trainval/GXySSkBVq1M/50025 JOURNALING ABOUT ONE POSITIVE EXPERIENCE YOU'VE HAD OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS ALLOWS YOUR BRAIN TO RELIVE IT
trainval/GXySSkBVq1M/50026 EXERCISE TEACHES YOUR BRAIN THAT YOUR BEHAVIOR MATTERS
trainval/gYKyaDOyUO4/50001 I REALLY BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE HAS SOMETHING TO LEARN FROM THE B BOY PROCESS THIS BREAKIN' MENTALITY
trainval/gyM6rx69iqg/50001 FRAMING AND RE FRAMING PROBLEMS CONNECTING AND COMBINING IDEAS AND CHALLENGING ASSUMPTIONS
trainval/gyM6rx69iqg/50002 BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS NOT ENOUGH
trainval/gyM6rx69iqg/50003 THE QUESTION WHAT IF THE EARTH IS NOT THE CENTER OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM
trainval/gyM6rx69iqg/50004 WHAT IF THE SUN IS
trainval/gyM6rx69iqg/50005 BECAUSE MOST JOKES WE TELL ARE INTERESTING BECAUSE THE FRAME SWITCHES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE JOKE
trainval/gyM6rx69iqg/50006 SO THAT S ONE OF THE WAYS YOU CAN INCREASE YOUR IMAGINATION
trainval/gyM6rx69iqg/50007 BUT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS
trainval/gyM6rx69iqg/50008 AFTER I FINISHED MY PHD I WENT OUT TO STUDY AND SORT OF LEARN ALL ABOUT CREATIVITY IN THE WILD WORKING IN
trainval/gyM6rx69iqg/50009 SO WE ARE GETTING REALLY INCREMENTAL SOLUTIONS
trainval/gyM6rx69iqg/50010 WE HAVE TO PAY PEOPLE TO TAKE IT AWAY
trainval/gyM6rx69iqg/50011 TO RAISE THE BAR EVEN FURTHER I GAVE THEM A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A CHALLENGE
trainval/gyM6rx69iqg/50012 I TOLD THEM THAT I HAD SENT A NOTE OUOT WHICH I DID TO MY COLLEAGUES AROUND THE WORLD
trainval/gyM6rx69iqg/50013 AND INVITED THEIR STUDENTS TO PARTICIPATE AT THE SAME TIME
trainval/gyM6rx69iqg/50014 BUT I M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO DOES IT
trainval/gyM6rx69iqg/50015 I WANNA TELL YOU A QUICK STORY ABOUT A FRIEND OF MINE BOB SIEGEL WHO IS A PROFESSOR OF HERE STANFORD WHO TAUGHT A
trainval/gyM6rx69iqg/50016 BUT IMAGINATION AND KNOWLEDGE ARE NOT ENOUGH
trainval/gyM6rx69iqg/50017 YOU ARE NOT GOING TO RE FRAME PROBLEMS
trainval/gyM6rx69iqg/50018 IT S THE RULES
trainval/gyM6rx69iqg/50020 IT S THE CONSTRAINTS
trainval/gyM6rx69iqg/50021 I SPENT MY ENTIRE GROWING UP WRITING SILENCE IS GOLDEN
trainval/gyM6rx69iqg/50022 AND THE FACT IS WE THEN GET VERY UPSET BECAUSE THE STUDENTS YOU KNOW THEY ARE JUST NOT SO CREATIVE ANYMORE AND EVERYONE
trainval/gyM6rx69iqg/50023 REALLY INNOVATIVE FIRMS KNOW THIS WELL
trainval/gyM6rx69iqg/50024 BUT THIS IS NOT ENOUGH
trainval/gyM6rx69iqg/50025 IF YOU CAN IMAGINE IT YOU CAN BUILD IT
trainval/gyM6rx69iqg/50026 AND MORE TYPE OF RESOURCES WE HAVE THAT DETERMINE WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT
trainval/gyM6rx69iqg/50027 IT S UP TO THEM TO TURN IT
trainval/gypAjPp6eps/50001 SO WE HAD TO FIND A WAY TO RULE OUT ALIENS
trainval/gyPoqFcvt9w/50001 DESPITE LIMPING FOR DAYS AND CRYING FOR WEEKS THIS INCIDENT DIDN'T FIT MY IDEAS ABOUT RAPE
trainval/gyPoqFcvt9w/50002 ONE DAY I STORMED OUT OF THE DOOR IN TEARS AFTER A FIGHT WITH A LOVED ONE AND I WANDERED INTO A CAF
trainval/gyPoqFcvt9w/50003 BECAUSE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT HE DESERVED MY FORGIVENESS I DESERVED
trainval/gyPoqFcvt9w/50004 AND THIS WAS ABOUT ANALYZING OUR OWN HISTORY
trainval/gyPoqFcvt9w/50005 AT TIMES OUR SEARCH FOR UNDERSTANDING IN CAPE TOWN FELT LIKE AN IMPOSSIBLE QUEST AND ALL I
trainval/gyPoqFcvt9w/50006 ONCE SOMEONE'S BEEN DEEMED A VICTIM IT'S THAT MUCH EASIER TO FILE THEM AWAY AS SOMEONE
trainval/gyPoqFcvt9w/50007 HOW CAN WE DISCUSS SOLUTIONS TO ONE OF THE BIGGEST THREATS TO THE LIVES OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN AROUND THE
trainval/gyPoqFcvt9w/50008 AND THIS MARKED THE START OF AN EIGHT YEAR LONG CORRESPONDENCE THAT GOD KNOWS WAS
trainval/gyPoqFcvt9w/50009 I RELIEVED MYSELF OF THE BURDENS THAT I'D WRONGFULLY SHOULDERED AND HE IN TURN WHOLEHEARTEDLY OWNED UP TO
trainval/gyPoqFcvt9w/50010 OUR WRITTEN EXCHANGES BECAME A PLATFORM TO DISSECT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT NIGHT AND THEY WERE EVERYTHING
trainval/gyPoqFcvt9w/50011 BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY
trainval/gyPoqFcvt9w/50012 AND AS A RESULT I'VE BEEN READING WRITING AND SPEAKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE FOR OVER A DECADE NOW GOING TO
trainval/GYzLcpN8dso/50001 I BOUGHT THE CURRICULUM AND I LEARNED IT
trainval/GYzLcpN8dso/50002 BUT NONE OF US WERE EXPERTS IN GLOBAL HEALTH AND WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT SORT OF A MEDICATION WE COULD FUND RAISE FOR
trainval/GYzLcpN8dso/50003 IF CHILDREN ARE TAUGHT TO CULTIVATE THE CREATIVITY THEY ARE BORN WITH IT WILL RESULT IN A GENERATION OF INNOVATORS
trainval/GzB0BDstCI0/50001 JUST NAME YOUR PARENTAL ANXIETIES
trainval/GzB0BDstCI0/50002 I MEAN YOU TALK ABOUT LOW PRIORITY RIGHT
trainval/GzB0BDstCI0/50003 OR FANCY APPLIANCES
trainval/gZCgWmose3c/50001 BUT THIS WAS COMMON
trainval/gZCgWmose3c/50002 WE WANT YOU TO STOP DOING THAT
trainval/gZCgWmose3c/50003 AND WE DO THAT WITH ELECTRICITY
trainval/gZCgWmose3c/50004 WE IMPLANTED ELECTRODES IN THE FORNIX OF PATIENTS WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE WE TURNED IT ON AND WE LOOKED AT WHAT HAPPENS TO
trainval/gzcwS02ZB1o/50002 IT'S A PROGRAM THAT RICHARD THALER FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO AND I DEVISED MAYBE
trainval/gzcwS02ZB1o/50003 WE KNOW WE SHOULD BE SAVING
trainval/gzcwS02ZB1o/50004 CHRISTMAS IS COMING WE MIGHT AS WELL BUY A LOT OF GIFTS FOR EVERYONE WE KNOW
trainval/gzcwS02ZB1o/50005 ONE PERCENT CHECK THE BOX
trainval/gzcwS02ZB1o/50006 WHY HAVE YOU TAKEN OUR APPLE
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50001 NOW WE DON'T HAVE DISCIPLINE WE HAVE OCD
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50002 ANYTIME YOU CHALLENGE YOURSELF TO SOMETHING ANYTHING NO MATTER HOW BIG OR HOW SMALL AND YOU ACHIEVE THAT THING YOUR
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50004 I'M NOT GOING TO POSITION THIS THAT WAY AT ALL
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50005 AND BASICALLY THE WAY THIS GAME IS PLAYED
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50006 OKAY YOU LOVE THIS
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50007 THEY'RE PROVIDING A LOT OF FEEDBACK ON THE LIVE EXPERIENCE
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50008 IT JUST DEPENDS
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50009 NOT YOU OKAY NOT YOU BUT YOU
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50010 AND ALL THAT IS REALLY CUTE RIGHT
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50011 WHAT ARE THE REAL BUSINESS EFFECTS OF THIS
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50013 TEENAGERS DON'T DRIVE THE WAY THEY USED TO
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50014 THEY DON'T WANT TO ANYMORE
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50015 I SAID WHAT'S IT ABOUT
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50016 THEY SAID THE RESEARCH CLASSIC MILLENNIAL STUFF
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50017 THEIR CARE'S THE ENVIRONMENT
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50018 THEY DON'T WANT TO DRIVE A CAR OR SPEND MONEY ON A CAR BUT THE NUMBER ONE REASON WHY DRIVING RATES HAVE FALLEN OFF A
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50019 HOW DOES THE LIVE PERFORMANCE INDUSTRY RESPOND TO SOCIAL MEDIA
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50020 AND HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL VERY EFFECTIVE INSTEAD OF FIGHTING WITH IT ROLL WITH IT AND LEVERAGE THAT
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50021 THEY WANT TO COME AND DECIDE THE OUTCOME
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50022 WE'VE GOT VOTING IN REALITY TELEVISION
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50023 BUT IN PRACTICE THEY WANT YOU TO GIVE THEM THE ENTERTAINMENT
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50024 THEY WANT TO BE PART OF THAT THOUGH THEY'D LIKE TO BE MORE VISCERALLY INVOLVED
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50025 THIS GAME REPLACES THE SOARING INSPIRATIONAL VIDEO ON HOW DOMINO'S USES ONLY THE FRESHEST
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50026 SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THIS AMAZING GOOGLE GLASS GAME CALLED ZOMBIES RUN
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50027 HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE THINGS THAT I DO IS VERY IMPORTANT AND I WANT TO KNOW I'M MAKING PROGRESS AND I WANT
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50028 AND THIS IS CORE TO GAMIFICATION
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50029 YOU KNOW THAT IN THE UNITED STATES FOUR FIFTHS OF THE POPULATION WATCHED BROADCAST ENTERTAINMENT LIKE A TV SHOW
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50030 I DON'T ONLY WANT TO CONSUME THE NUGGETS YOU'VE GIVEN ME IF I'M REALLY INTO THE THING YOU'RE MAKING I WANT TO CONSUME AS MUCH OF IT AS
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50031 JUST LIKE YOU MAY BE A PART OF A TRIBE IF YOU REALLY LIKE SONDHEIM MUSICALS
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50032 BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT IF YOU'RE 45 YOU STILL WANT CHALLENGING YOU STILL WANT THE CONTENT YOU WANT YOU STILL WANT TO FEEL CONNECTED TO THE
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50033 HOW ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO SIT THROUGH TWO HOURS OF NOT INTERACTING
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50034 IF YOU TEXT MY MOM RIGHT NOW AND YOU'RE LIKE
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50035 HEY GABE'S MOM WHAT ARE YOU DOING
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50037 WE'RE AT A MOMENT IN TIME IN LIVE PERFORMANCE IN THE CREATION OF CONTENT
trainval/gZga0AmCGdE/50038 AND GAMIFICATION IS THE PLATFORM WE'LL USE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN
trainval/GZGY0wPAnus/50003 PUT YOUR HAND UP A LITTLE BIT HIGHER BUT WATCH IT CLOSE
trainval/GZGY0wPAnus/50004 IF I DID IT SLOWLY IT'D BE ON YOUR SHOULDER
trainval/GZGY0wPAnus/50005 BRING THEM OUT CHECK AND SEE HOW ACCURATE YOU WERE
trainval/GZGY0wPAnus/50007 WE'RE JUST SHOPPING
trainval/GZGY0wPAnus/50008 THIS TRICK'S MORE ABOUT THE TIMING
trainval/GZGY0wPAnus/50009 I'M GOING TO TRY TO PUSH IT INSIDE YOUR HAND
trainval/GZGY0wPAnus/50010 BUT IT'S ONLY A START
trainval/GZGY0wPAnus/50011 DON'T RUN AWAY
trainval/GZGY0wPAnus/50012 EVEN MORE THAN THAT WHAT ABOUT PREDICTING HUMAN BEHAVIOR
trainval/GZGY0wPAnus/50013 HOPEFULLY IT MATCHES HIS TASTE
trainval/GZGY0wPAnus/50014 MAKE YOUR BEST GUESS
trainval/GZGY0wPAnus/50015 WHAT COLOR IS MY SHIRT
trainval/GZGY0wPAnus/50016 FOR ME I LIKE TO THINK OF IT VERY SIMPLE LIKE A SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM
trainval/GZGY0wPAnus/50017 IF YOU DON'T ATTEND TO SOMETHING YOU CAN'T BE AWARE OF IT
trainval/GZGY0wPAnus/50018 WHAT JUST HAPPENED
trainval/GZGY0wPAnus/50019 DO YOU HAVE A WALLET
trainval/GZGY0wPAnus/50020 IF I COME DOWN I'M GOING TO DO A BIT OF SHOPPING
trainval/gZlzCc57qX4/50001 IF PERSON B TURNS OUT TO BE TRUSTWORTHY YOU'VE MADE TEN EUROS OUT OF YOUR FIVE
trainval/gZlzCc57qX4/50002 AND THE RESULTS ALWAYS LOOKED VERY SIMILAR
trainval/gZlzCc57qX4/50004 TRUSTFUL PEOPLE ARE PERCEIVED TO BE WARM AND COMPETENT AND DISTRUSTFUL PEOPLE ARE PERCEIVED TO
trainval/gZlzCc57qX4/50005 SO FOR INSTANCE WHEN BEING PERSON B IN SUCH A TRUST GAME WE THINK
trainval/gZlzCc57qX4/50006 BUT WHAT WE FORGET THEN IS THAT MOST OTHER PERSONS B WOULD EXPERIENCE EXACTLY THE SAME FEELINGS AND FOR THAT REASON THEY WOULD
trainval/gZpcTVqpaPw/50001 EVERY EATING DISORDER IS DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY THEY START AND HOW THEY PRESENT THEMSELVES TO THE RULES THAT GOVERN THEM
trainval/gZpcTVqpaPw/50003 FIVE HOUR LABS WERE UNBEARABLE
trainval/gZpcTVqpaPw/50004 I WAS GOING IN AND DEALING WITH DANGEROUS CHEMICALS HAVING NOT EATEN FOR ALMOST 24 HOURS
trainval/gZpcTVqpaPw/50005 HOW I DIDN'T HARM MYSELF OR SOMEBODY ELSE I HAVE NO IDEA
trainval/gZpcTVqpaPw/50006 MY BLOOD SUGAR CRASHED
trainval/gZpcTVqpaPw/50007 SO I STAYED ILL
trainval/gZpcTVqpaPw/50008 YOU CAN WANT IT MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD
trainval/GzPpH9WexDc/50001 WE NEED SUNLIGHT AND GREEN GRASS AND FRESH AIR
trainval/GzPpH9WexDc/50002 WHY AREN'T WE ALL OVER THIS
trainval/GzPpH9WexDc/50003 GREEN BUILDINGS SHOULD BE THE MAINSTREAM BUT IF YOU GO OUTSIDE WALK AROUND DOWNTOWN OR THROUGH YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD YOU'LL SEE
trainval/gzthxdm7XNs/50001 BUT WE NOW STAND ON THE VERGE OF ANOTHER REVOLUTION IN GEOLOCATION ACCURACY
trainval/gzthxdm7XNs/50002 ON THAT MORNING U
trainval/gzthxdm7XNs/50003 I WAS IN MY OFFICE SOME MONTHS BACK AND GOT A TELEPHONE CALL
trainval/gzthxdm7XNs/50004 OKAY WHAT ABOUT THE FBI
trainval/gzthxdm7XNs/50005 THE SUPREME COURT RULED LAST MONTH THAT A POLICEMAN HAS TO GET A WARRANT IF HE WANTS TO DO PROLONGED
trainval/gzthxdm7XNs/50006 IT'S CALLED THE WAVE BUBBLE
trainval/gzthxdm7XNs/50007 AND WHY IS THAT
trainval/gzthxdm7XNs/50008 WE'RE ALMOST BLINDLY RELIANT ON IT
trainval/gzthxdm7XNs/50009 I SHOULD HAVE ONE
trainval/GZyjTPEufLk/50001 IN THE CASE OF THESE SOUTHERN SCANDINAVIANS LIVING NEAR THE COAST THEY WERE FISHING MARINE FISH
trainval/GzzHawjP648/50002 SO THAT'S WHY THE MEDIAN IS A REALLY GOOD INDICATOR OF CENTRAL TENDENCY
trainval/GzzHawjP648/50003 ONLY TALKING ABOUT PERCENTAGES IS VERY MISLEADING
trainval/GzzHawjP648/50004 AND THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A PERCENTAGE VALUE INCREASE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN
trainval/GzzHawjP648/50005 THE OTHER WAY THAT WE CAN THINK ABOUT AFFORDABILITY IS IN TERMS OF OUR INCOME
trainval/GzzHawjP648/50006 WE NEED TO BECOME AWARE ABOUT ECONOMICS AND WE NEED TO EMBRACE IT
trainval/GzzHawjP648/50007 ALL I DID FOR YOU TODAY WAS TALK ABOUT GROWTH IN TERMS OF REAL DOLLAR VALUES IN TERMS OF
trainval/H03o2WCBoDU/50001 RECENTLY WE'VE HEARD A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES TALK ABOUT RESTRICTING IMPORTS AND PROTECTING THEIR
trainval/H03o2WCBoDU/50002 WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THIS DURING THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
trainval/H03o2WCBoDU/50003 SOME HAVE BLAMED TRADE FOR SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WE'VE BEEN HAVING HERE AT HOME IN THE US
trainval/H03o2WCBoDU/50004 MIKE LOST HIS JOB TO A MACHINE
trainval/H03o2WCBoDU/50005 SO THAT MEANS THAT ONE OUT OF 10 LOST MANUFACTURING JOBS WAS DUE
trainval/H03o2WCBoDU/50006 IN FACT AUTOMATION IS SPREADING TO EVERY PRODUCTION LINE IN EVERY COUNTRY AROUND THE WORLD
trainval/H03o2WCBoDU/50007 WHEN I HEAR STORIES LIKE THIS I THINK THAT WHAT PEOPLE PICTURE IS THAT TRADE HAPPENS BETWEEN ONLY TWO
trainval/H03o2WCBoDU/50008 I'M A SUPPLY CHAIN PROFESSIONAL AND I LIVE AND WORK IN MEXICO
trainval/H03o2WCBoDU/50009 THINK ABOUT IT
trainval/H03o2WCBoDU/50010 NOW THIS APPROACH TO PROCESSING GOES ON ALL AROUND THE WORLD TO MANUFACTURE MANY OF THE PRODUCTS
trainval/H03o2WCBoDU/50011 THINK ABOUT HOW YOUR HOUSE WAS BUILT OR YOUR KITCHEN RENOVATED
trainval/H03o2WCBoDU/50012 SO LET'S APPLY THIS PROCESS TO THE CORPORATE WORLD
trainval/H03o2WCBoDU/50013 COMPANIES TODAY FOCUS ON MANUFACTURING WHAT THEY PRODUCE BEST AND MOST EFFICIENTLY
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50001 I REMEMBER THIS STRANGE MAN TAKING ME WAY UP INTO THE MOUNTAINS BEHIND MY HOME ALL THE WHILE AT KNIFE
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50002 I MEAN I REMEMBER BEING BROUGHT SO FAR UP INTO THE MOUNTAINS
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50003 WE CROSSED RIGHT OVER THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN AND STARTED DOWN THE OTHER SIDE
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50004 THERE WAS A TENT SET UP
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50005 SHE BROUGHT ME IN AND SHE SAT ME DOWN ON A BUCKET WHERE SHE TRIED TO SPONGE BATHE ME AND CHANGE ME OUT OF
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50006 FINALLY AFTER I DON'T KNOW 15 MINUTES PROBABLY OF BEGGING AND CRYING SHE
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50007 I REMEMBER SITTING THERE AND CRYING AND CRYING AND THINKING OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50008 HOW HAD JUST YESTERDAY I HAD BEEN AT SCHOOL WITH MY FRIENDS HOW HAD JUST YESTERDAY I'D BEEN AT
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50009 HOW HAD MY WORLD TURNED FROM DAY TO NIGHT AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO MY FAMILY
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50010 HAD THIS MAN GONE THROUGH MY HOUSE ALREADY AND MURDERED MY FAMILY
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50011 THERE ARE DAYS WHEN WE WISH WE COULD PULL THE COVERS BACK UP AND HIBERNATE
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50012 WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50013 THE ONLY THOUGHTS THAT I COULD THINK OF WERE GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME WERE
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50014 HE'S GOING TO RAPE ME AND THEN HE'S GOING TO KILL ME BECAUSE NOBODY SURVIVES BEING KIDNAPPED
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50015 FINALLY SOME PART OF ME PULLED MYSELF TOGETHER LONG ENOUGH TO HEAR HIM SAY THE WORDS THAT I
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50016 BUT WE ALL HAVE A CHOICE TO MAKE
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50017 AND SO HERE THIS MAN WAS TELLING ME THAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO CONSUMMATE OUR MARRIAGE AND I MAY HAVE GROWN UP
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50018 I REMEMBER BEGGING AND PLEADING AND CRYING AND TRIED TO COME UP WITH EVERY
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50019 I WILL NEVER FORGET
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50020 HE PULLED ME OFF THE BUCKET WHERE I'D BEEN SITTING ONTO THE GROUND WHERE HE RIPPED OFF THE ROBE I'D BEEN FORCED TO
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50021 THEY ARE THE LUCKY ONES
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50022 THEY ARE SO LUCKY
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50023 I WISH I COULD BE ONE OF THOSE CHILDREN BECAUSE NO ONE WILL EVER HURT THEM AGAIN
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50024 NO ONE CAN NEVER DO THAT TO THEM AGAIN
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50025 I KNOW THAT WHEN WE ARE FACED WITH TRIALS WE HAVE A CHOICE
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50026 WE CAN GIVE IN AND SURRENDER OR WE CAN FIGHT AND WE CAN MOVE FORWARD
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50027 I AM GRATEFUL THAT I CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50028 I WILL NEVER FORGET THE FIRST TIME I SAW MY DAD AFTER THE POLICE HAD STOPPED AND PICKED ME UP
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50029 IT IS SO IMPORTANT
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50030 SO I HAVE TO ENCOURAGE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50031 YOU'LL NEVER KNOW THE LIVES YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TOUCH
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50032 I WILL NEVER FORGET FEELING THAT NO MATTER WHAT LAY IN FRONT OF ME IT WAS GOING TO BE
trainval/h0C2LPXaEW4/50033 THE BEST PUNISHMENT YOU COULD EVER GIVE HIM IS TO BE HAPPY IS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH YOUR LIFE
trainval/h0dSQDgl3gI/50001 ON THE ONE SIDE IT'S TRADITIONAL POWER THINK OF ORGANIZED INSTITUTIONAL POWERS LIKE GOVERNMENTS AND LARGE MULTI
trainval/h0dSQDgl3gI/50002 AND IN MANY CASES THE INTERESTS ARE ALIGNING
trainval/h0dSQDgl3gI/50003 AND THE POLICE WHO ARE LIKE TRAINED ON AGATHA CHRISTIE NOVELS
trainval/h0dSQDgl3gI/50004 BUT WHEN BIG INSTITUTIONS FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT THEY HAD MORE RAW POWER TO MAGNIFY AND THEY GOT EVEN MORE
trainval/h0dSQDgl3gI/50005 THE INSTITUTIONAL ARE SLOWER BUT ABLE TO USE POWER MORE EFFECTIVELY
trainval/h0dSQDgl3gI/50006 SO ALL THE SYRIAN DISSIDENTS USED FACEBOOK TO ORGANIZE
trainval/h0dSQDgl3gI/50007 IS THE QUICK OR THE STRONG
trainval/h0dSQDgl3gI/50008 WHETHER IT'S SETTING UP YOUR OWN EMAIL SERVER OR USING ENCRYPTION OR BREAKING COPY PROTECTION THE TECHNOLOGIES ARE
trainval/h0dSQDgl3gI/50009 THE TERRORISTS OR THE MEDIA INDUSTRY VS
trainval/h0dSQDgl3gI/50010 THE PIRATES OR CHINA VS
trainval/h0dSQDgl3gI/50011 THERE'S ALSO A CRIME RATE THAT SOCIETY IS WILLING TO TOLERATE
trainval/h0dSQDgl3gI/50012 AND WE NEED TO PRESERVE IT
trainval/h0dSQDgl3gI/50013 BUT WE'VE KIND OF FORGOTTEN IT IN OUR FEAR OF TERRORISM OR OTHER MODERN THREATS
trainval/h0dSQDgl3gI/50014 OVERSIGHT IS THE SECOND THING
trainval/h0dSQDgl3gI/50015 IT'S ALSO CRITICAL
trainval/h0dSQDgl3gI/50016 AND AGAIN IT'S A LONG UNDERSTOOD MECHANISM FOR CHECKING POWER
trainval/h0dSQDgl3gI/50017 AND IT'S A COMBINATION OF THINGS
trainval/h0dSQDgl3gI/50018 IT'S COURTS THAT ACT AS THIRD PARTY ADVOCATES IT'S LEGISLATORS THAT UNDERSTAND TECHNOLOGIES IT'S A VIBRANT
trainval/h0dSQDgl3gI/50019 AND THE KEY TO ALL THIS IS ACCESS TO DATA
trainval/h0dSQDgl3gI/50020 TO THE EXTENT THE POWERLESS HAVE ACCESS TO IT THEY GAIN IN POWER TO EXTENT THE ALREADY POWER HAVE ACCESS TO IT
trainval/h0dSQDgl3gI/50021 BUT WE ALL HAVE A DUTY TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM
trainval/h0dSQDgl3gI/50022 IS THERE ACTUALLY NO ROOM FOR FREEDOM LIBERTY AND SOCIAL CHANGE IN THE TECHNOLOGICAL FUTURE
trainval/H1fvr9rGgSg/50001 THOSE CONVICTED OF MURDER WERE CONDEMNED TO DIE IN PRISON AND IT WAS DURING THOSE MEETINGS WITH THOSE MEN THAT I
trainval/H1fvr9rGgSg/50002 THE POTENTIAL JAIL TIME HE FACED IS WHAT STRESSED CHRISTOPHER OUT THE MOST
trainval/H1fvr9rGgSg/50003 I WAS STANDING IN ARRAIGNMENTS THAT DAY WHEN CHRISTOPHER'S CASE CAME ACROSS MY DESK
trainval/H1fvr9rGgSg/50004 I WOULD CHOOSE WHETHER TO LEVERAGE CHRISTOPHER INTO A PLEA DEAL OR TAKE THE CASE TO TRIAL AND ULTIMATELY I WOULD BE IN A POSITION TO ASK FOR
trainval/H1fvr9rGgSg/50005 WITHOUT THOSE PROTECTIVE FACTORS IN HIS LIFE CHRISTOPHER WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO COMMIT FURTHER MORE SERIOUS CRIME
trainval/H1fvr9rGgSg/50006 WHY ARE WE SPENDING 80 BILLION DOLLARS ON A PRISON INDUSTRY THAT WE KNOW IS FAILING WHEN WE COULD TAKE THAT
trainval/H1fvr9rGgSg/50007 THE NEXT TIME THERE'S A LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S ELECTION IN YOUR JURISDICTION ASK CANDIDATES THESE QUESTIONS
trainval/H1fvr9rGgSg/50008 I CAME OUT AS A PROSECUTOR EXPECTED TO DO JUSTICE BUT I NEVER LEARNED WHAT JUSTICE WAS IN MY CLASSES NONE OF US DO
trainval/h1Yg1rURKR0/50001 WE PUT A CERTAIN VISION OF WHAT GOOD OR BAD OR NORMAL OR USUAL IS IN FRONT OF PEOPLE BY
trainval/h27g5iT0tck/50001 IN THIS CASE THAT'S NOT ENOUGH
trainval/h27g5iT0tck/50002 WHICH IT WAS NEVER DESIGNED OR QUALIFIED FOR
trainval/h27g5iT0tck/50003 TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA THE AVERAGE MARS MISSION TAKES HUNDREDS OF SCIENTISTS FOR YEARS TO
trainval/h27g5iT0tck/50004 THAT'S 100 MILLION KILOS A DAY
trainval/h2KQoHMCwlw/50001 THERE ARE MANY EXCELLENT REASONS TO GO TO MARS BUT FOR ANYONE TO TELL YOU THAT MARS WILL BE THERE TO BACK UP HUMANITY
trainval/h2KQoHMCwlw/50002 NO THEY'RE IN FACT TWO SIDES OF THE SAME GOAL TO UNDERSTAND PRESERVE AND IMPROVE LIFE INTO THE
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50001 OKAY WHY DON T YOU GUYS GO OUT GET A VILLAGE VOICE AND FIND HIM AN APARTMENT WE LL HAVE A PAINTING PARTY I LL BRING A
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50003 AND THEY BRIGHTENED UP
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50004 I SAID A WOMAN
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50005 HE SAID YEAH I HAVE A PLACE TO ENTERTAIN NOW
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50006 HE HAD ONE POSITIVE ATTRIBUTE
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50007 I REALLY AM BECAUSE IT S ALL ABOUT DREAMS AND THAT S WHAT IT S ALL ABOUT AND NO KIDDING THAT S
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50008 AND SO I JUST GAVE UP

trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50010 WELL THAT S WHAT I CALL HIM
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50012 WE HAD TO WALK HIM HOME NBSP AFTER THE GROUP BUT WE WERE USED TO HIM WE LIKED HIM

trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50014 I D GOTTEN A DIVORCE I NBSP HAD NO MONEY I WAS IN NEW YORK CITY I HAD TWO VERY SMALL CHILDREN
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50016 I COULDN T GET A DAY CARE CENTER SO I COULDN T TAKE A JOB
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50018 JUST OUT OF POLITENESS AND HE WOULD ALWAYS SAY I M FINE
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50019 SHE SAID YES
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50020 WE VE GOT TRAINERS TOO
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50021 WE VE GOT EVERYTHING
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50023 WE GOT INNOCENT VISITING COUSINS FROM OHIO AND WE HAD THE PARTY
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50024 IT WAS A TRIUMPH
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50025 NOBODY TALKED TO RONNIE
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50026 THEY SAID OKAY AND THEY NBSP DID
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50027 AND HE FOUND SOMEBODY

trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50029 SHE CAME IN DRAGGED HIM IN SOMEBODY HAD BEEN WORKING HER DOG NBSP HAD DIED AND SHE WAS CRYING
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50030 AND HE SAID I M NBSP SORRY
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50031 THEN THEY WERE DONE THEY HUGGED EACH OTHER THEY WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM THEY WERE SO HAPPY
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50032 SOMEBODY LOOKED AT THEM AND SAID WHAT A PAIR OF DINGBATS
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50033 WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE WANT
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50034 I WENT AROUND NBSP THE COUNTRY DIDN'T MAKE MONEY BUT I HAD A LOT OF FUN
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50036 A WOMAN RAISED HER HAND AND SAID PATRICK SWAYZE'S MOTHER HAS A RESORT 30 MILES AWAY I WORK THERE WEEKENDS

trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50038 I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU ABOUT WISH AND OBSTACLE THAT IS THE SECRET
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50041 I CAN'T DO IT
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50042 SHE SAID MY BROTHER HAS A BIG STAND OF THOSE IN AUSTRALIA
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50043 COME BACK HERE I LL GIVE YOU HIS NUMBER
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50044 I SAID WHAT

trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50047 YOU WANT TO RENT
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50048 SO HERE'S WHAT YOU DO
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50049 WE HAD A GROUP WITH SIX PEOPLE THERE WERE FIVE WOMEN AND THIS GUY
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50050 BUT HE NEVER WANTED ANYTHING
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50051 FINALLY THEY SAID LISTEN YOU HAVE TO TELL US WHAT YOU WANT
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50052 WE CAN'T TAKE ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50053 I DON T KNOW IF THERE ARE COWBOYS

trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50056 SHE NBSP REMEMBERED HER ROOMMATE HAD AN UNCLE IN ALBERTA WHO WAS A RANCHER
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50059 HE SAID YEAH IF YOU HAD STEAK THIS MONTH SOMEWHERE THERE'S A COWBOY
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50060 HE WENT OUT HE BECAME A COWBOY AND HE DOES HIS TORONTO ACCOUNTS ON THE INTERNET
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50061 HER DAUGHTER'S GOING TO BECOME A TEACHER
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50062 EVERY TIME YOU MAKE SOMEONE ELSE S DREAM COME TRUE IT ECHOES
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50063 NO MAGICAL NEW AGE WAY IT ECHOES IN PRACTICAL WONDERFUL WAYS
trainval/H2rG4Dg6xyI/50064 YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO
trainval/H2vN2QXZGnc/50001 BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY A MINI TESTOSTERONE PEAK EVERY 2 TO 2
trainval/H2vN2QXZGnc/50003 MAYBE THE BEST WAY OR THE MATHEMATICS REVEALED THAT HAVING HIGH STANDARDS AND FINDING WAYS TO REACH FOR THOSE
trainval/H2vN2QXZGnc/50004 IMAGINE BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH CHARLIE SHEEN
trainval/H2vN2QXZGnc/50005 SO WITH PARTNERS WE CAN BEHAVE A BIT LIKE PROUD PARENTS
trainval/H2vN2QXZGnc/50008 IF YOU APPROXIMATE YOU'LL BE PRONE TO AN OVERESTIMATION
trainval/H2vN2QXZGnc/50009 SO IF YOU GET PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT LOVE AND THEN SOLVE PROBLEMS THEY'LL BE BETTER AT THE GLOBALIZATION
trainval/H2vN2QXZGnc/50010 EASY AS THAT
trainval/H2vN2QXZGnc/50011 NOW YOU SEE HOW I USED THE WORD APPROXIMATE
trainval/H2vN2QXZGnc/50012 THAT'S BECAUSE THE RAT DOESN'T HAVE SELF AWARENESS OR A LINGUISTIC ABILITY TO
trainval/H2vN2QXZGnc/50013 YOU SEE LANGUAGE IS MORE THAN JUST NAMING THINGS
trainval/H2vN2QXZGnc/50014 YOU SEE MATHEMATICS LIES RIGHT AT THE ROOTS OF HUMANITY
trainval/H3TFShI7zKc/50001 HE LIVES ALL THE WAY IN L
trainval/H3TFShI7zKc/50002 THAT'S THE MAJOR THREAD
trainval/H3TFShI7zKc/50003 IT'S BEEN SAMPLED 547 TIMES
trainval/H3TFShI7zKc/50004 SNOOP DOGGY DOGG COVERS THIS SONG ON HIS DEBUT ALBUM DOGGYSTYLE AND CALLS IT LODI DODI
trainval/H3TFShI7zKc/50005 AND THEN YOU FAST FORWARD TO 1997 AND THE NOTORIOUS B
trainval/H3TFShI7zKc/50007 THESE RECORDS DON'T REALLY AGE THAT WELL
trainval/H3YbZsStuSI/50001 POOR CHOICES DON'T LEAD TO POVERTY
trainval/H3YbZsStuSI/50002 AND IT'S NOT JUST MY OWN FAMILY
trainval/H3YbZsStuSI/50003 IN FACT IT ENCOURAGES ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND ALLOWS PEOPLE TO CONTINUE THEIR SCHOOLING
trainval/H3YbZsStuSI/50004 AND THE STORY OF THE LAST THREE DECADES HAS BEEN THE SLOW DISAPPEARANCE OF THOSE JOBS
trainval/H3YbZsStuSI/50005 THE ASSOCIATED PRESS USES SOFTWARE TO WRITE 3000 FINANCIAL REPORTS EVERY
trainval/H3YbZsStuSI/50006 WE CAN NO LONGER PRETEND THAT THE JOBS OF THE PAST ARE GOING TO COME BACK OR THAT EMPLOYMENT WILL BE ENOUGH
trainval/H4Fwn3RHa14/50001 I WOULD DO THIS
trainval/h4GEMYsrJSY/50001 THE QUESTIONS BEGAN TO FEEL INTERROGATIVE
trainval/h4GEMYsrJSY/50002 I NEVER NEEDED BIOLOGY TO FORM FAMILY ANYWAY
trainval/H4iRPytrnJo/50001 NOW A FOURTH FACTOR REALLY BECOMES AN OBSESSION WHICH IS NEVER BETRAY
trainval/h4MhbkWJzKk/50002 THAT'S AN OUTRAGEOUS AND RIDICULOUS FINDING BUT IT'S TRUE
trainval/h4MhbkWJzKk/50003 SO PEOPLE SET ABOUT DOING TRIALS OF THE NEW DRUGS AGAINST THE OLD DRUGS
trainval/h4MhbkWJzKk/50004 AGAIN NOT AN INSANE DOSE NOT AN ILLEGAL DOSE BUT VERY MUCH AT THE HIGH END OF NORMAL
trainval/h4MhbkWJzKk/50005 IT'S AT THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID OF EVIDENCE
trainval/h4MhbkWJzKk/50006 WE NEED TO HAVE ALL OF THE DATA ON A PARTICULAR TREATMENT TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT IT REALLY IS EFFECTIVE
trainval/h4MhbkWJzKk/50007 AND YOU CAN GET LICENSED TO BRING YOUR DRUG TO MARKET WITH ONLY DATA SHOWING THAT IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING WHICH IS USELESS FOR A DOCTOR
trainval/h4MhbkWJzKk/50008 I READ THE TRIALS ON THIS
trainval/h4MhbkWJzKk/50010 THE COCHRANE GROUPS ARE AN INTERNATIONAL NONPROFIT COLLABORATION THAT PRODUCE SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF ALL OF THE DATA THAT
trainval/h4MhbkWJzKk/50011 AND THEY NEED TO HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THE TRIAL DATA
trainval/h4MhbkWJzKk/50012 SO DID THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY FOR THREE YEARS
trainval/h4MhbkWJzKk/50013 THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT IS CURRENTLY LACKING A SOLUTION
trainval/h4MhbkWJzKk/50014 BUT I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT GOVERNMENTS DON'T CARE
trainval/h4MhbkWJzKk/50015 WE STOCKPILE THEM FOR EMERGENCIES ON THE UNDERSTANDING THEY'LL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF COMPLICATIONS WHICH MEANS PNEUMONIA AND DEATH
trainval/h4MhbkWJzKk/50016 THE INFECTIOUS DISEASES COCHRANE GROUP WHICH ARE BASED IN ITALY HAS BEEN TRYING TO GET THE FULL DATA IN A USABLE
trainval/H50eCfpquBI/50001 SO WHERE TO BEGIN
trainval/H50eCfpquBI/50002 WELL FOR ME IT BEGINS WITH PHASING OUT ONE WORD
trainval/H50eCfpquBI/50003 THERE'S EVEN AN ORGANIZATION CALLED WOMEN AGAINST FEMINISM AND WHILE THEY HAVE A LOT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT
trainval/H50eCfpquBI/50004 THEY DON'T WANT WHAT THEY CALL RADICAL FEMINISTS' TELLING THEM WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT DO
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50001 WE'VE HEARD INTERVIEWS OFTEN IN WHICH A GUEST IS TALKING FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AND THEN THE HOST COMES BACK IN AND
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50002 AND WE DO THE EXACT SAME THING
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50003 WE'RE SITTING THERE HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE AND THEN WE REMEMBER THAT TIME THAT WE MET HUGH JACKMAN IN A COFFEE
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50004 YOU NEED TO LET THEM COME AND LET THEM GO
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50005 PEW RESEARCH DID A STUDY OF 10000 AMERICAN ADULTS AND THEY FOUND THAT AT THIS MOMENT WE ARE MORE POLARIZED WE ARE MORE
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50006 IF YOU DON'T KNOW SAY THAT YOU DON'T KNOW
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50007 NOW PEOPLE ON THE RADIO ESPECIALLY ON NPR ARE MUCH MORE AWARE THAT THEY'RE GOING ON THE RECORD AND SO THEY'RE MORE
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50008 ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50009 AGAIN THAT MEANS WE'RE NOT LISTENING TO EACH OTHER
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50010 A CONVERSATION REQUIRES A BALANCE BETWEEN TALKING AND LISTENING AND SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY WE LOST THAT BALANCE
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50011 ACCORDING TO PEW RESEARCH ABOUT A THIRD OF AMERICAN TEENAGERS SEND MORE THAN A HUNDRED
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50012 AND MANY OF THEM ALMOST MOST OF THEM ARE MORE LIKELY TO TEXT THEIR FRIENDS THAN THEY ARE TO TALK TO THEM FACE TO
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50013 THERE'S THIS GREAT PIECE IN THE ATLANTIC
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50014 IT WAS WRITTEN BY A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER NAMED PAUL BARNWELL
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50015 AND HE GAVE HIS KIDS A COMMUNICATION PROJECT
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50016 AND HE SAID THIS
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50017 I CAME TO REALIZE
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50018 NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS TRUCK DRIVERS BILLIONAIRES KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS HEADS OF STATE
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50019 I TALK TO PEOPLE THAT I LIKE
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50020 I TALK TO PEOPLE THAT I DON'T LIKE
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50021 I TALK TO SOME PEOPLE THAT I DISAGREE WITH DEEPLY ON A PERSONAL LEVEL
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50022 BUT I STILL HAVE A GREAT CONVERSATION WITH THEM
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50023 SO I WANT YOU TO FORGET ALL OF THAT
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50024 LEARN TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITHOUT WASTING YOUR TIME WITHOUT GETTING BORED AND PLEASE GOD WITHOUT
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50025 WE'VE HAD THEM BEFORE
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50026 WE KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50027 THE KIND OF CONVERSATION WHERE YOU WALK AWAY FEELING ENGAGED AND INSPIRED OR WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'VE MADE A REAL
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50028 THERE IS NO REASON WHY MOST OF YOUR INTERACTIONS CAN'T BE LIKE THAT
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50029 SO I HAVE 10 BASIC RULES
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50030 AND I DON'T MEAN JUST SET DOWN YOUR CELL PHONE OR YOUR TABLET OR YOUR CAR KEYS OR WHATEVER IS IN YOUR HAND
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50031 I MEAN BE PRESENT
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50032 DON'T THINK ABOUT YOUR ARGUMENT YOU HAD WITH YOUR BOSS
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50033 DON'T THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE FOR DINNER
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50034 IF YOU WANT TO STATE YOUR OPINION WITHOUT ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR RESPONSE OR ARGUMENT
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50035 STICK TO THE WEATHER AND YOUR HEALTH
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50036 THE FAMED THERAPIST M
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50037 SCOTT PECK SAID THAT TRUE LISTENING REQUIRES A SETTING ASIDE OF ONESELF
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50038 YES I WAS VERY ANGRY
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50039 LET THEM DESCRIBE IT
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50040 THEY'RE THE ONES THAT KNOW
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50041 TRY ASKING THEM THINGS LIKE WHAT WAS THAT LIKE
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50042 BECAUSE THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE TO STOP FOR A MOMENT AND THINK ABOUT IT AND YOU'RE GOING TO GET A MUCH MORE
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50043 THAT MEANS THOUGHTS WILL COME INTO YOUR MIND AND YOU NEED TO LET THEM GO OUT OF YOUR MIND
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50044 SOMEBODY ASKED STEPHEN HAWKING ONCE WHAT HIS IQ WAS AND HE SAID I HAVE NO IDEA
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50045 PEOPLE WHO BRAG ABOUT THEIR IQS ARE LOSERS
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50046 DON'T EQUATE YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH THEIRS
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50047 THEY DON'T CARE
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50048 WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT IS YOU
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50049 SO FORGET THE DETAILS
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50050 LEAVE THEM OUT
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50051 AND CALVIN COOLIDGE SAID NO MAN EVER LISTENED HIS WAY OUT OF A JOB
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50052 I'M THE CENTER OF ATTENTION
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50053 I CAN BOLSTER MY OWN IDENTITY
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50054 BUT THERE'S ANOTHER REASON
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50055 WE GET DISTRACTED
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50056 SO OUR MINDS ARE FILLING IN THOSE OTHER 275 WORDS
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50057 AND LOOK I KNOW IT TAKES EFFORT AND ENERGY TO ACTUALLY PAY ATTENTION TO SOMEONE BUT IF YOU
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50058 STEPHEN COVEY SAID IT VERY BEAUTIFULLY
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50059 ONE MORE RULE NUMBER 10 AND IT'S THIS ONE
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50060 IT IS NEVER THE SAME
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50061 HE WAS THE MAYOR OF SACRAMENTO
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50062 SHE WON A PULITZER PRIZE
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50063 ALL EXPERIENCES ARE INDIVIDUAL
trainval/H6n3iNh4XLI/50064 AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IT IS NOT ABOUT YOU
trainval/H74XsXCjKA8/50001 THIS IS WHERE INTERNALIZED MISOGYNY COMES IN
trainval/H74XsXCjKA8/50002 YOU CAN HELP TOO WHETHER YOU ARE A FATHER BROTHER HUSBAND OR SON YOU CAN HELP BY EMPOWERING WOMEN
trainval/H7Gn2a0GnAc/50001 NEITHER OF MY PARENTS EVER CONFORMED TO TRADITIONAL GENDER ROLES
trainval/H7Gn2a0GnAc/50002 THEY BOTH BROUGHT MY BROTHER AND I UP
trainval/H7Gn2a0GnAc/50003 THEY BOTH WORKED
trainval/H7Gn2a0GnAc/50004 IT'S NOT A REDUCTIVE LABEL
trainval/h7qKzqQnjXw/50001 AND WE'VE MADE GREAT THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL ADVANCES IN HOW TO DEAL WITH HOW TO UNDERSTAND AND IN HOW
trainval/h7qKzqQnjXw/50003 MAYBE WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT
trainval/h7qKzqQnjXw/50004 THAT SOUNDS AT BEST IMPOSSIBLE
trainval/h7qKzqQnjXw/50005 WHILE AT WORST IT SOUNDS LIKE MANIPULATION
trainval/h7u6NScSWtY/50001 IT HAD TO HAVE A RIDER
trainval/h8cF5QPPmWU/50001 IT'S CALLED A MICROSCOPE
trainval/h8cF5QPPmWU/50002 ANOTHER FUN FACT IS THIS IS WHAT WE ACTUALLY SEND OUT THERE AS A STANDARD DIAGNOSTIC TOOL
trainval/h8cF5QPPmWU/50003 WE ARE STARTING AT THE END OF THE SUMMER
trainval/h8cF5QPPmWU/50004 WE ARE AT A STAGE WHERE WE'LL BE MAKING THOUSANDS OF MICROSCOPES
trainval/H8Pr9Jnulxk/50001 WHILE DARK MATTER CAPTURED THE WORLD'S IMAGINATION OVERNIGHT IT REMAINS ONE OF THE GREATEST UNSOLVED MYSTERIES OF ALL
trainval/H8Pr9Jnulxk/50002 LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT WHAT YOU CANNOT SEE
trainval/H8Pr9Jnulxk/50003 DARK MATTER IS UNLIKE ANYTHING WE'VE EVER SEEN
trainval/H8Pr9Jnulxk/50004 ONE OF THESE PERPLEXITIES WAS THE EVOLUTION OF WOMEN AS A SO CALLED SUBSTANDARD
trainval/H8Pr9Jnulxk/50005 THE FACT THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR WORLD HISTORY A FEMALE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LOST DOES NOT
trainval/H8Pr9Jnulxk/50006 BOHR SAID TO WOLFGANG PAULI AFTER HIS PRESENTATION OF HEISENBERG'S AND PAULI'S NON LINEAR FIELD THEORY OF
trainval/H8Pr9Jnulxk/50007 AND I ASK BACK AT YOU WHY NOT
trainval/H8Pr9Jnulxk/50008 LOOK WHAT WOMEN AND DARK MATTER HAVE IN COMMON
trainval/H8Pr9Jnulxk/50009 LIKE THAT COMET THAT TRANSFORMED AND UPSET OUR WORLD FOREVER SO TOO WILL WOMEN CREATE CHANGE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN
trainval/H8Pr9Jnulxk/50010 IT CONNECTS IT GOES TWO WAYS MANY WAYS AN EXCHANGE A NETWORK
trainval/h9deGh8StEc/50001 HE TOOK COLLEGE CREDIT COURSES SO WHEN HE GOT OUT HE WAS ABLE TO GET A MASTER'S AND TODAY HE'S A MANAGER AT
trainval/h9SKyrHRhDo/50001 NOW YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT THE PORCUPINE CARIBOU HERD IN THE CONTEXT OF ITS BREEDING GROUND IN ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE
trainval/h9SKyrHRhDo/50002 WELL THE WINTERING GROUND IS ALSO CRITICAL AND IT ALSO IS NOT PROTECTED AND IS POTENTIALLY
trainval/h9SKyrHRhDo/50003 I DID THE MATH
trainval/h9SKyrHRhDo/50004 THAT'S NOT A BAD SIZE HOME
trainval/h9SKyrHRhDo/50005 THE OTHER METHOD OF EXTRACTION IS WHAT'S CALLED THE IN SITU
trainval/h9SKyrHRhDo/50006 SO THEY DECIDED TO CALL IT OIL SANDS
trainval/h9SKyrHRhDo/50007 AND THE ATHABASCA RIVER DRAINS DOWNSTREAM TO A RANGE OF ABORIGINAL COMMUNITIES
trainval/h9SKyrHRhDo/50008 IN FORT CHIPEWYAN THE 800 PEOPLE THERE ARE FINDING TOXINS IN THE FOOD CHAIN THIS HAS BEEN SCIENTIFICALLY
trainval/h9SKyrHRhDo/50009 THIS MIGHT BE WHAT
trainval/h9SKyrHRhDo/50010 THANK YOU SO MUCH
trainval/h9x2SWgwhY4/50001 A HOTEL HOLDS THE PROMISE EVERY DAY OF ADVENTURE AND ROMANCE INTRIGUE
trainval/h9x2SWgwhY4/50002 IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT WE TOOK THIS HOTEL WHICH WAS BUILT IN THE HEIGHT OF ASPEN'S SILVER BOOM
trainval/h9x2SWgwhY4/50003 I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH THIS FINAL THOUGHT
trainval/h9x2SWgwhY4/50004 IN SOME CASES THE MOST INNOVATIVE AND URBAN HOTELS HAVE BEGUN TO DEFINE THEIR
trainval/h9x2SWgwhY4/50005 TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE ACE HOTELS IN NEW YORK AND PORTLAND
trainval/HA7GwKXfJB0/50001 AND IF THAT WERE SUCCESSFUL THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST EXAMPLE OF READING A MEMORY FROM A CONNECTOME
trainval/HA7GwKXfJB0/50002 I PROPOSE THAT WE ATTEMPT TO FIND A CONNECTOME OF A FROZEN BRAIN
trainval/HA7GwKXfJB0/50003 WE KNOW THAT DAMAGE TO THE BRAIN OCCURS AFTER DEATH AND DURING FREEZING
trainval/HA7GwKXfJB0/50004 IF IT HAS THERE IS NO WAY THAT ANY FUTURE CIVILIZATION WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER THE MEMORIES OF THESE FROZEN BRAINS
trainval/haA6QtH0PIc/50001 IT'S SOMETHING YOU ENGAGE WITH
trainval/haA6QtH0PIc/50002 SO THIS IS THE TRUE CHALLENGE TO PUBLIC SPACE
trainval/haA6QtH0PIc/50003 IT'S OUR RIGHT
trainval/HaHeAdJNa70/50001 HE CAME UP WITH A NAME FOR HIS MYSTERY AGENT
trainval/HaHeAdJNa70/50002 THAT PERHAPS WILL ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSE OF A CANCER THAT AFFLICTS US OR IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OF AN
trainval/HAKea48B3oM/50001 LET'S TRY ANOTHER ONE SO HERE'S A SECOND EXAMPLE
trainval/HAKea48B3oM/50003 WHO SAYS IF THERE'S EXPENSIVE CLOTHING I'M GOING TO DONATE A SMALLER AMOUNT
trainval/HAKea48B3oM/50004 IS THERE A LOGO OR NO LOGO
trainval/HAKea48B3oM/50005 AND THE AUDIENCE ME MYSELF AS WELL WE'RE COMPLETELY OFF
trainval/HAKea48B3oM/50006 AND THEY WERE ASKED TO RATE THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THE PICTURES
trainval/HAKea48B3oM/50008 SO WHAT WE DO IN OUR LABORATORY IS WE TEST TV COMMERCIALS AND WE MONITOR ACTIVITY IN THE
trainval/HAKea48B3oM/50009 BUT WHY DO WE DO IT
trainval/HALd9FY5SVQ/50001 HE ALSO TOLD ME ABOUT THE GREAT EXPLORERS
trainval/HALd9FY5SVQ/50002 THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THAT PLACE WHICH DREW ME TO IT
trainval/HALd9FY5SVQ/50003 AND PERHAPS THE BEST PLACE TO START IS WITH MY LATE FATHER
trainval/HALd9FY5SVQ/50004 AND THE WATER AT THE NORTH POLE IS MINUS 1
trainval/HALd9FY5SVQ/50005 BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WAS TO TRAIN MY MIND TO PREPARE MYSELF FOR WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN
trainval/HALd9FY5SVQ/50006 AND I HAD TO VISUALIZE THE SWIM
trainval/HALd9FY5SVQ/50007 I HAD TO TASTE THE SALT WATER IN MY MOUTH
trainval/HALd9FY5SVQ/50008 AND SO I LITERALLY SWAM ACROSS THE NORTH POLE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF TIMES IN MY MIND
trainval/HALd9FY5SVQ/50009 SO WE STOPPED THE SHIP AS YOU DO
trainval/HALd9FY5SVQ/50010 I COULD BARELY BREATHE
trainval/HALd9FY5SVQ/50011 I WAS GASPING FOR AIR
trainval/HALd9FY5SVQ/50012 I WAS HYPERVENTILATING SO MUCH AND WITHIN SECONDS MY HANDS WERE NUMB
trainval/HALd9FY5SVQ/50013 AND SO WHAT HAD ACTUALLY HAPPENED IS THAT THE CELLS IN MY FINGERS HAD FROZEN AND EXPANDED
trainval/HALd9FY5SVQ/50014 AND THIS DREAM WHICH I HAD HAD EVER SINCE I WAS A YOUNG BOY WITH MY FATHER WAS JUST GOING OUT THE
trainval/HALd9FY5SVQ/50015 A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO HE TRIED TO SKI ALL THE WAY TO THE NORTH POLE
trainval/HALd9FY5SVQ/50016 WE ARE GOING TO ACTUALLY HAVE TO TAKE THEM OFF
trainval/HALd9FY5SVQ/50017 THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT SWIM
trainval/HALd9FY5SVQ/50018 AT THE VERY BEST I'M GOING TO END UP LOSING SOME FINGERS
trainval/HALd9FY5SVQ/50019 I HAD NEVER SEEN BLACK WATER BEFORE
trainval/HALd9FY5SVQ/50020 WE CARRIED ON SAILING THROUGH THE ICE PACKS TOWARDS THE NORTH POLE
trainval/HALd9FY5SVQ/50021 I SO BELIEVE IN YOU LEWIS
trainval/HALd9FY5SVQ/50022 I'VE SEEN THE WAY YOU'VE BEEN TRAINING
trainval/HALd9FY5SVQ/50023 AND I REALIZE THE REASON WHY YOU'RE GOING TO DO THIS
trainval/HALd9FY5SVQ/50024 BUT WAS IT WORTH IT
trainval/HALd9FY5SVQ/50025 WE'VE COME A LONG WAY
trainval/haTsrKptgIU/50001 IS MY STORY
trainval/haTsrKptgIU/50002 AND I LOVE D
trainval/haTsrKptgIU/50003 IMAGINE WHAT THEY COULD DO
trainval/haTsrKptgIU/50004 NOW THE QUESTION IS
trainval/haTsrKptgIU/50005 IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT IT'S CALLED
trainval/haTsrKptgIU/50006 THEY GET TO LEAD
trainval/haTsrKptgIU/50007 HAS ANYONE EVER NOTICED THAT IN THEIR OWN LIVES
trainval/haTsrKptgIU/50008 THEY ARE INTERDEPENDENT CO DEPENDENT WITH THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE
trainval/haTsrKptgIU/50009 IT IS NOT A DIFFERENT THING THAN THE WORK OF SCHOOL IT IS THE WORK OF SCHOOL AS MUCH AS TEACHING MATH READING AND SCIENCE
trainval/haTsrKptgIU/50010 IT CAN HAPPEN OUTSIDE SCHOOL JUST AS WELL
trainval/haTsrKptgIU/50011 IT CHANGED THE POSSIBILITIES REALLY IMPORTANT
trainval/haTsrKptgIU/50012 WE AT CHAN ZUCKERBERG CAN DO SOME THINGS
trainval/HB2SlA68YDU/50001 I WANTED HER JUST TO GET BETTER
trainval/HB2SlA68YDU/50002 I REMEMBER GOING TO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND MAKING SURE SURE THEY INSTALLED THE CAR SEAT SAFELY
trainval/HB2SlA68YDU/50003 I WAS THE HAPPIEST FATHER ON EARTH
trainval/HB2SlA68YDU/50004 I WAS BRINGING MY BABY GIRL HOME
trainval/HB2SlA68YDU/50005 I WAS OVERWHELMED
trainval/HB2SlA68YDU/50006 HOW AM I GOING TO COME UP WITH THIS MONEY IN ORDER TO PROVIDE FOR MY DAUGHTER
trainval/HB2SlA68YDU/50007 NOT SURE ANYBODY KNOWS HOW IT FEELS TO NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR YOUR DAUGHTER ON CHRISTMAS ONE OF
trainval/HB2SlA68YDU/50008 I JUST KNEW I HAD TO STOP AND GET MYSELF OUT OF PAIN
trainval/HB2SlA68YDU/50009 I'VE NEVER EVEN BEEN TO THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE
trainval/HB2SlA68YDU/50010 I'D BEEN SUPERMAN MY WHOLE LIFE
trainval/hbG89FYKzaY/50001 I FOUND WHERE SEVERAL PEOPLE APPARENTLY HAVE SAID IT THROUGHOUT HISTORY EVEN AS FAR BACK AS THE ROMAN
trainval/hbG89FYKzaY/50002 LIKE MOST OF YOU I'VE BEEN HEARING IT MOST OF MY LIFE AND MOST RECENTLY WHILE WATCHING
trainval/hbG89FYKzaY/50003 NOT GOING TO GO THERE
trainval/hbG89FYKzaY/50004 HOW MANY OF YOU ACTUALLY DO THAT EACH DAY
trainval/hbG89FYKzaY/50005 THERE ARE A FEW THINGS ABOUT LIVING EACH DAY LIKE IT'S YOUR LAST THAT DON'T MAKE SENSE TO ME
trainval/hbG89FYKzaY/50006 I KNOW THAT IF I SAY I HAVE GOT TO VERSUS I REALLY WANT YOU MY ENTIRE PHYSIOLOGY
trainval/hbG89FYKzaY/50007 TO HEAR HER TELL THE STORY SHE WOKE UP ON THAT MORNING AND SAID UH
trainval/hbG89FYKzaY/50008 AND SEEING THE WORLD THROUGH HER EYES REALLY WAS KIND OF LIKE SEEING IT THROUGH THE EYES OF A CHILD
trainval/hbG89FYKzaY/50009 YES I DO THINK THAT KNOWING WE ARE GOING TO DIE SOMEDAY CAN BE A MOTIVATOR FOR SOME
trainval/hbG89FYKzaY/50010 AND HER ONE THROUGH FIVE GAVE HER JOY REGARDLESS OF OUTCOME
trainval/hbG89FYKzaY/50011 IF WE LIVE EACH DAY FULL OF WONDER AND APPRECIATION WHILE DISCOVERING A
trainval/hbG89FYKzaY/50012 AND JANESSA STARTED WRITING AGAIN AFTER DAY 181 BECAUSE THERE WERE MORE DAYS ON THE
trainval/hbG89FYKzaY/50013 WHAT A GIFT FUTURE DAYS ARE
trainval/hbG89FYKzaY/50014 SHE STARTED WRITING AGAIN
trainval/hbG89FYKzaY/50015 SO I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE CAN DEAL WITH DAY TO DAY ROUTINE AND RESPONSIBILITY WHILE PURSUING OUR
trainval/hbG89FYKzaY/50016 IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ALL OR NOTHING
trainval/hbG89FYKzaY/50017 I NOW LOOK IN THE MIRROR EACH MORNING AND I ASK MYSELF IF TODAY WERE THE FIRST DAY
trainval/hbG89FYKzaY/50018 HAVE YOU SEEN THEM
trainval/hBOVuIIQUFc/50001 I WANT THAT CHECKED
trainval/HbQZ7jAvgoI/50001 HOW DOES HE HAVE SEX
trainval/HbQZ7jAvgoI/50002 OK OK LET'S STOP THOSE HYPOTHETICAL QUESTIONS BEFORE WE GET TOO CLOSE FOR MY COMFORT
trainval/HbQZ7jAvgoI/50003 BEING TRANS IS AWKWARD BECAUSE EVERYONE ELSE GETS AWKWARD WHEN THEY'RE AROUND ME
trainval/HbQZ7jAvgoI/50004 IT'S A BLAST
trainval/HbQZ7jAvgoI/50005 AND OFTEN WE OPT TO JUST NOT GO TO THE BATHROOM AT ALL
trainval/HbQZ7jAvgoI/50006 OH NOW I'M LOOKING AT HIS CROTCH
trainval/HBSQR6xovSw/50001 A SPEAKER'S ART IS THE EFFECTIVE DELIVERY OF THE SPOKEN WORD
trainval/HBSQR6xovSw/50002 AND BY THE WAY I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE KIND OF PERFORMANCE WHERE YOU GO ALL OUT ON STAGE IN FRONT OF THE AUDIENCE AND ACT
trainval/HBSQR6xovSw/50003 I CALL IT PUTTING ON A NEW HAT
trainval/HBSQR6xovSw/50004 A HAT FOR EVERY OCCASION
trainval/HBSQR6xovSw/50005 YOU MAY KNOW IT FROM THE CAT AND THE HAT
trainval/HBSQR6xovSw/50006 I LOVE THIS HAT
trainval/hBtXiTumdY0/50001 HE MAKES HER A COFFEE BUT SHE IS COMPLETELY WIPED OUT
trainval/hBtXiTumdY0/50002 SO THAT IS WHAT SHE DOES
trainval/hBtXiTumdY0/50003 TODAY I AM GOING TO TALK TO YOU PRECISELY ABOUT HOW OUR UNDERSTANDING OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
trainval/hBtXiTumdY0/50004 BLURRED LINES INDEED
trainval/hBtXiTumdY0/50005 RAPE AND ABUSE IS ALSO USED AS A USEFUL PLOT TWIST IN SOME OF THE MOST HIGHLY RATED SHOWS ON
trainval/hBtXiTumdY0/50006 APPARENTLY SOME WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE DEGREES OF RAPE
trainval/hBtXiTumdY0/50007 EVERYONE OF THOSE PEOPLE TALKS TO A FEW PEOPLE
trainval/HByDu4uOFY4/50001 MY FIRST ALBUM WAS RECEIVED VERY WELL IN COLOMBIA
trainval/HByDu4uOFY4/50002 INSTEAD OF SAYING A DUTCH GIRL PLAYING SALSA THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT
trainval/Hc6yiSFtoNo/50001 THE FIRST SON TOOK HIS HALF HALF OF 18 IS NINE
trainval/Hc6yiSFtoNo/50002 THAT'S THE QUESTION
trainval/Hc6yiSFtoNo/50003 AND I THINK I'VE FOUND IN SOME WAYS WHAT IS THE SECRET TO PEACE
trainval/Hc6yiSFtoNo/50004 WHAT DO I KNOW ABOUT PUERTO RICO
trainval/Hc6yiSFtoNo/50005 SO THEN THEY HAD 18 CAMELS
trainval/Hc6yiSFtoNo/50006 NOW AS ANTHROPOLOGISTS WE KNOW THAT EVERY CULTURE HAS AN ORIGIN STORY
trainval/Hc6yiSFtoNo/50007 HIS BASIC MESSAGE WAS UNITY TOO THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF IT ALL THE UNITY OF IT ALL
trainval/Hc6yiSFtoNo/50009 WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN
trainval/Hc6yiSFtoNo/50010 WHAT IS THE STORY THERE
trainval/Hc6yiSFtoNo/50011 AND SO SHE TOLD OUR TEAM THERE SHE SAID YOU HAVE MADE ME VISIBLE
trainval/Hc6yiSFtoNo/50012 WE'RE ABOUT TO TAKE A BREAK IN A MOMENT
trainval/Hc6yiSFtoNo/50013 THAT'S A THIRD SIDE ACT
trainval/Hc6yiSFtoNo/50014 THAT'S WALKING ABRAHAM'S PATH
trainval/Hc6yiSFtoNo/50015 THE PATH RIGHT NOW IS LIKE AN ACORN IT'S STILL IN ITS EARLY PHASE
trainval/Hc6yiSFtoNo/50016 WHAT WOULD THE OAK TREE LOOK LIKE
trainval/HCG1petekXw/50001 I WENT TO A WOMEN'S COLLEGE SMITH COLLEGE
trainval/HCG1petekXw/50002 AND I WAS VERY FORTUNATE TO SPEND FOUR YEARS INSIDE OF THAT
trainval/HCG1petekXw/50003 AND TO HELP THEM EXPAND THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD AND THE
trainval/HCG1petekXw/50004 HERE IS WHAT WE KNOW
trainval/HCG1petekXw/50005 WE KNOW THAT EDUCATION IS THE TRULY TRANSFORMATIVE THING THAT HELPS PEOPLE LEAVE
trainval/HCG1petekXw/50006 AND ALMOST OVERNIGHT IT BECAME ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A COLLEGE EDUCATION IF YOU WERE
trainval/HCG1petekXw/50007 THEY ALSO MADE AN INDELIBLE IMPRESSION ON ME ABOUT THE DRAMATIC
trainval/HCG1petekXw/50008 BUT WOULDN'T IT HAVE MADE MORE SENSE FOR THEM TO DO THAT WHILE THEY WERE LOCKED UP IN PRISON
trainval/HCG1petekXw/50009 IN THIS COUNTRY THERE ARE SOME EXCELLENT COLLEGE EDUCATION PROGRAMS BUT
trainval/HCG1petekXw/50010 WE ALSO NEED THE THOUSANDS OF COLLEGES AND
trainval/HCG1petekXw/50011 PEOPLE ASK ME SOMETIMES
trainval/HCG1petekXw/50012 CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT
trainval/HCG1petekXw/50013 THAT IS HOW MUCH IT TRANSFORMS WHO YOU ARE AS A PERSON
trainval/HCG1petekXw/50014 IT CHANGES THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT YOURSELF
trainval/HCG1petekXw/50015 IT CHANGES THE WAY THAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE WORLD AND IT CHANGES THE WAY THAT YOU SOLVE
trainval/HCG1petekXw/50016 IF WE WANT PEOPLE IN PRISON TO CHANGE THEY MUST GET
trainval/HCG1petekXw/50017 THEY GOT THEIR COLLEGE EDUCATION AGAINST VERY TOUGH ODDS AND THEY MADE AMAZING LIVES FOR
trainval/HCgvSHNoJrY/50001 4 PERCENT OF THE ENTIRE LAND SURFACE ALREADY PROVIDES FOR 35 PERCENT OF THE
trainval/HCgvSHNoJrY/50002 WHILE WE MAY NOT BE SURE ONE THING IS CERTAIN WE WILL NOT WANT THIS PLANT TO DISAPPEAR
trainval/HCgvSHNoJrY/50003 IT'S A PLANT
trainval/hcIpbUsIVKw/50001 I'M SURE YOU'RE GUESSING WHERE I'M GOING NOW
trainval/HCJRXoYOoaI/50001 WE COMBINE IT WITH A CARBON SOURCE MAINLY LEAF WASTE
trainval/HCJRXoYOoaI/50002 THEY SAY DO YOU ADD AN OUTSIDE HEATING ELEMENT
trainval/HCJRXoYOoaI/50003 I WENT TO COMPOST SCHOOL
trainval/HCJRXoYOoaI/50004 THIS MAKES SENSE
trainval/HCJRXoYOoaI/50005 YOU'RE AN ALCHEMIST
trainval/HCJRXoYOoaI/50006 YOU NEED THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF CARBON WHICH IS THE DEAD BROWN STUFF
trainval/HCJRXoYOoaI/50007 THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF OXYGEN AND THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF MOISTURE LIKE A WRUNG OUT SPONGE
trainval/HCJRXoYOoaI/50008 WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT FOR THESE MICROBES TO THRIVE
trainval/HCJRXoYOoaI/50009 I STARTED TO LOOK AT LITTLE THINGS AT THIS CAFE WE COULD DO TO LESSEN OUR IMPACT
trainval/HCJRXoYOoaI/50010 NO YOU REALLY DON'T
trainval/HCJRXoYOoaI/50011 WE WERE DOING IT ALL BY HAND
trainval/HCJRXoYOoaI/50012 THIS IS THEIR A HA
trainval/HCJRXoYOoaI/50013 THERE'S A MAJOR ISSUE IN THIS COUNTRY WITH WASTE AT THE SOURCE
trainval/HCJRXoYOoaI/50014 WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT
trainval/hCop3IGZH2o/50001 IF WE WERE CAPTURED FIRST MY SISTER AND I THEN SHE AND MY GRANDMOTHER WOULD DRINK
trainval/hCop3IGZH2o/50002 AND FOR THAT WORK WHEN I WAS A FINAL YEAR LAW STUDENT I WAS CHOSEN AS THE YOUNG AUSTRALIAN OF THE YEAR
trainval/hCop3IGZH2o/50003 I LOOKED THROUGH THE SHOWER SCREEN AND SAW HER STANDING ON THE OTHER SIDE
trainval/hCop3IGZH2o/50004 I KNEW SHE HAD COME TO SAY GOODBYE
trainval/hCop3IGZH2o/50005 MY MOTHER PHONED MINUTES LATER
trainval/hCop3IGZH2o/50006 A FEW DAYS LATER WE WENT TO A BUDDHIST TEMPLE IN FOOTSCRAY AND SAT AROUND HER CASKET
trainval/hCop3IGZH2o/50007 WE TOLD HER STORIES AND ASSURED HER THAT WE WERE STILL WITH HER
trainval/hCop3IGZH2o/50008 SO I FOLLOWED MY HUNCHES
trainval/HcTtoGhn0Dc/50001 I THINK WE CAN SOLVE THIS IF WE THINK CREATIVELY IF WE STEP OUTSIDE OF THE BOX AND COME UP WITH AN ATYPICAL
trainval/HdHW77blulg/50001 HE TRANSLATED THE ACOUSTIC RADIANCE OF THE WHALE'S VOICE ITS SONG INTO A
trainval/HdHW77blulg/50002 THIS PHENOMENON WAS DETECTED BY THE U
trainval/HDjM5lw8OYo/50001 WE ALREADY CARRY A WORLD OF INFORMATION AROUND IN OUR POCKETS BUT IT SEEMS AS IF THE MORE INFORMATION WE
trainval/HDjM5lw8OYo/50002 OUR ONLINE LIFE IS PERSONALIZED EVERYTHING FROM THE ADS WE READ TO THE NEWS THAT COMES DOWN OUR FACEBOOK
trainval/HDjM5lw8OYo/50003 I DON'T THINK THAT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY IT IS A TECHNOLOGICAL PROBLEM
trainval/HDjM5lw8OYo/50004 I THINK IT'S A HUMAN PROBLEM HAVING TO DO WITH HOW WE THINK AND WHAT WE VALUE
trainval/HDjM5lw8OYo/50005 PROTAGORAS SAID THAT OBJECTIVE TRUTH WAS AN ILLUSION BECAUSE MAN IS THE MEASURE OF ALL THINGS
trainval/HDjM5lw8OYo/50006 BUT WOULD IT MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU TO KNOW WHAT'S TRUE
trainval/HDjM5lw8OYo/50007 WE AGREE THAT YOU CAN'T FLAP YOUR ARMS AND FLY
trainval/HDjM5lw8OYo/50008 THE SECOND THING CAN BE SUMMED UP BY THE LATIN PHRASE THAT KANT TOOK AS THE MOTTO FOR
trainval/HEFSHP2XE7E/50001 SO WAS MY MOM
trainval/HEFSHP2XE7E/50002 EPIGENETICS GIVES US A RATIONALE THAT WHAT WE EAT AND DO CAN NOT ONLY AFFECT
trainval/HEFSHP2XE7E/50003 THIS IS KEY BECAUSE IF WE CAN LEARN TO IDENTIFY DISEASE EARLIER WE CAN REVERSE AND
trainval/HEFSHP2XE7E/50004 BUT FAST FORWARD EVEN TODAY I WILL READILY ADMIT THAT IT IS SO MUCH
trainval/hFcQpNrSKA4/50001 YOU MIGHT WANT TO STRETCH AROUND A LITTLE BIT
trainval/hfDkDzZ9GsU/50001 SOMETHING THAT WOULD STICK TO THEIR RIBS SHE SAID
trainval/hfDkDzZ9GsU/50002 MY COUSINS ALL TEACH
trainval/hfDkDzZ9GsU/50003 NOW WHAT'S HARD TO PUT TOGETHER BUT IS TRUE IS THAT MANY TIMES THESE ARE THE SAME CHILDREN
trainval/hfDkDzZ9GsU/50004 BUT DONNA'S BIGGEST SUPPORTER CAME FROM AN UNEXPECTED PLACE
trainval/hfDkDzZ9GsU/50005 THANK YOU GUYS SO VERY MUCH
trainval/HFFBkbsSFY0/50001 WE NEEDED A BREAKTHROUGH
trainval/HFFBkbsSFY0/50002 YOU'VE SEEN THEM I THINK ON YACHTS RIGHT
trainval/HFFBkbsSFY0/50003 YOU'VE SEEN THESE THINGS ON BOATS
trainval/HFFBkbsSFY0/50004 IT'S THERE FOR US TO HAVE BUT WE'VE GOT TO SOLVE THIS CHOKE POINT AND IT'S GOING TO CHANGE YOUR LIVES SO IT'S WORTH
trainval/HFFBkbsSFY0/50005 IN FACT IT STARTED TO DRIVE THE RECALL THE COMPLEXITY OF THAT SOFTWARE STARTED TO DRIVE OUR RECALLS
trainval/HFFBkbsSFY0/50006 THIS IS A WONDERFUL THING FOR US
trainval/hFGLqkDnSVI/50001 HE TOLD ME HE WOULDN'T LEAVE THE FIELDS UNLESS HIS PARENTS CAME WITH HIM
trainval/hFGLqkDnSVI/50002 THAT I WOULD LET PEOPLE LIKE YOU HEAR HER STORY AND SO THIS MORNING I'M GOING TO HONOR THAT PROMISE AND I'M GOING TO
trainval/hFgPtuzgw4o/50001 DAI MANJU WAS IN SIXTH GRADE WHEN HER PARENTS SAID WE'RE GOING TO PULL YOU OUT OF SCHOOL BECAUSE THE
trainval/hFgPtuzgw4o/50002 SHE SCOUTED FOR JOBS DOWN IN GUANGDONG PROVINCE IN THE SOUTH
trainval/hFgPtuzgw4o/50003 AND THAT BRINGS ME TO MY FIRST MAJOR OF TWO TENETS OF HALF THE SKY
trainval/hFgPtuzgw4o/50004 BUT IN MOST OF THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT'S NOT THE CASE
trainval/hFgPtuzgw4o/50005 SOMETIMES IT'S ALSO BECAUSE OF THE SONOGRAM
trainval/hFgPtuzgw4o/50006 IT'S A WASTE OF RESOURCES IF YOU DON'T USE SOMEONE LIKE DAI MANJU
trainval/hFgPtuzgw4o/50007 DO YOU THINK WE'LL MAKE IT
trainval/hFgPtuzgw4o/50008 AND I'LL JUST SAY TWO THINGS ABOUT THIS
trainval/hFgPtuzgw4o/50009 TRANSPORTED FROM AFRICA TO THE NEW WORLD
trainval/hFgPtuzgw4o/50010 AROUND THE WORLD ONE WOMAN DIES EVERY MINUTE AND A HALF FROM CHILDBIRTH
trainval/hFgPtuzgw4o/50011 SHE WAS BEATEN EVERY SINGLE DAY BY HER HUSBAND WHO WAS UNEMPLOYED
trainval/hFgPtuzgw4o/50012 HEIFER SENT TWO GOATS TO AFRICA
trainval/hFgPtuzgw4o/50013 THEY SOLD THE MILK FOR CASH
trainval/hFgPtuzgw4o/50014 SHE ROCKETED TO THE TOP OF HER CLASS
trainval/hFgPtuzgw4o/50015 THE SECOND ITEM ON THE AGENDA IS MATERNAL MORTALITY
trainval/hFgPtuzgw4o/50016 AID HELPING PEOPLE IS NOT EASY AND THERE HAVE BEEN BOOKS THAT HAVE CRITICIZED U
trainval/hFgPtuzgw4o/50017 THERE'S A BOOK CALLED DEAD AID
trainval/hFgPtuzgw4o/50018 TURNS OUT THAT IT'S A FAILED IRRIGATION PROJECT
trainval/hFgPtuzgw4o/50019 YOU'RE PROBABLY ASKING THAT
trainval/hFgPtuzgw4o/50020 WHY SHOULD YOU CARE
trainval/HfMhU6qjVVM/50001 WE'RE WORKING ON WAYS TO FREQUENTLY ACTIVATE AN EARLY STAGE CANCER ALARM BY ENABLING
trainval/HfMhU6qjVVM/50002 AND BECAUSE THEY'RE ABUNDANTLY PRESENT IN JUST ABOUT EVERY BODILY FLUID INCLUDING BLOOD URINE AND SALIVA
trainval/HfMhU6qjVVM/50003 ONCE THOUGHT TO BE LITTLE BINS FOR UNWANTED CELLULAR WASTE IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT CELLS ACTUALLY
trainval/HfMhU6qjVVM/50004 WITH THE WORK THAT MY TEAM HAS ALREADY DONE ON SEPARATION OF NANOSCALE BIOMARKERS FOR RAPID EARLY STAGE
trainval/HfMhU6qjVVM/50005 AND WE HAVE DONE WITH IT WHAT THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY HAS DONE SO SUCCESSFULLY FOR THE PAST 50 YEARS
trainval/HfMhU6qjVVM/50006 WE SHRUNK THE DIMENSIONS OF THIS TECHNOLOGY FROM THE MICRON SCALE TO THE TRUE NANOSCALE
trainval/HfMhU6qjVVM/50007 SO HOW DOES IT WORK
trainval/HfotnZVEq80/50001 I ONLY GOT THREE MINUTES TO PREPARE THIS SO DON'T BE ALL SMUG WHEN I MAKE A MISTAKE
trainval/HfotnZVEq80/50002 BUT THE BEST TED TALKERS WILL NEVER BREAK
trainval/HfotnZVEq80/50003 THAT'S A FAVORITE
trainval/HFqLoHyCTRc/50001 IS IT OK TO CALL
trainval/HFqLoHyCTRc/50002 AND THESE ROVERS ARE OUR ROBOTIC EMISSARIES
trainval/HFqLoHyCTRc/50003 SO WE LEARN HOW TO OPERATE ON OTHER PLANETS THROUGH THESE ROVERS
trainval/HFqLoHyCTRc/50004 SO OUR DAY IS 24 HOURS
trainval/HFqLoHyCTRc/50005 OUR JOB THE JOB OF THIS TEAM OF WHICH I'M A PART OF IS TO SEND COMMANDS TO THE ROVER
trainval/HFqLoHyCTRc/50006 AND SO SHE SLEEPS
trainval/HFqLoHyCTRc/50007 THIS TEAM NEEDS TO BE AT WORK AT 5
trainval/HFqLoHyCTRc/50008 SO ONE DAY YOU COME IN AT 8
trainval/HFqLoHyCTRc/50009 40 THE NEXT DAY 40 MINUTES LATER AT 9
trainval/HFqLoHyCTRc/50010 20 THE NEXT DAY AT 10
trainval/HFqLoHyCTRc/50011 SO YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW CONFUSING THAT IS
trainval/HFqLoHyCTRc/50012 YEAH NOT SO MUCH
trainval/HFqLoHyCTRc/50013 WHAT TIME IS IT ON MARS
trainval/HFqLoHyCTRc/50014 WAIT WHAT TIME IS IT IN CALIFORNIA
trainval/HFqLoHyCTRc/50015 WILL I WAKE THEM UP
trainval/HFqLoHyCTRc/50016 AND THEY WERE ON DAD'S WORK SCHEDULE
trainval/HFqLoHyCTRc/50017 SO THEY LIVED ON MARS TIME FOR A MONTH AND HAD THESE GREAT ADVENTURES LIKE GOING BOWLING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
trainval/HFqLoHyCTRc/50018 AND WHY ARE YOU AT MY RESTAURANT AT 3
trainval/HFqLoHyCTRc/50019 00 IN THE MORNING
trainval/HFqLoHyCTRc/50020 SO THOSE OF US WHO WERE ON MARS TIME WOULD REFER TO OURSELVES AS MARTIANS AND
trainval/HFqLoHyCTRc/50021 BUT WE DON'T STAY ON MARS TIME FOR MORE THAN THREE TO FOUR MONTHS
trainval/HFqLoHyCTRc/50022 EVENTUALLY WE'LL MOVE TO A MODIFIED MARS TIME WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE WORKING NOW
trainval/HFqLoHyCTRc/50024 AND THEY HAD ABOUT 30 OF US THAT THEY WOULD DO SLEEP DEPRIVATION EXPERIMENTS ON
trainval/HFqLoHyCTRc/50025 AND THAT WAS BECAUSE AGAIN THIS EVENTUALLY BECOMES HARD
trainval/HFqLoHyCTRc/50026 IT WAS A HUGE BONDING EXPERIENCE WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS ON THE TEAM BUT IT IS
trainval/HfuZJVpNWR4/50001 THIS IS SOMETHING FAMILIAR
trainval/HfuZJVpNWR4/50002 SO THINGS KIND OF GO OUT OF DATE
trainval/hfznpykprP0/50001 THESE WERE COMMUNITIES WHO'VE GROWN UP WITH STORIES OF THE MALI EMPIRE LIVED IN THE SHADOW OF
trainval/hfznpykprP0/50002 AND ALTHOUGH THEY WEREN'T ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL MANY OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MANUSCRIPTS WERE THANKFULLY
trainval/hfznpykprP0/50003 THEY KNEW THAT CONTROLLING TERRITORY AND SUBJUGATING THE HEAD OF STATE IT WASN'T ENOUGH
trainval/hfznpykprP0/50004 AND ONE WENT AS FAR AS TO POSIT I DO NOT THINK THAT I AM FAR WRONG IF I
trainval/hfznpykprP0/50005 WE'VE MAPPED AND WE'VE CHARTED AND WE'VE CAPTURED OUR HISTORIES IN WAYS THAT ARE THE
trainval/hfznpykprP0/50006 SUNDIATA KEITA WAS BORN ABOUT 1235 GROWING UP IN A TIME OF PROFOUND
trainval/hfznpykprP0/50008 AND AT ITS PEAK IN THE 15TH AND 16TH CENTURIES THE UNIVERSITY THERE WAS
trainval/hfznpykprP0/50009 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/HgRJNsTb08Q/50001 YOU ARE A REASON TO WAKE UP EVERY MORNING YOU ARE A REASON TO WAKE UP EVERY MORNING THAT'S WHY I OFFER YOU THIS
trainval/HgRJNsTb08Q/50002 FOR ALL OF THE TIMES I HAD TO LEARN HOW TO OFFER MYSELF BACK TO MYSELF
trainval/HgRJNsTb08Q/50003 YOU ALREADY CAN'T VOTE WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE ALLOWED TO LIVE HERE
trainval/HgRJNsTb08Q/50004 WE WANT OUR LANGUAGE BACK
trainval/hgui64Kr0Go/50001 MY FAVORITE ACCOUNT WAS FROM AN UNSCHOOLING MOM HER NAME IS JENNIFER
trainval/hgWie9dnssU/50001 SO WHAT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TODAY IS SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO AND THEN GIVE US SOME IDEAS OF HOW WE
trainval/hgWie9dnssU/50002 AND BY THEMSELVES THOSE PURCHASES DON'T SEEM LIKE THEY MIGHT REVEAL A LOT BUT IT'S A PATTERN OF
trainval/hgWie9dnssU/50003 WE CAN DO ALL OF THIS REALLY WELL
trainval/hgWie9dnssU/50004 SO IF YOU'RE SMART YOU TEND TO BE FRIENDS WITH SMART PEOPLE AND IF YOU'RE YOUNG YOU TEND TO BE FRIENDS WITH YOUNG PEOPLE AND THIS IS WELL
trainval/hgWie9dnssU/50005 IT TURNS OUT THINGS LIKE VIRAL VIDEOS OR FACEBOOK LIKES OR OTHER INFORMATION SPREADS IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY
trainval/hgWie9dnssU/50006 SO THIS IS SOMETHING WE'VE STUDIED FOR A LONG TIME
trainval/hgWie9dnssU/50007 THERE'S A LOT OF POWER THAT USERS DON'T HAVE TO CONTROL HOW THIS DATA IS USED
trainval/hgWie9dnssU/50008 AND I SEE THAT AS A REAL PROBLEM GOING FORWARD
trainval/hgWie9dnssU/50009 I COULD START THAT BUSINESS TOMORROW AND YOU WOULD HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO CONTROL OVER ME USING YOUR DATA LIKE THAT
trainval/hgWie9dnssU/50010 THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE A PROBLEM
trainval/hgWie9dnssU/50011 SO USERS CONTROL THEIR DATA
trainval/hgWie9dnssU/50012 IT'S POSSIBLE BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE CHANGE QUICKLY
trainval/hgWie9dnssU/50013 AND THAT I THINK CAN AFFECT WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE WANT TO SHARE SOMETHING KEEP IT PRIVATE OR JUST KEEP IT OFFLINE ALTOGETHER
trainval/Hh09xlzxRmE/50001 ALTHOUGH THE PROPORTION OF TRANSLATED BOOKS PUBLISHED IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES IS A LOT HIGHER
trainval/Hh09xlzxRmE/50002 SO FOR EXAMPLE ALTHOUGH WELL OVER 100 BOOKS ARE TRANSLATED FROM FRENCH AND PUBLISHED IN THE UK EACH
trainval/Hh09xlzxRmE/50003 I COULDN'T TELL YOU HOW TO SOURCE A STORY FROM SWAZILAND
trainval/Hh09xlzxRmE/50004 THEN IT WAS FRIENDS OF FRIENDS
trainval/Hh09xlzxRmE/50005 BUT MY BOOKSHELVES TOLD A RATHER DIFFERENT STORY
trainval/Hh09xlzxRmE/50006 MY PANAMANIAN READ FOR EXAMPLE CAME THROUGH A CONVERSATION I HAD WITH THE PANAMA CANAL ON TWITTER
trainval/Hh09xlzxRmE/50007 AND WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT IT IT SEEMED LIKE A REAL SHAME
trainval/Hh09xlzxRmE/50008 BUT IT CAN ALSO BE REALLY ENLIGHTENING
trainval/Hh09xlzxRmE/50009 I HOPE IT'S A STORY I'M READING FOR MANY YEARS TO COME
trainval/hh2Z2hSgFIY/50001 SO THE SAME TASK
trainval/hh2Z2hSgFIY/50002 THAT'S A BIT HARDER
trainval/hh2Z2hSgFIY/50003 CAPACITY TO STORE INFORMATION IS LIMITED
trainval/hh2Z2hSgFIY/50004 IF I WERE TO TEST YOU YOU WOULD REMEMBER ROUGHLY SEVEN ITEMS HERE
trainval/hh2Z2hSgFIY/50005 THIS HAS BEEN TERMED THE MAGIC NUMBER SEVEN
trainval/hh2Z2hSgFIY/50006 YOU HAVE PEOPLE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER RECEIVING THE TREATMENT WHICH IS THE WORKING
trainval/hh2Z2hSgFIY/50007 WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE TEST RESULTS WE COULD SEE THAT CHILDREN DOING THE TRAINING THEY HAVE
trainval/hh2Z2hSgFIY/50008 SO THE MAGIC NUMBER SEVEN ISN'T SO MAGIC AFTER ALL
trainval/hh2Z2hSgFIY/50009 THIS IS NICE
trainval/hh2Z2hSgFIY/50010 DOES IT MATTER
trainval/hh2Z2hSgFIY/50011 SO ONE WAY TO PUT THAT IS YOU NEED TO REMEMBER WHAT TO FOCUS ON
trainval/hh2Z2hSgFIY/50012 AND NOW WE HAVE MORE THAN 50 THOUSAND CHILDREN THAT HAVE
trainval/HH3m1OSiOT0/50002 MAYBE I CAN'T CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING INTO THE WORLD BECAUSE I GENUINELY LIKE AM NOT
trainval/HH3m1OSiOT0/50003 SO HOW EVERY SINGLE ATOM THAT MAKES UP YOU AND ME WAS FORMED IN THE BELLY OF A SUN
trainval/HH3m1OSiOT0/50004 I WAS DESPERATELY LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO GRAB ONTO
trainval/HH3m1OSiOT0/50005 BUT WHEN I DID COME OUT OF IT I REALIZED THAT KIND OF SUPPORT DOESN'T EXIST FOR OTHER PEOPLE WITH CF
trainval/HH3m1OSiOT0/50006 PEOPLE WITH CF CAN'T ACTUALLY BE IN THE SAME ROOM TOGETHER
trainval/HH3m1OSiOT0/50007 SO PARENTS OF CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS END UP HAVING TO TAKE OFF LONG PERIODS OF WORK TO BE ABLE TO
trainval/HH3m1OSiOT0/50008 SOMETHING THAT WOULD GENUINELY HELP THEM THROUGH THEIR EXPERIENCE
trainval/HH3m1OSiOT0/50009 I JUST EAT LITERALLY LIKE A VAT OF BROWN RICE AND POTATOES AND LIKE MORE BREAD ON
trainval/HH3m1OSiOT0/50010 LIFE ISN'T ABOUT JUST TRYING TO BE HAPPY
trainval/hHEVMhHDP1E/50001 WELL TO BE VULGAR ABOUT IT BEAUTY SELLS DOESN'T IT
trainval/hHEVMhHDP1E/50002 IF I'VE REALLY GOT YOU HOOKED PERHAPS YOU START SUPPORTING THE CAUSE THAT I WORK FOR
trainval/hHEVMhHDP1E/50003 A SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE LANDSCAPE AND AN ASIAN LANDSCAPE
trainval/hHEVMhHDP1E/50004 SO WITH THIS GREAT BURDEN OF RESPONSIBILITY IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE INGENIOUS GROWERS OF
trainval/hHEVMhHDP1E/50005 INDEED WE'VE WORKED OUT WAYS TO MAKE THE STUBBORN THE RELUCTANT THE HARD TO GROW STRAIGHT FORWARD
trainval/hHEVMhHDP1E/50006 TEA APPLES RICE AND GINGER
trainval/hHEVMhHDP1E/50007 IT HAS MORE SPECIES OF PLANTS THAN THE WHOLE OF EUROPE PUT TOGETHER
trainval/hHOX3dlhhZ0/50001 I DIDN'T EVEN THINK I COULD MAKE IT TO MY 18TH BIRTHDAY
trainval/hHOX3dlhhZ0/50002 WE PLACED HIGH VALUE ON IT
trainval/hi4QzyuSi6o/50001 AND THIS TIME HE FULLY KNEW WHY
trainval/hi4QzyuSi6o/50002 COM ARE FILLED WITH THESE KINDS OF INQUERIES
trainval/hi4QzyuSi6o/50003 THIS IS SOMETHING I LEARN FROM MANNY
trainval/hiM48jSNZOU/50001 HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF LINGUISTIC RELATIVITY
trainval/hiM48jSNZOU/50002 SO WHEN MY GERMAN FRIEND TAUGHT ME THIS WORD I THOUGHT
trainval/hiM48jSNZOU/50003 AND DID YOU KNOW THAT THE LANGUAGES THAT YOUR CHILD IS EXPOSED TO BEFORE THE AGE OF 7 WHICH IS ALSO
trainval/hiM48jSNZOU/50004 SO WHAT DO YOU THINK EVERYONE
trainval/hiM48jSNZOU/50005 SO ONE SUCH PROGRAM EXISTS IN JAFFA CALLED THE ORCHARD OF ABRAHAM'S CHILDREN
trainval/hiM48jSNZOU/50006 THIS IS BECAUSE YOUR MIND CATEGORIZES EVERYTHING WITH LANGUAGE LABELS SO THAT IT CAN REACH FOR YOUR MEMORIES AS
trainval/hiM48jSNZOU/50007 AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU SAY AND DO EVERY DECISION YOU MAKE EVERY CONVERSATION THAT YOU HAVE IS JUST A
trainval/HirySSCYiwI/50001 YOU'VE BEEN PREPARING YOURSELF FOR THIS MOMENT YOUR ENTIRE LIFE
trainval/HirySSCYiwI/50002 A BATTLE TO THE DEATH
trainval/HirySSCYiwI/50003 AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A ONE IN ONE MILLION CHANCE YOU WILL FIGHT
trainval/HirySSCYiwI/50004 ANGER CAN MOTIVATE YOU
trainval/HirySSCYiwI/50005 IN YOUR WILDEST DREAMS WHAT ARE ALL THE THINGS YOU WANT
trainval/HirySSCYiwI/50006 BUT IT'S GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH NOT HELPING ANYONE IS SO MUCH MONUMENTALLY GREATER THAN ANY
trainval/HirySSCYiwI/50007 SO MUCH SO THAT NOT MAKING A CONSCIOUS EFFORT TO HELP OTHERS AND MAKE THIS WORLD A BETTER PLACE IS MORALLY
trainval/HirySSCYiwI/50008 YOU'RE READY TO BE DONE WITH ENDLESS DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS CHEMOTHERAPY AND SURGERIES AND YOU SHOULD BE
trainval/hj7wkh6nONE/50001 TWO NEGATIVE WORDS
trainval/HjcKVB10Ucc/50001 WHAT ARE YOUR SKILLS
trainval/HjcKVB10Ucc/50002 WHERE ARE YOUR TALENTS
trainval/HjcKVB10Ucc/50003 WHAT HAVE YOU DONE IN THE PAST
trainval/HjcKVB10Ucc/50004 WHAT ARE YOU BRINGING ON BOARD
trainval/HjcKVB10Ucc/50006 AND ON THIS JOURNEY IT WAS ABOUT 40 HOURS ACTUALLY AND BELIEVE ME NOBODY HAD A
trainval/HjcKVB10Ucc/50007 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/HjnclEhy960/50001 IF YOU ADD THE TIME THEY SPEND WATCHING TV AND MOVIES READING MAGAZINES AND
trainval/HjnclEhy960/50002 BUT THE MEDIA OFTEN PORTRAITS THEM AS TIMELESS FACTS AND WHEN WE SPEND UP TO 10 HOURS A
trainval/HjnclEhy960/50003 MOST PRESS MAINSTREAM AND PRESS COVERAGE ALSO CONTINUE TO RELY ON MEN AS EXPERTS IN THE
trainval/HjnclEhy960/50004 THIS MEANS THAT NORWEGIAN GIRLS MAY BE FAR LESS FREE THAN WHAT WE MIGHT THINK THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY ARE GROWING UP
trainval/HjnclEhy960/50005 THIS IS LINKED TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE BOTH A VERY RICH AND A VERY LIBERAL COUNTRY
trainval/HjnclEhy960/50006 KIDS GET SMART PHONES AND LAPTOPS WHILE THEY ARE STILL IN PRIMARY SCHOOL AND THEY ALSO GET A LOT OF
trainval/HjnclEhy960/50007 AND BECAUSE WE HAVE TAKEN THIS FOR GRANTED WHILE AT THE SAME TIME GIVING KIDS ENORMOUS ACCESS TO
trainval/hJnEQCMA5Sg/50001 SO WHILE HE FILMED ME I KEPT FOLLOWING THE TRAIL OF RED PAINT WITH A SINGLE LIGHT AND A POINT AND SHOOT
trainval/hJnEQCMA5Sg/50002 THEY WERE THE ORIGINAL SHOULDERS
trainval/hJnEQCMA5Sg/50003 AND AFTER THE MOMENT OF TRANSMISSION IT'S GONE FOREVER
trainval/hJnEQCMA5Sg/50004 NOW IF THESE WERE RANDOM DOODLES OR DECORATIONS WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE A LOT MORE VARIATION BUT INSTEAD WHAT WE
trainval/hJnEQCMA5Sg/50005 BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THOSE EARLY WRITING SYSTEMS DIDN'T COME OUT OF A VACUUM
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50001 HALF AN HOUR LATER SHE WASN'T BACK
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50002 SO I DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50003 AND NEXT TO THEM WAS AN EMPTY MEN'S ROOM
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50004 BOTH MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER WHO HAD NO SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION TO HELP HER UNDERSTAND HER LIFE AND I WERE
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50005 WHAT WE ARE SAYING ABOUT KNOWLEDGE
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50006 AND FOR ONE YEAR STILL EVERYDAY I GET MESSAGES FROM WOMEN WHO SAY EVERYDAY IN MY
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50007 THEY ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50008 IS MY SON SMART
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50009 IS MY SON A GENIUS
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50010 IS MY DAUGHTER PRETTY
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50011 AND WHAT THEY RE SAYING TO GIRLS AND BOYS IS VERY DIFFERENT
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50012 BUT WE HAVE DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS AND THOSE BIASES AFFECT THE WAY PARENTS AND TEACHERS INTERACT WITH BOYS AND
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50014 THEY ARE SWIRLING IN CHAOS
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50015 THEIR HEADS ARE SWIRLING IN CHAOS
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50016 WHERE ARE THEY
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50017 YOU HAVE TO LAUGH RIGHT
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50018 EVERYBODY SAYS THAT FEMINISTS DON T HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50019 AND WE HAVE AN INTERESTING LISTENER BIAS
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50020 WE RE SUPPOSED TO BE QUIET
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50021 AND ALL OF THAT IS TIED TO WHETHER WE CAN BE KNOWERS
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50022 SO WHEN FEMINISTS SAY AS THEY HAVE BEEN FOR CENTURIES ARE WOMEN HUMAN
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50023 THIS IS WHAT WE RE TALKING ABOUT
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50025 IT MAY EVEN SAVE YOU MONEY
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50026 IT DOESN T ACQUIRE THAT YOU BUILD AN INSTITUTION AS WONDERFUL AS THE INSTITUTIONS ARE
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50027 AND SO THE FIRST THING I WOULD SAY IS
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50028 AND WHEN YOU TEACH MANNERS DON T HAVE THOSE MANNERS BE ABOUT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50029 SO THE DYNAMIC THAT I AM TALKING ABOUT IT MAY BE THAT IN YOUR OWN HOME THERE S A CHORE GAP
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50030 THAT HAS TO GO INTO SCHOOLS
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50031 WE NEED THEM TO BE SETTING EXAMPLES IN SCHOOLS
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50032 WE NEED THEM TO BE INTERACTING WITH BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS WHETHER IT IS A SEX SEGREGATED SCHOOL OR NOT
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50033 IT S MORE A MATTER OF HOW INTEGRATED THE TEACHING STAFF MAYBE
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50034 THAT SENDS A VERY STRONG MESSAGE TO CHILDREN
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50035 FATHERS SHOW UP
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50036 AND THEY DO THE OUTSIDE THINGS LIKE BUILD CABINS ON SPECIAL DAYS
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50037 AND THAT S IMPORTANT
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50038 SO THE LAST THING I WOULD TELL YOU IS I AM HERE TELLING HER STORY WHICH IS A HUGE CHANGE IN THE LAST 50
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50039 AND YOU HAVE THAT POWER TOO
trainval/HJqtUUDhaxA/50040 DON T BITE YOUR TONGUE
trainval/HjSGqwAFRcc/50001 SO CAN WE DO THAT
trainval/HJY8gMsonU0/50001 SO WE THOUGHT OK IF YOU CAN DO THIS REALLY FOR PEOPLE USING PROSTHETIC DEVICES AND WE CAN GET THEM INTO RUNNING IN
trainval/HJYDwS09coE/50001 UNTIL RECENTLY THERE WAS NO REASON TO THINK THAT THESE ANIMALS WERE IN ANY WAY THREATENED
trainval/HJYDwS09coE/50002 IN THAT RECIPIENT ANIMAL
trainval/HJYDwS09coE/50003 BECAUSE IN FACT THE MHCS ARE IDENTICAL
trainval/HJYDwS09coE/50004 THEY'RE NOT SEEN AS FOREIGN
trainval/hJZ0pAoxksE/50001 IF NOT I HAVE ANOTHER ILLUSTRATION FOR YOU
trainval/hJZ0pAoxksE/50002 PSYCHOLOGY BUT ALSO BEHAVIOURAL ECONOMICS AND SOME ASPECTS FROM
trainval/hJZ0pAoxksE/50003 YOU CHOOSE TO BECOME ONE
trainval/hJZ0pAoxksE/50004 WE TEND TO STICK TO A PREDETERMINED POSITION AND THAT MEANS THAT DEFAULT
trainval/hJZ0pAoxksE/50005 IT IS POTENTIALLY DISRUPTIVE FOR OUR OWN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR OWN BEING BUT ALSO FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF
trainval/hJZ0pAoxksE/50006 WHAT'S THE GOAL
trainval/hJZ0pAoxksE/50007 TO MAKE US CLICK
trainval/hJZ0pAoxksE/50008 THAT'S WHAT GENERATES REVENUE
trainval/hJZ0pAoxksE/50009 DEAR MISS FASTDRIVER WE WOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU TO PAY YOUR FINE FOR EXCESS SPEED
trainval/hJZ0pAoxksE/50010 MORE AND MORE COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD ARE GETTING VERY INTERESTED IN SUCH AN APPROACH
trainval/hJZ0pAoxksE/50011 THE APPEAL IS CLEAR
trainval/hJZ0pAoxksE/50012 MOST OF THESE APPLICATIONS ARE CHEAP
trainval/hJZ0pAoxksE/50013 IT DOESN'T COST MUCH TO IMPLEMENT THEM
trainval/hJZ0pAoxksE/50014 PROBABLY YOU ARE
trainval/hJZ0pAoxksE/50015 AND WHAT ABOUT ETHICAL ISSUES
trainval/hJZ0pAoxksE/50016 PERHAPS YOU DO
trainval/hJZ0pAoxksE/50017 WE ARE BECOMING AWARE OF THIS AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT NO NEUTRAL DESIGN
trainval/hJZ0pAoxksE/50018 THIS IS BECOMING EVEN MORE INTERESTING TODAY
trainval/hLltkCSG5dY/50001 IT SEEMS PREPOSTEROUS THAT YOU WOULD INVENT THE FLUTE A TOOL THAT CREATED USELESS VIBRATIONS IN AIR
trainval/hLltkCSG5dY/50002 SOMETIMES PEOPLE INVENT THINGS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO STAY ALIVE OR FEED THEIR CHILDREN OR CONQUER THE
trainval/hmFnzc3oZ04/50001 YOU CAN BE MORE
trainval/HmHh8dn6MiA/50001 WE STARTED A FOUNDATION THAT DOES EXACTLY THAT
trainval/HmHh8dn6MiA/50002 AND NOW 55 YEARS LATER THAT SAME FOUNDATION ASKED US TO
trainval/HmHh8dn6MiA/50003 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/HmHh8dn6MiA/50004 YOU CAN ONLY DO IT IN AMSTERDAM WHERE THE STORY ORIGINATED
trainval/HMYVHShBGWg/50001 AND THAT REALLY DESCRIBES INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
trainval/HMYVHShBGWg/50002 WHEN I WAS A STUDENT AT MIT WE ALL SHARED ONE COMPUTER THAT TOOK UP A WHOLE BUILDING
trainval/HMYVHShBGWg/50003 WE'LL SEE THE SAME THING IN THE ECONOMIC RECESSION WE'RE HAVING NOW
trainval/HMYVHShBGWg/50004 WHEN WE WALKED THROUGH THE SAVANNA A THOUSAND YEARS AGO WE MADE LINEAR PREDICTIONS WHERE THAT ANIMAL WOULD BE AND THAT WORKED FINE
trainval/HMYVHShBGWg/50005 AND I WAS ASKED WELL AREN'T YOU NERVOUS
trainval/HMYVHShBGWg/50006 IT'S HARDWIRED IN OUR BRAINS
trainval/HMYVHShBGWg/50007 AND THE PROJECT WAS FINISHED ON TIME
trainval/HMYVHShBGWg/50008 IT'S ALREADY VERY CLOSE TO US
trainval/HMYVHShBGWg/50009 WHAT NOW FITS IN OUR POCKETS WOULD FIT IN A BLOOD CELL IN 25 YEARS
trainval/HNMQSw7hXTA/50001 I THOUGHT THAT WAS NICE
trainval/HNMQSw7hXTA/50002 AND I USED TO NOT BE A GREAT FAN OF PUBLIC RESTROOMS BUT NOW I CAN GO ANYWHERE BECAUSE I
trainval/HNMQSw7hXTA/50003 BUT JUST KNOWING ABOUT THESE KINDS OF RESEARCH THAT'S OUT THERE AT THE MOMENT HELPS ME IN MY DAILY
trainval/HNMQSw7hXTA/50004 THEN I THINK STOP
trainval/HNMQSw7hXTA/50005 THIS IS SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING BAD AROUND
trainval/HNMQSw7hXTA/50006 AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT IT DOES MAKE SENSE BECAUSE OUR BRAIN IS VERY ISOLATED
trainval/HNOnvp5t7Do/50001 EMBASSY DIPLOMATIC CABLES
trainval/HNOnvp5t7Do/50002 AND THAT AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS MADE THE KENYAN PRESS FEEL SAFE TO TALK ABOUT IT
trainval/HNOnvp5t7Do/50003 INTELLIGENCE ANALYST BRADLEY MANNING ARRESTED AND IT'S ALLEGED THAT HE CONFESSED IN A CHAT ROOM TO
trainval/HNOnvp5t7Do/50005 IT SHOWS A U
trainval/HNOnvp5t7Do/50006 SOLDIER LAUGHING AT PEOPLE DYING
trainval/HNOnvp5t7Do/50007 THAT GIVES THE IMPRESSION HAS GIVEN THE IMPRESSION TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD THAT U
trainval/HNOnvp5t7Do/50008 SOLDIERS ARE INHUMAN PEOPLE
trainval/HNOnvp5t7Do/50010 MY SON ISN'T
trainval/HNOnvp5t7Do/50011 HOW DARE YOU
trainval/HNOnvp5t7Do/50012 I MEAN WE HAVE A HARM IMMUNIZATION POLICY
trainval/HNOnvp5t7Do/50013 THAT'S A PROBLEM
trainval/HNOnvp5t7Do/50014 YOU KNOW I WAS A VERY YOUNG JOURNALIST ACTIVIST AT AN EARLY AGE
trainval/HNOnvp5t7Do/50015 THAT MADE YOU VERY HIGH PROFILE IN ICELAND
trainval/HNOnvp5t7Do/50016 ICELAND'S A NORDIC COUNTRY SO LIKE NORWAY IT'S ABLE TO TAP INTO THE SYSTEM
trainval/HNOnvp5t7Do/50018 WHICH WAY IS IT GOING TO GO
trainval/HNOnvp5t7Do/50019 INSTEAD THEY PUBLICIZED YOUR SIDE
trainval/HonUUtuCSwM/50001 THIS HOSPITAL BASED SYSTEM USES ROBUST EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES TO HELP PATIENTS THAT MIGHT BE SERIOUSLY
trainval/HonUUtuCSwM/50002 BECAUSE THE ER HAS TO BE FULLY PREPARED WITH SPECIALISTS TRAINING MEDICATIONS AND EQUIPMENT FOR
trainval/HonUUtuCSwM/50003 AND THE COST FOR INDIVIDUALS IS HIGH AS WELL
trainval/HonUUtuCSwM/50004 AND THERE ARE CONSIDERATIONS BESIDES COST
trainval/HonUUtuCSwM/50005 HE PICKED UP A GI ILLNESS AND HAD PRETTY SIGNIFICANT VOMITING AND DIARRHEA
trainval/HonUUtuCSwM/50006 EVEN FOR A BIG CUT ON YOUR ARM
trainval/HonUUtuCSwM/50007 A SKILLED NURSE PRACTITIONER CAN REPLACE A FEEDING TUBE THAT CAME OUT OR STOPPED WORKING
trainval/HoyNrlMNBvw/50001 WOULD THE RACIAL PROBLEMS IN THE UNITED STATES BE WHAT THEY ARE
trainval/HoyNrlMNBvw/50002 WE'RE WITH YOU
trainval/HpAaSOgpi50/50001 I DID A ROUGH ESTIMATE OF HOW MANY DAYS I SPENT COMMUTING TO MY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN STOCKHOLM
trainval/HpAaSOgpi50/50002 IF WE KEEP DESIGNING AND BUILDING AS IF THE PLANET HAD UNLIMITED RESOURCES WE WILL
trainval/hPI0TM75lXA/50001 AND FOR THOSE OF US WHO DO UNDERSTAND OUR ACTIONS MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY REFLECT THAT UNDERSTANDING
trainval/hPI0TM75lXA/50002 HOWEVER THE IMPORTANCE OF MUSIC WITHIN THE BODY OF CULTURE IS UNDENIABLE
trainval/hPI0TM75lXA/50003 AND I DON'T KNOWS
trainval/hPI0TM75lXA/50004 ANYWAY I CAN RECALL REMEMBERING THINKING THAT THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HOW THIS WHOLE CUSTOM OF BLACK MEN DRESSING AND
trainval/HpiZTvlWx2g/50001 AND THE MAN'S NAME IS CARL NORDEN
trainval/HpiZTvlWx2g/50002 IT'S A REAL PLEASURE TO BE HERE
trainval/HpiZTvlWx2g/50003 AND I MEAN THAT IN ITS FULLEST SENSE OF THE WORD
trainval/HpiZTvlWx2g/50004 IT'S A COMPLICATED PHYSICS PROBLEM
trainval/HpiZTvlWx2g/50005 IT WEIGHS ABOUT 50 LBS
trainval/HpiZTvlWx2g/50006 AND THE BOMBSIGHT WILL TELL HIM WHEN TO DROP THE BOMB
trainval/HpiZTvlWx2g/50007 BUT HE SAID WITH THE MARK 15 NORDEN BOMBSIGHT HE COULD DROP A BOMB INTO A PICKLE BARREL AT
trainval/HpiZTvlWx2g/50008 I TALKED ABOUT SPAGHETTI SAUCE
trainval/HpiZTvlWx2g/50009 IT WAS LIKE MANNA FROM HEAVEN
trainval/HpiZTvlWx2g/50010 AND WHAT WAS GOD'S WILL
trainval/HpiZTvlWx2g/50011 AND WHAT DID THE NORDEN BOMBSIGHT DO
trainval/HpiZTvlWx2g/50012 WELL IT ALLOWED YOU TO DO THAT
trainval/HpiZTvlWx2g/50013 SECONDLY IT BREAKS DOWN A LOT
trainval/HpiZTvlWx2g/50014 THIRDLY WHEN NORDEN WAS MAKING HIS CALCULATIONS HE ASSUMED THAT A PLANE WOULD BE FLYING AT A RELATIVELY
trainval/HpiZTvlWx2g/50015 SO THEY STARTED FLYING THEM AT HIGH ALTITUDES AT INCREDIBLY HIGH SPEEDS
trainval/HpiZTvlWx2g/50016 THEY'VE INVENTED WEBSITES THAT WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO BE FREE
trainval/HpiZTvlWx2g/50017 THE MISSION OF THE TWO SQUADRONS WAS TO GET RID OF ALL THE SCUD MISSILE LAUNCHERS
trainval/HpiZTvlWx2g/50018 AND AFTER THE WAR WAS OVER THERE WAS AN AUDIT DONE AS THE ARMY ALWAYS DOES THE AIR FORCE ALWAYS DOES AND THEY ASKED THE QUESTION HOW
trainval/HpiZTvlWx2g/50019 IS IT BECAUSE THEIR WEAPONS WEREN'T ACCURATE
trainval/HpiZTvlWx2g/50020 THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE HARDER PROBLEM WHEN IT COMES TO FIGHTING WARS
trainval/HpiZTvlWx2g/50021 NOW WHAT IS THE ACCURACY OF THOSE DRONES
trainval/HpiZTvlWx2g/50022 WELL IT'S EXTRAORDINARY
trainval/HpiZTvlWx2g/50023 WE THINK WE'RE NOW AT 95 PERCENT ACCURACY WHEN IT COMES TO DRONE STRIKES
trainval/HpiZTvlWx2g/50024 THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY RECORDS IN THE HISTORY OF MODERN WARFARE
trainval/HpiZTvlWx2g/50025 AND THIS IS THE PROBLEM WITH OUR INFATUATION WITH THE THINGS WE MAKE
trainval/HpiZTvlWx2g/50026 AND THAT IS ON AUGUST 6 1945 A B 29 BOMBER
trainval/HpiZTvlWx2g/50027 WELL HOW MANY CLOUDLESS SKIES DO YOU THINK THERE WERE ABOVE CENTRAL EUROPE BETWEEN 1940 AND
trainval/hPsUXhXgWmI/50001 RAISE YOUR HAND AND WE'LL TRY TO GET YOU A MICROPHONE
trainval/hPsUXhXgWmI/50002 IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE HE REJECTED THE ARISTOTELIAN PREMISE
trainval/hPVLbEapUD0/50001 FINDING OF FACT ONE
trainval/hPVLbEapUD0/50002 MY CLIENT IS HUMAN
trainval/hQ4XmSR9zw8/50001 EVERYTHING THAT I WAS LIVING IN EVERYTHING THAT SURROUNDED ME WAS BASED ON A REGULAR
trainval/hQ4XmSR9zw8/50002 AND THEN I REALIZED I DON'T WANT TO DO THE 9 TO 5 JOB THING ANYMORE
trainval/hQ4XmSR9zw8/50003 I JUST WANT TO GET RID OF ALL THIS SYSTEM WE HAVE WHICH SURROUNDED US
trainval/hQ4XmSR9zw8/50004 WE'VE GOT AN INSURANCE FOR OUR CAR OF COURSE WE'VE GOT AN INSURANCE FOR OUR HEALTH SYSTEM THEN WE'VE GOT AN
trainval/hQ4XmSR9zw8/50005 I WANT TO HAVE MY MONEY BACK
trainval/hQ4XmSR9zw8/50006 I THOUGHT IT SOUNDS GOOD
trainval/hQ4XmSR9zw8/50007 I'LL TRY THAT
trainval/hQ4XmSR9zw8/50008 I'LL DO THE REALITY CHECK THERE
trainval/hQ4XmSR9zw8/50009 NUMBER ONE IS DO YOUR HOMEWORK
trainval/hQ4XmSR9zw8/50010 SO IF YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO COME UP AND SAY I DIDN'T HAVE TIME IT'S A SUNNY DAY
trainval/hQ4XmSR9zw8/50011 NO NO NO NO
trainval/hQ4XmSR9zw8/50012 OH ON FRIDAYS I NORMALLY DON'T WORK I ALWAYS PARTY THEN THE UGLY TRUTH IS IT'S
trainval/hQ4XmSR9zw8/50013 BECAUSE WHY NOT
trainval/hQ4XmSR9zw8/50014 IT WILL SLOW YOU DOWN AND AT THE END OF THE DAY IT WILL BLOCK YOU IN ANYTHING YOU'LL DO BECAUSE YOU'LL BE FULL OF
trainval/hQ4XmSR9zw8/50015 BUT WHY NOT
trainval/hQ4XmSR9zw8/50016 AND I CAN TELL YOU ONE THING
trainval/hQ4XmSR9zw8/50017 SHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE
trainval/hQ4XmSR9zw8/50018 IF YOU WANT TO SEE SOMETHING GROW NEVER KEEP WHAT YOU KNOW
trainval/hQ4XmSR9zw8/50019 I SHARED ALL THE INFORMATION I HAD
trainval/hQ4XmSR9zw8/50020 I WENT THERE OK IT WAS MY DUTY AS WELL BUT I SHARED ALL THE INFORMATION I HAD ABOUT PR
trainval/hQ4XmSR9zw8/50021 AND HE SAID WELL BECAUSE WE'RE BANKRUPT
trainval/hQ4XmSR9zw8/50022 PASSION WILL PUSH YOU MUCH FURTHER WHERE OTHERS HAVE ALREADY LOST THEIR INTEREST LONG AGO AND STOPPED WORKING
trainval/HqawqHB7nDM/50001 SOMETIMES THEY GIVE US SOMETHING AND SOMETIMES THEY DON'T
trainval/HqawqHB7nDM/50002 ABOUT 15 YEARS AGO I WAS WRITING A BOOK CALLED CHANGE ACTIVIST
trainval/HqawqHB7nDM/50003 HAS THIS MADE ANY DIFFERENCE AT ALL
trainval/HqawqHB7nDM/50004 FIRST OF ALL THE TESCO PEOPLE THOUGHT I HAD THE BIGGEST CARB HABIT IN THE WORLD
trainval/HqawqHB7nDM/50006 WHAT'S THE SMALLEST THING WE CAN DO TO MAKE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE
trainval/HqawqHB7nDM/50007 WE ALSO WANT TO TACKLE HOLIDAY HUNGER
trainval/HqawqHB7nDM/50008 WE'VE GOT MAGIC BREAKFAST 365
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50001 THE HAWAIIANS WERE GARDENERS BECAUSE WHEN THEY SET OUT TO DISCOVER THE ISLANDS OF HAWAII THEY TOOK WITH THEM IN THEIR CANOES
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50002 THE HAWAIIANS WERE GARDENERS BECAUSE RATHER THAN JUST ARBITRARILY PUTTING UP PADDOCKS ON THE ISLAND THEY UNDERSTOOD THE
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50003 HOWEVER WHEN THEY RETURNED THE WATER THAT THEY USED FOR IRRIGATION TO THE RIVER IT WAS FULL OF SILT AND VERY HIGH IN NUTRIENTS
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50004 BUT A SEED OF DOUBT CROSSED MY MIND IT WAS ALL WELL AND GOOD IF THIS WOULD WORK IN THE TROPICS BUT I WAS PLANNING TO
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50005 ONE OF THE BIG MYTHS OF CIVILIZATION IS THAT PEOPLE WERE HUNTER GATHERS ONE DAY DISCOVERED AGRICULTURE AND WE NEVER LOOKED
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50006 THE REALITY IS THERE IS A THIRD WAY WHICH WAS PRACTICED BY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD AND MORE RESEMBLES
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50007 THE BEST STUDIED EXAMPLES INCLUDE THE OAK WOODLANDS OF CALIFORNIA THE ARAUCANIAN FORESTS OF CHILE
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50008 ALL OF THESE CULTURES WOULD CULTIVATE THE WHOLE LANDSCAPE THEY WERE ABLE TO HARVEST FROM TREE CROPS AND BECAUSE THE
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50009 LUCKY FOR US THE THEORY STACKS UP
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50010 BECAUSE PERENNIAL PLANTS GROW FOR MORE THAN ONE YEAR THEY TEND TO DEVELOP EXTENSIVE ROOT SYSTEMS WHICH REACH DEEP DOWN INTO THE
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50011 NOW IF WE WENT OUT AND RANDOMLY SELECTED SOME PLANTS AND STARTED GROWING THEM IN THE SAME SPACE IT'S LIKELY THAT WE'D
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50012 IF WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE THE FOOD WE NEED IN THE FUTURE WE NEED TO DO SO IN A WAY THAT SUPPORTS AND
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50013 HOWEVER THE SOLUTIONS ON OFFER WERE MORE OF THE SAME AND SHOWED ME A FUTURE WHERE EVERY FOREST WAS TURNED INTO A FIELD
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50014 THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF FOREST GARDEN PRINCIPLES AND A LITTLE BIT OF THOUGHTFUL DESIGN A POPULATION OF POLLINATORS COULD BE
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50015 EVEN IF OUR MAIN CROPS ARE NOT COMING FROM THE FOREST GARDENS THEMSELVES THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES THAT A FOREST
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50016 YOU SEE ANOTHER TREND ABOUT OUR FOOD PRODUCTION WAS POINTED OUT TO ME
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50017 IF WE ARE GOING TO PRODUCE THE FOOD THAT WE NEED IN THE FUTURE WE NEED TO BRING FOOD PRODUCTION INTO OUR CITIES SO THAT CITIES ARE
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50018 CANBERRA HAS THIS POTENTIAL GIVEN ITS HISTORY AS A GARDEN CITY
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50019 PEST CONTROL WOULD BE UNDERTAKEN THROUGH THE USE OF INSECTICIDES BUT THESE ARE KNOWN TO KILL OFF THE POLLINATORS THAT THE PEACH
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50020 AS A RESULT CANBERRA HAS AN ABUNDANCE OF GREEN SPACE IN OUR URBAN AREAS A MUCH HIGHER PROPORTION THAN MANY
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50021 WE TEND TO THINK THAT THESE GREEN SPACES ARE ECOLOGICALLY INTACT BUT MANY OF OURS IN CANBERRA ARE ECOLOGICAL
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50022 IN A FOREST GARDEN WE ARE TRYING TO USE OUR LAYERS AND THESE CONNECTIONS TO CREATE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN THE
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50023 THEY SLOW DOWN AND CLEAN UP THE WATER THAT GOES DOWN OUR DRAINS BEFORE IT GETS TO THE LAKE
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50024 THIS IS KIND OF LIKE COMPANION PLANTING BUT ON A MUCH BIGGER SCALE
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50025 IT IS TIME FOR CANBERRA TO MOVE BEYOND ITS INITIAL VISION AS A GARDEN CITY AND SEE ITSELF AS A WORLD LEADING
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50026 IF I'VE INSPIRED YOU TODAY YOU CAN GO HOME AND START FOREST GARDENING
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50027 IT'S MUCH EASIER FOR THIS PEACH TREE TO GET THE NUTRIENTS FOR THE NEEDS THAT IT HAS AND IT CAN PRODUCE MANY MORE PEACHES AS A
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50028 THESE IDEAS GO BEYOND OUR BACKYARD AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW FOREST GARDENING COULD APPLY TO MODERN AGRICULTURE
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50029 THERE IS ONE VALLEY IN CALIFORNIA WHICH PRODUCES 30 OF THE WORLD'S ALMOND CROP SO AS YOU CAN IMAGINE
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50030 PERENNIAL AGRICULTURE DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT A MODEL ECOSYSTEM DOESN'T WORK OUT OF THE BOX
trainval/HQIi3nUXh0g/50031 IF WE START CULTIVATING THEM IN CANBERRA TODAY THEY WILL BE ONLINE FOR US TOMORROW AND WE WILL SEE
trainval/HQNfpElOiZY/50001 I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I SPEND QUALITY TIME WITH THEM
trainval/hqQSTqVNnOY/50001 I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER WHAT IMPACT ALL THOSE LITTLE BITS OF PLASTIC HAVE ON THE WHALES HARKS THAT I STUDY
trainval/hqQSTqVNnOY/50003 THEY MAKE A LIVING BY SEPARATING PLANKTON FROM HUGE VOLUMES OF WATER AND I'M ALL BUT CERTAIN THAT THEY INGEST THIS
trainval/hqQSTqVNnOY/50004 CHRONIC PROBLEMS LIKE PLASTIC POLLUTION ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE THINGS THE OCEAN DOES FOR US
trainval/hqQSTqVNnOY/50005 IN ORDER TO NAVIGATE THE CHALLENGES OF THE COMING CENTURY
trainval/hqQSTqVNnOY/50006 I'D LIKE YOU TO HOLD IN YOUR MIND IF YOU WOULD FOR JUST A MOMENT A MENTAL IMAGE OF AN AVERAGE BIT OF THE OCEAN AND WHAT
trainval/hqQSTqVNnOY/50007 HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE
trainval/hqQSTqVNnOY/50008 BUT IT DOESN'T STOP THERE
trainval/hqQSTqVNnOY/50009 AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DEEPEST PART OF THE OCEAN THAT IS THE MARIANA'S TRENCH OFF THE COAST OF GUAM THE PRESSURE IS MORE THAN
trainval/hqQSTqVNnOY/50010 ONCE IN 1961 AND ONCE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
trainval/hqQSTqVNnOY/50011 WE SHOULDN'T SHY AWAY FROM THE CHALLENGES OF WORKING IN THE DEEP OCEAN
trainval/hqQSTqVNnOY/50012 THERE ARE FANTASTIC CHANCES WAITING OUT THERE FOR US TO EXPLORE AND DISCOVER INVENT THINGS SOLVE
trainval/hqQSTqVNnOY/50013 IT'S REALLY JUST A MATTER OF IMPLEMENTATION
trainval/hqQSTqVNnOY/50014 ACTIVATION ENERGY IF YOU LIKE
trainval/hqQSTqVNnOY/50015 BRING A CLOTH BAG TO THE SUPERMARKET
trainval/hqQSTqVNnOY/50016 SAY NO TO THE STRAW
trainval/hqQSTqVNnOY/50017 WE WILL FIND WAYS TO FEED A GROWING POPULATION THROUGH FISHERIES MANAGEMENTS AND CREATIVE AQUACULTURE
trainval/hqQSTqVNnOY/50018 BUT THE OCEAN IS ALSO A CHALLENGING PLACE TO WORK
trainval/hqQSTqVNnOY/50019 BUT WE HAVE TO GET CRACKING
trainval/HR9956gDpUY/50001 AND AS A RESULT STYROFOAM IS CONSIDERED A NONRENEWABLE MATERIAL BECAUSE IT IS NEITHER FEASIBLE NOR VIABLE
trainval/HR9956gDpUY/50002 MY TEAM HYPOTHESIZED THAT WE COULD USE THE CARBON THAT'S ALREADY IN STYROFOAM TO CREATE ACTIVATED
trainval/HR9956gDpUY/50003 SO WHY DID WE KEEP TRYING WHEN ALL THE ADULTS SAID IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
trainval/HR9956gDpUY/50004 WITH THE RIGHT TEMPERATURES TIMES AND CHEMICALS WE FINALLY GOT THAT SUCCESSFUL TEST RESULT SHOWING US THAT WE HAD
trainval/HR9956gDpUY/50005 WE TOOK A PROBLEM THAT MANY PEOPLE SAID WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND WE MADE IT POSSIBLE AND WE PERSEVERED WHEN IT LOOKED LIKE
trainval/hrpwRdijvCM/50001 SOME OF US ARE DOING VERY WELL
trainval/hRSw8DBbFr8/50001 I THOUGHT I WAS THE UGLY DIFFERENT ONE AMONG MY CHILDHOOD FRIENDS IN
trainval/hRSw8DBbFr8/50002 I WANT YOU TO REPEAT THESE WORDS
trainval/hRSw8DBbFr8/50003 WHY AM I HERE
trainval/hRSw8DBbFr8/50004 AND SO NOW WHAT I WANT TO DO IS I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU ALL TO REALLY TRY STARTING
trainval/hS3dLASh3Yc/50001 I WAS SERIOUS ABOUT MY FAITH HOPING TO ONE DAY DISCOVER A TONIC OF SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINES THAT
trainval/hS3dLASh3Yc/50002 THE CONVERSATIONS WERE TOUGH AT FIRST
trainval/HS8y0WLm78U/50001 UNLIKE ME THOUGH YOUR BOSS PROBABLY WASN'T THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
trainval/HS8y0WLm78U/50002 A THIRD PARTY APP WHICH SNAPCHATTERS USE TO PRESERVE THE LIFESPAN OF THE MESSAGES WAS
trainval/HS8y0WLm78U/50003 WE'VE SEEN THAT TO BE TRUE WITH RACISM HOMOPHOBIA AND PLENTY OF OTHER BIASES TODAY AND IN THE
trainval/HS8y0WLm78U/50004 IN THE PAST NINE MONTHS THE QUESTION I'VE BEEN ASKED THE MOST IS WHY
trainval/HS8y0WLm78U/50005 WHY WAS I STICKING MY HEAD ABOVE THE PARAPET
trainval/hscdmpKGqrQ/50001 MOST OF US ARE QUITE ANNOYING AT LEAST TO EACH OTHER
trainval/hscdmpKGqrQ/50002 I'M NOT BUT YOU ARE
trainval/hscdmpKGqrQ/50003 WHY IS IT THAT WE ARE SO ANNOYING TO EACH OTHER
trainval/hscdmpKGqrQ/50004 THE IN GROUP OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE ME AND THE OUT GROUP FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT LIKE ME
trainval/hscdmpKGqrQ/50005 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY RELIGION
trainval/hscdmpKGqrQ/50006 I HAVE ASKED MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THIS QUESTION OVER THE YEARS AND TYPICALLY WE GET VERY SIMILAR LISTS OF
trainval/hscdmpKGqrQ/50007 BUT THE WORD LOVE IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IS FAIRLY SLOPPY YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THIS WE SAY I LOVE MY
trainval/hscdmpKGqrQ/50008 YOU MIGHT FIND THAT OTHER PEOPLE MAKE YOU REALLY HOSTILE OR ANGRY
trainval/hscdmpKGqrQ/50009 SO THE MOVE IS FROM ANTIPATHY TO APATHY
trainval/hscdmpKGqrQ/50010 BUT IT'S A BIG STEP FORWARD FROM APATHY SO THIS IS GOOD
trainval/hscdmpKGqrQ/50011 THIS IS ALSO TREMENDOUSLY DIFFICULT BECAUSE WHEN YOU START FEELING ALL THE SUFFERING ON THIS PLANET YOU CAN FEEL
trainval/hscdmpKGqrQ/50012 THERE ARE DOZENS OF OTHER SYNONYMS THAT YOU COULD PICK FROM
trainval/hscdmpKGqrQ/50013 THE IDEA IS YOU FIND THE SYNONYM THAT WORKS FOR YOU BUT COLLECTIVELY WE BRIDGE BY USING THIS
trainval/HSDr2Jap44w/50001 MAYBE YOU'VE GOT AN INTERNSHIP
trainval/HSmKRshF1SA/50001 ONE IS LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE AND THE OTHER ONE IS LIFE WITH
trainval/HSmKRshF1SA/50002 SOMEBODY STOLE MY PHONE
trainval/HSmKRshF1SA/50003 THERE ARE MEN WHO I HAVE LEARNED FROM THERE ARE MEN I CONTINUE TO LEARN FROM AND
trainval/HSpqhMO3ZSY/50001 THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT ORGANIZATIONS CAN GATHER ABOUT YOU AND HOW THEY CAN USE IT TO INFLUENCE YOU IN A WAY THAT YOU WILL NOT
trainval/HSpqhMO3ZSY/50002 AND IN PRINCIPLE THAT'S A VERY GOOD THING
trainval/hSSmmlridUM/50001 I WAS TROUBLED
trainval/hSSmmlridUM/50002 IT'S ETHICS ALL THE WAY DOWN
trainval/hSSmmlridUM/50003 ARE AIRPLANES SAFER
trainval/hSSmmlridUM/50005 THEY WERE SUPER EXCITED
trainval/hSSmmlridUM/50006 THEY THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD MAKE HIRING MORE OBJECTIVE LESS BIASED AND GIVE WOMEN AND
trainval/hSSmmlridUM/50007 I ALWAYS WENT
trainval/hSSmmlridUM/50008 REMEMBER FOR THINGS YOU HAVEN'T EVEN DISCLOSED
trainval/hSSmmlridUM/50009 AND SHE TURNED AROUND AND WALKED AWAY
trainval/hSSmmlridUM/50010 IT'S A COMMERCIAL BLACK BOX
trainval/hSSmmlridUM/50011 THERE'S NO RIGHT ANSWER
trainval/hSSmmlridUM/50012 WAS IT MY FACEBOOK FRIENDS
trainval/hSSmmlridUM/50013 I RESEARCHED THIS AND FOUND THIS WAS A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM
trainval/hSSmmlridUM/50014 THEY MAKE MISTAKES BUT THAT'S EXACTLY MY POINT
trainval/HsSvPqfsO0Q/50001 BUT I'M STILL THINKING PROBABLY A TRAPPED NERVE OR A CARPAL TUNNEL AT WORST
trainval/HsSvPqfsO0Q/50003 YOU'RE FIGHTING A BATTLE AGAINST YOUR BRAIN AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WIN
trainval/HsSvPqfsO0Q/50004 I'VE LOOKED FOR IT IN THE FORM OF MEN ON WHITE HORSES CARRYING ARMOUR AND THINGS LIKE THAT
trainval/HsSvPqfsO0Q/50006 THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU WILL BE HAPPIER AS WELL
trainval/HsSvPqfsO0Q/50007 BE IMPATIENT WITH YOURSELF AND DON'T SETTLE
trainval/HsSvPqfsO0Q/50009 EVERYONE'S RUSHING TO GET SOMEWHERE AND DO SOMETHING AND PUSHING OTHER PEOPLE OUT OF THE WAY
trainval/hsSYuHv0vUk/50001 SO IN THE LAB I'VE BEEN CREATING ART AS A WAY TO HELP ME DESIGN BETTER EXPERIENCES FOR BLEEDING EDGE
trainval/hsSYuHv0vUk/50002 I'VE BEEN COLLABORATING WITH A CONVERSATION ANALYST AT THE LAB TO TRY TO HELP OUR AI SYSTEMS HOLD MORE HUMAN
trainval/hsSYuHv0vUk/50003 AND WE CALL THIS THE UNCANNY VALLEY
trainval/hsSYuHv0vUk/50004 AND THE PIECE WILL START BEING ONE WAY THAT WE TEST FOR THE HUMANNESS OF A CONVERSATION AND THE PARTS THAT GET LOST IN
trainval/hsSYuHv0vUk/50005 LIKE HUMAN INTUITION
trainval/hsSYuHv0vUk/50006 AND I CREATED A PIECE THAT EXPLORES COMPUTER BASED INTUITION IN A PHYSICAL SPACE
trainval/hsSYuHv0vUk/50007 SO WHEN YOU WALK IN FRONT OF IT IT STARTS TO USE ALL OF THE DATA THAT IT'S CAPTURED THROUGHOUT ITS EXHIBITION HISTORY
trainval/HSZ1ZvjlKDE/50001 YOU MIGHT HAVE A 16 A 20 A 24 YOU MIGHT HAVE A 12
trainval/HSZ1ZvjlKDE/50002 SO THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE DID
trainval/HSZ1ZvjlKDE/50003 THIS IS PAIGE'S WHAT MATTERS TO YOU
trainval/HSZ1ZvjlKDE/50005 THAT'S A VERY COMPLEX THING TO DEAL WITH IN A HOSPITAL WARD
trainval/HSZ1ZvjlKDE/50006 AND PEOPLE WOULD STOP AND SIT BESIDE ROSE
trainval/HSZ1ZvjlKDE/50007 WELL THE END OF THE STORY IS THAT DON ENTERED SCOTLAND'S FIVE INCH
trainval/HSZ1ZvjlKDE/50008 THAT'S THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WHAT MATTERS TO YOU CONVERSATION
trainval/HSzqFSOft20/50001 THE DAHLIAS AND THE ASTERS TOWERED ABOVE ME
trainval/HSzqFSOft20/50002 I FELT THE TRANQUILITY AND PEACE
trainval/HSzqFSOft20/50003 I ALSO FELT THE SPIRIT OF THE PLACE
trainval/HSzqFSOft20/50004 I FELT MONET'S SPIRIT
trainval/HSzqFSOft20/50005 YOU'VE GOT TO WORK IT
trainval/HSzqFSOft20/50006 MY FRIEND SAID WELL WHY DON'T YOU SPEND THE NIGHT AND YOU CAN COME BACK TOMORROW
trainval/HSzqFSOft20/50007 I WAS VISUALIZING MY NEW BLOOM AS WELL
trainval/HSzqFSOft20/50008 IT CAN BE A RADICAL ACT
trainval/HSzqFSOft20/50009 THE BEAUTY CALLED HIM BACK
trainval/ht1zFl7HyO8/50001 AND PROJECT TANGO IS A PROJECT BY GOOGLE
trainval/Ht6TTA8z3MI/50001 AND ACTUALLY FROM THAT DAY ON SHE'S BEEN COMFORTABLE WITH US
trainval/hTAXEq6zLo8/50001 THIS STATISTIC NOT ONLY SUGGEST THAT MEN ARE EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS
trainval/hTAXEq6zLo8/50002 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE MEN OF MEN TALK WHERE THE AVERAGE AGE IS MID 40S HAVE SAID IS HOW CAN WE
trainval/hTAXEq6zLo8/50003 I WENT TO A UNIVERSITY ON THE WEST COAST OF THE US CALLED WALLA WALLA UNIVERSITY IT'S A SISTER COLLEGE OF MY
trainval/HTf7Ziklcms/50001 TWO THIEVES BROKE INTO THE MUSEUM OF SCIENCE OF COIMBRA IN PORTUGAL
trainval/HTf7Ziklcms/50002 24 YEARS AGO I UNDERWENT A WATERSHED MOMENT IN MY LIFE WHEN I SURVIVED THE ATTACK BY A
trainval/HTf7Ziklcms/50003 WHAT IS MY ROLE
trainval/HTf7Ziklcms/50004 NOW YES I KNOW
trainval/Hul8htHa9AY/50001 NOW YOU CAN SAY THAT WHAT YOU ARE EATING IS NOT ONLY SWEET BUT A SWEET PEACH FLAVORED JELLY
trainval/Hul8htHa9AY/50002 BUT IF WE DO NOT WANT TO SMELL WE CANNOT CLOSE OUR NOSES BECAUSE IF WE CLOSE OUR NOSES WE CANNOT BREATHE
trainval/Hul8htHa9AY/50003 IT DEPENDS ON A GROUP OF GENES THAT REGULATE YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM
trainval/hupHAPF1fHY/50001 AND YOU CAN DO THAT YOU CAN TWEAK THE VIRUSES SO THEY HIT JUST SOME CELLS AND NOT OTHERS
trainval/hupHAPF1fHY/50002 AND BY TURNING THINGS OFF IT'S MORE OR LESS A ZERO
trainval/HuWMO3M1HVQ/50001 I WENT TO MY FIRST COMMUNITY BOARD MEETING WHICH I'D NEVER BEEN TO ONE BEFORE AND SAT NEXT TO ANOTHER GUY
trainval/HuWMO3M1HVQ/50002 AND THE GOAL AT FIRST WAS JUST SAVING IT FROM DEMOLITION BUT THEN WE ALSO WANTED TO FIGURE OUT
trainval/HuWMO3M1HVQ/50003 BUT YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING ON THE HIGH LINE AND I THINK THAT'S THE POWER THAT PUBLIC SPACE CAN HAVE TO
trainval/HV4loecFZh8/50001 THEIR CALM DOWN SYSTEM IN THEIR BRAIN DOESN'T BEGIN TO COME ON LINE UNTIL
trainval/HV4loecFZh8/50002 TALKING WITH HIM IS THE SECOND KEY POINT
trainval/hvJ4KlVlqV8/50001 THAT'S WHY I HAVE DECIDED TO HAVE NO CONTRACTS WITH MY CURRENT TEAM MEMBERS
trainval/hvJ4KlVlqV8/50002 I'M QUITE SURE SOMEWHERE IN THERE IT ALSO HAD PEOPLE'S KEYSTROKES PER MINUTE AND TOILET
trainval/hvJ4KlVlqV8/50003 THOSE ARE THE SEVEN SILVER BULLETS THAT I FOUND
trainval/hVShA7g4Joc/50001 YOU MIGHT ALL SAY OBVIOUS THEY'RE DIFFERENT
trainval/hVShA7g4Joc/50002 I KNOW DEEP DOWN IN YOUR HEART YOU KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50001 I DON'T HAVE ANY SLIDES
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50002 THIS IS WHERE IT'S REALLY CENTRAL TO OUR LIVES
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50003 NOW I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A WHOLE LOT OF HYPE ABOUT OUR POWER TO CONTROL BIOLOGY
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50004 YOU JUST HAVE TO LOOK AT THE HUMAN GENOME PROJECT
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50005 WE'RE DECIPHERING THE CODE OF CODES
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50006 WE'RE READING THE BOOK OF LIFE
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50007 IT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY WE HAVE CHILDREN
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50008 IT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY WE MANAGE AND ALTER OUR EMOTIONS
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50009 IT'S GOING TO PROBABLY CHANGE THE HUMAN LIFESPAN
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50010 THE FIRST OF THEM IS THE OBVIOUS ONE THE SILICON REVOLUTION WHICH YOU ALL ARE VERY VERY FAMILIAR WITH
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50011 BUT WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR ALL THIS
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50012 AND IT'S GOING TO BE USED FOR DIET AS WELL AND NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS AND SUCH
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50013 AND WE AREN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE KINDS OF EXPENSES THAT WE HAVE TO CREATE BLOCKBUSTER
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50014 ANOTHER THING IS THAT WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50015 9 PERCENT OF THE LETTERS IN THE CODE ARE THE SAME
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50016 THERE ARE THREE OBVIOUS WAYS OF DOING THIS
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50017 AND WHEN IT DOES IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THAT BIG A DEAL
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50018 OF COURSE THERE IS GOING TO BE GENETIC ENGINEERING
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50019 DIRECTLY GOING IN IT'S A LITTLE BIT FURTHER AWAY BUT NOT THAT FAR AWAY GOING IN AND ALTERING THE
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50020 AND IT WON'T BE DONE
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50021 BUT WHEN SOMETHING IS FEASIBLE IN THOUSANDS OF LABORATORIES ALL OVER THE WORLD WHICH IS GOING TO BE THE CASE WITH THESE TECHNOLOGIES WHEN
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50022 HUMANITY IS GOING TO GO DOWN THIS PATH
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50023 THAT'S WHAT WE DO
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50024 TO IMAGINE THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO USE THESE TECHNOLOGIES WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE IS AS MUCH A DENIAL
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50025 PEOPLE CAN TRY AND BAN THESE THINGS
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50026 THEY UNDOUBTEDLY WILL
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50027 AND THAT'S WHERE ABOUT HALF OF OUR DRUGS COME
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50028 AND IF YOU DON'T WHO ARE YOU GOING TO BE
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50029 AND THAT IS WHY THEY ARE SO VERY TROUBLING TO SO MANY PEOPLE WHO WOULD PULL BACK IN
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50030 IT'S GOING TO PICK UP SPEED
trainval/hVsnkRoYfX0/50031 THAT'S THE WAY THESE THINGS WORK
trainval/hvStFIuhD8E/50001 THAT'S INCREDIBLY POWERFUL TECHNOLOGY
trainval/hvStFIuhD8E/50002 ASTRONAUT BILL ANDERS FRANTICALLY ASKS HIS CREWMATES WHERE THEIR CAMERA IS GRABS THE HASSELBLAD POINTS IT TOWARDS THE
trainval/hWnZKAXSv3s/50001 SHE TELLS HER FRIENDS AND FAMILY
trainval/HWsehvUkISc/50001 NO EXPENSIVE STAFF TIME REQUIRED
trainval/HWsehvUkISc/50003 AND LIKE BALLET IT TAKES AN EXTRAORDINARY LEVEL OF TRAINING
trainval/HWsehvUkISc/50004 I MEAN JUST THINK HOW LONG IT TAKES A CHILD TO LEARN TO SPEAK
trainval/HWsehvUkISc/50005 WE HAVE LOCAL NUMBERS ACCESSIBLE TO THREE QUARTERS OF A BILLION PEOPLE ON THE PLANET
trainval/HWsehvUkISc/50006 THEY MAY NOT GET THROUGH IT
trainval/HWsehvUkISc/50007 ML IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN THAT
trainval/HwxjoBQdn0s/50001 YOU CAN'T CATCH IT FROM ANYONE
trainval/HXGwJevjOfs/50001 IT IS THIS FEAR THAT'S FEEDING THE DIET INDUSTRY WHICH IS KEEPING SO MANY OF US FROM MAKING
trainval/hxJ8LELZCjo/50001 GO AND GET YOUR HEART ATTACK TREATED SOMEWHERE ELSE
trainval/hxJ8LELZCjo/50002 WE CAN DEAL WITH A HEMORRHAGE AS SOON AS A WOMAN COMES IN WE HAVE AN OPERATING THEATER THAT WORKS 24 HOURS A
trainval/hxJ8LELZCjo/50003 BUT THEY TAKE 8 OR 9 YEARS TO TRAIN AND FOR GOODNESS SAKES
trainval/hxJ8LELZCjo/50004 WHERE AM I GOING TO GET DOCTORS FROM TO WORK IN SOMALILAND
trainval/hxJ8LELZCjo/50005 OUR WOMEN DIE OF CAUSES THAT NO WOMAN IN THIS DAY AND AGE WHERE MAN HAS REACHED THE MOON NO WOMAN
trainval/hxJ8LELZCjo/50006 WHY NOT IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA
trainval/hxJ8LELZCjo/50007 WHY NOT IN ETHIOPIA
trainval/hxJ8LELZCjo/50008 WHY NOT IN ERYTREA
trainval/hxJ8LELZCjo/50009 WHY NOT IN NEIGHBOURING SOMALIA
trainval/hxJ8LELZCjo/50010 IF IT CAN BE DONE IN SOMALILAND IT CAN BE DONE ANYWHERE
trainval/HXMrzZkHKGs/50001 AND ALIGN YOURSELF TO LOVE
trainval/hxPiz2sE0h4/50001 HOW MANY IN THIS ROOM WERE BORN MEN
trainval/hxPiz2sE0h4/50002 HE WAS WRONG I AM NOT MALE
trainval/hxPiz2sE0h4/50004 ABOUT THIS TIME REN E RICHARDS WAS COMING UP AND A FEW OTHERS BUT IT WAS SO REMOTE THAT IT JUST DIDN'T SEEM LIKE
trainval/hxPiz2sE0h4/50005 THIS IS NOT JUST WEARING WOMEN'S CLOTHES THIS IS NOT JUST EXPRESSING MY FEMININE SELF THIS IS SOMETHING DEEPER
trainval/hxPiz2sE0h4/50006 WE TOOK EVERY VACATION TOGETHER
trainval/hxPiz2sE0h4/50007 I WAS NEVER A COWBOY
trainval/hxPiz2sE0h4/50008 SO WE DID GET BACK TOGETHER
trainval/HY71088saG4/50001 THEY MUST HAVE SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEIR UPBRINGING
trainval/HY71088saG4/50002 SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE PULL FACTORS
trainval/HY71088saG4/50003 AND YOU BECOME WHAT IS GOOD CHALLENGING WHAT IS EVIL
trainval/HY71088saG4/50004 ALL OF A SUDDEN WE WERE IN THEIR KITCHENS
trainval/HY71088saG4/50005 WE HAD FOREIGN TERRORIST FIGHTERS TWEETING IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGES
trainval/HY71088saG4/50006 BUT WE ALSO SAW A DANGEROUS TREND VIOLENT EXTREMISTS KNOW THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF SOCIAL
trainval/HY71088saG4/50007 SO ALL OF A SUDDEN WE COULDN'T TRACK WHERE THAT CONVERSATION WENT
trainval/HY71088saG4/50008 THEY TALKED VERY LITTLE ABOUT POLITICS
trainval/HY71088saG4/50009 I'VE BEEN THERE
trainval/HY71088saG4/50010 IF YOU WANT TO TALK I'M HERE
trainval/HY71088saG4/50011 HOW DO WE PROVIDE ALTERNATIVES FOR THAT
trainval/HYGvts8hre8/50001 AND I OFTEN WOULD SAY TO MYSELF EVEN IN MY DARKEST HOUR
trainval/HYGvts8hre8/50002 WHAT WOULD MADIBA DO
trainval/HyQp3gGYf3I/50001 NOBODY IS GOING TO ASK YOU TO TAKE A MATH TEST IN A BATHING SUIT
trainval/HyQp3gGYf3I/50002 SO ON THE AP CALCULUS EXAM RESEARCH FINDS THAT IF WE PUT THAT CHECKBOX AT THE TOP
trainval/HyQp3gGYf3I/50003 I KNEW I HAD TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THIS
trainval/HYzrdn7YLCM/50001 THAT'S THE CORNER I WANT TO EXPLORE
trainval/HYzrdn7YLCM/50002 THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE WERE WAY MORE GUYS ON DEATH ROW THAN THERE WERE LAWYERS WHO HAD BOTH THE INTEREST AND THE
trainval/HYzrdn7YLCM/50003 DO YOU KNOW WHAT ALL TIME LOW IN TEXAS MEANS
trainval/HYzrdn7YLCM/50004 IT MEANS THAT IT'S IN THE LOW 60 PERCENT
trainval/HYzrdn7YLCM/50005 AND WE COULD BE NUDGING KIDS LIKE WILL OFF OF THE PATH THAT WE'RE ON
trainval/HYzrdn7YLCM/50006 WE COULD BE PROVIDING SPECIAL SCHOOLS AT BOTH THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL AND THE MIDDLE SCHOOL LEVEL BUT EVEN IN
trainval/HYzrdn7YLCM/50007 THERE'S STILL TIME TO NUDGE THEM IF WE THINK ABOUT NUDGING THEM RATHER THAN JUST PUNISHING THEM
trainval/HyZV8Ql1PI0/50001 AND THEN I HIT HIGH SCHOOL
trainval/HyZV8Ql1PI0/50002 BUT I DON'T WANT OUR CHILDREN TO WAIT THAT LONG
trainval/HyZV8Ql1PI0/50003 AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IT'S NOT THE OPPOSITE OF SUCCESS AS MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE IT IS A KEY COMPONENT OF IT
trainval/HyZV8Ql1PI0/50004 IN FACT I BELIEVE OUT OF ALL THE THINGS WE SHOULD BE TEACHING IN OUR SCHOOLS RIGHT NOW THE MOST IMPORTANT THING OF ALL IS
trainval/HyZV8Ql1PI0/50005 OR HOW ABOUT THIS ONE
trainval/HyZV8Ql1PI0/50006 AN EVENT EXPLODING WITH OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE DEEPEN UNDERSTANDING AND TO EMOTIONALLY
trainval/HyZV8Ql1PI0/50007 IT HAPPENS TO BE THE DEFINITION OF THE WORD EDUCATION
trainval/HyZV8Ql1PI0/50008 LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF A PERSON WHOM I THINK IS ON A RIGHT TRACK
trainval/HyZV8Ql1PI0/50009 HIS NAME IS EDWARD BURGER
trainval/HyZV8Ql1PI0/50010 AND DON'T WE NEED MORE OF BOTH OF THOSE IN THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE IN TODAY
trainval/HyZV8Ql1PI0/50011 THE REASON FOR THIS IS SIMPLE
trainval/HyZV8Ql1PI0/50013 BUT I KNOW WE HAVE TO START SMALL
trainval/HyZV8Ql1PI0/50014 AT MY SCHOOL I TALK TO MY TEACHERS ABOUT THIS CONCEPT AND ASK THEM TO GO BACK TO THE CLASS AND TO CELEBRATE SHARE AND LEARN
trainval/HyZV8Ql1PI0/50015 RATHER THEY WENT IN THE MIDST OF ONGOING STRUGGLE
trainval/HyZV8Ql1PI0/50016 AND WE START THINKING ALONG THOSE LINES
trainval/HyZV8Ql1PI0/50017 I WANT YOU TO EXPERIENCE THE FRUSTRATION OF NOT SOLVING YOUR PROBLEM OR CREATING YOUR IDEA ON THE
trainval/hz2ONnzRANs/50001 AND THEN THEY'VE GOT ME MAPPED
trainval/hz2ONnzRANs/50002 AH YOU'RE A KENYAN ASIAN
trainval/hz2ONnzRANs/50003 I'VE WORKED WITH ONE OF THOSE
trainval/hz2ONnzRANs/50004 THE FIRST ACT BY SALAFI JIHADI GROUPS WHEN THEY TAKE OVER AN AREA IS TO DESTROY
trainval/HzySGhX8SCc/50001 ISAAC ASIMOV POPULARIZED THIS PERSONA WITH HIS THREE LAWS OF ROBOTICS
trainval/HzySGhX8SCc/50002 NOW WHAT WORKED THERE
trainval/i0a61wFaF8A/50001 THAT'S NOT WHAT GREAT SPEAKERS DO
trainval/i0a61wFaF8A/50002 THEY HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH
trainval/i0a61wFaF8A/50004 IT BRINGS US ALL TOGETHER
trainval/i0a61wFaF8A/50005 EVERYONE WHO STUDIES PUBLIC SPEAKING PUTS THAT SPEECH IN THEIR LIST
trainval/i0a61wFaF8A/50006 EVERY SINGLE PERSON I'VE WORKED WITH HAS THE ABILITY IN THEIR OWN WAY TO BREAK THROUGH
trainval/i0QKBKWnkxg/50001 HOW DOES LAUGHING MAKE YOU FEEL
trainval/i0QKBKWnkxg/50002 DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING
trainval/i0QKBKWnkxg/50003 EVEN JUST SMILING RATHER THAN LAUGHING SENDS A SIGNAL TO YOUR BRAIN AND INCREASES THOSE HAPPY
trainval/i0QKBKWnkxg/50004 SO IT'S ALL ABOUT SEX GUYS
trainval/i0QKBKWnkxg/50005 I KNOW I'M A MOTHER OF TWO CHILDREN AND I KNOW THAT WE DO THINGS LIKE WE TICKLE OUR CHILDREN TO
trainval/i0QKBKWnkxg/50006 I SAID WELL JUST LIKE YOU REALLY
trainval/i0QKBKWnkxg/50007 AND I SAID WHAT ARE YOU UP TO
trainval/i0QKBKWnkxg/50008 I SAID WHY DON'T YOU COME ALONG
trainval/i0QKBKWnkxg/50009 YOU'D PROBABLY ENJOY A GOOD LAUGH
trainval/i0QKBKWnkxg/50010 I DON'T LIKE LAUGHING SHE SAID
trainval/i0QKBKWnkxg/50011 CRYING IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN YOU CRY YOU ARE EXCRETING NEGATIVE HORMONES THAT ARE
trainval/i0QKBKWnkxg/50012 THEY'RE OFTEN USED IN DRAMA
trainval/i0QKBKWnkxg/50013 LITTLE CHILDREN WILL LAUGH LITTLE BABIES WILL LAUGH AT ANYTHING
trainval/i0QKBKWnkxg/50014 THAT IS BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT NO FILTERS
trainval/i0QKBKWnkxg/50015 MY INHIBITIONS HAVE DROPPED AND THAT'S WHY WE CHANGE
trainval/i0QKBKWnkxg/50016 WE GO FROM STRENGTH TO STRENGTH
trainval/i0QKBKWnkxg/50017 WE'VE RUN A COMPETITION THAT HAD 70 ENTRANCES IN THE FIRST YEAR
trainval/i0QKBKWnkxg/50018 WE'VE JUST CLOSED THE ENTRY FOR THIS YEAR
trainval/i0QKBKWnkxg/50019 WE'VE HAD OVER 400 WOMEN ENTERED
trainval/i0QKBKWnkxg/50020 THEY WOULD DO DIFFERENT TYPE OF MATERIAL
trainval/i0QKBKWnkxg/50021 THERE'S BOUND TO BE SOMEBODY WHO THINKS THEY'RE FUNNY IN THE WORKPLACE
trainval/i0QKBKWnkxg/50022 IT'S ALL ABOUT IMPROVISATION IT'S ALL ABOUT THINKING ON YOUR FEET IT'S ALL ABOUT TELLING A STORY IN AN AMUSING
trainval/i0QKBKWnkxg/50024 SO THAT'S MY PRESCRIPTION FOR THE FUTURE
trainval/i0QKBKWnkxg/50025 HUMOR IS REALLY REALLY ACCESSIBLE NOW JUST LIKE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD MUSIC
trainval/i18gxxnJ2nc/50001 THE MEDITATION INSTRUCTION IS VERY SIMPLE
trainval/I1cGiNnJZgU/50001 WHAT AM I GOING TO DO
trainval/I1cGiNnJZgU/50002 HOW WILL I PAY THEM
trainval/I1cGiNnJZgU/50003 IN WHAT CURRENCY WILL I PAY THEM
trainval/I1cGiNnJZgU/50004 YOU WAKE UP ONE MORNING HOWEVER AND YOU DISCOVER THAT THE REASON THERE ARE NO RULES IS BECAUSE THERE'S NO GOVERNMENT
trainval/I1cGiNnJZgU/50005 DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS IS AN AMAZING ORGANIZATION DEDICATED AND DESIGNED TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY CARE
trainval/I1cGiNnJZgU/50006 5 MILLION PEOPLE
trainval/I1cGiNnJZgU/50007 I WONDER WHAT THAT MEANS
trainval/i1OAMgrsUUw/50001 I'VE HAD SOME AMAZING EXPERIENCES WITH AMAZING TEACHERS WHO OPENED MY EYES
trainval/i1OAMgrsUUw/50002 RESULTS DOMINATE SCHOOLS AND SCHOOLS DOMINATE US THE
trainval/i2a8pDbCabg/50001 AND A DIGITAL TRAIL LIKE THE ONE DANIEL WAS TALKING ABOUT IS NO DIFFERENT
trainval/i2a8pDbCabg/50002 A FRIEND OF MINE WHOM I SHARED AN OFFICE WITH AT THE LAB HAPPENED TO SEE THIS
trainval/i2a8pDbCabg/50003 AND THERE ARE MANY MORE METHODS THAT WE CAN USE
trainval/i2t8pN5ecMo/50001 BLACK AND WHITE THINKING
trainval/i2t8pN5ecMo/50002 I WAS AT UNIVERSITY AND ANXIETY WAS BEGINNING TO TAKE A STRONG HOLD
trainval/i2t8pN5ecMo/50003 I'D SUBMIT TO IMPERFECTION AND I WOULD FACE FAILURE
trainval/i2t8pN5ecMo/50004 LET LIFE HAPPEN
trainval/I2xDZlpInik/50001 BUT EVENTUALLY THE STORM CLOUDS BUILT AND THEN WHEN THE RAINS CAME THE FLOODS WERE EPIC
trainval/I2xDZlpInik/50002 SO LET'S LOOK AT THAT
trainval/I2xDZlpInik/50003 WE STILL HAD THESE SPONGE LIKE FORESTS ALONG THE RIVER THAT WOULD ABSORB THAT RAIN AND
trainval/I2xDZlpInik/50004 AND THEN BUT DON'T WORRY NO ONE WAS HURT BECAUSE AT JUST THE LAST MOMENT BEFORE THEIR PART OF THE
trainval/I2xDZlpInik/50005 WE SQUANDER THE NATURAL ABUNDANCE THAT WE ALREADY HAVE AND WE SPEND VAST AMOUNTS OF RESOURCES TRYING TO
trainval/I2xDZlpInik/50006 HOW WAS HE TO FEED THEM
trainval/I2xDZlpInik/50007 HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT DOING THAT
trainval/I2xDZlpInik/50008 EVERY TIME IT RAINED HE'D BE OUT THERE RUNNING WATCHING SEEING WHAT WAS GOING ON
trainval/I2xDZlpInik/50009 AND AS HE SAID GETTING VERY WET BUT BEING VERY HAPPY
trainval/I2xDZlpInik/50010 AND BY DOING THIS THOUGH IT WAS MUCH MORE MANAGEABLE AND HE COULD MOVE ALL THE WATER WITH THE FREE POWER OF GRAVITY
trainval/I2xDZlpInik/50011 AND HOW DID WE BEGIN
trainval/I2xDZlpInik/50012 WELL THE SAME AS THE PHIRIS
trainval/I2xDZlpInik/50013 WHY THE DIFFERENCE
trainval/I2xDZlpInik/50014 SO TO FURTHER SPARK THAT WILL I WROTE AND PUBLISHED HOW TO BOOKS DID COUNTLESS TALKS AND WITH OTHERS
trainval/I2xDZlpInik/50016 IT'S ABOUT PARTNERING WITH NATURAL SYSTEMS NOT FIGHTING THEM
trainval/I4fJPKSKbrA/50001 THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL WILL WE DISAPPOINT THESE PEOPLE
trainval/I4fJPKSKbrA/50002 I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS CALL FOR 20 YEARS
trainval/I4fJPKSKbrA/50003 I WOULD HAVE PAID TO DO THIS PROJECT
trainval/I4fJPKSKbrA/50004 SO WHAT I WAS DOING IT WAS LIKE A BLESSING IN DISGUISE
trainval/I4fJPKSKbrA/50005 SO THESE SAME WOMEN NOW HAVE A LITTLE BUSINESS
trainval/I4PU2JlhO80/50001 I DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT BUT SHE WAS STUNNING AND I'D NEVER MET A MODEL LIKE THIS BEFORE
trainval/I4PU2JlhO80/50002 AND I SAID OKAY WELL THEN WHAT DO WE DO HERE
trainval/I4PU2JlhO80/50003 WHERE IS HE
trainval/i63jTStjZSQ/50001 BUT I'D NEVER DONE ANYTHING ABOUT MYSELF
trainval/i63jTStjZSQ/50002 I'D NEVER REALLY MEMORIALIZED MYSELF
trainval/I64CQp6z0Pk/50001 I'VE HAD SOMEONE WRITE AND SAY SCIENTIFICALLY SPEAKING WHAT IS THE BEST AND FASTEST WAY TO HIDE A
trainval/I64CQp6z0Pk/50002 HOW MUCH ROOM IS THAT
trainval/I64CQp6z0Pk/50003 AND IN FACT YOU CAN JUST LOOK AT PIZZA DELIVERY DRIVERS
trainval/i6SbQqqRVtM/50001 WELL THE ULTIMATE REASON OF WHY I'M HERE TODAY IS NOT TO LECTURE YOU ABOUT SCIENCE OR ABOUT
trainval/i6SbQqqRVtM/50002 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A LITTLE BOY IN A LITTLE PLACE WHO LOVES LOVES TO
trainval/i6SbQqqRVtM/50003 WELL I MEAN THAT'S NOT TRUE BUT ANYWAY
trainval/i6SbQqqRVtM/50004 HE WANTED TO QUIT EVERYTHING
trainval/i6SbQqqRVtM/50005 EVERYWHERE HE LOOKED WAS THE SIGHT OF HIS FAMILY OF HIS FRIENDS
trainval/i6SbQqqRVtM/50006 WELL I AM THAT LITTLE BOY
trainval/i6SbQqqRVtM/50007 THEY DESERVE IT
trainval/i73jKeE8h3A/50001 I COACH THEM SO THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND THEY CAN COMPETE AND THEN WE CELEBRATE WHAT THEY DO CORRECT EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T EXPECT
trainval/I8tg0Myjimg/50002 WHAT IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING THAT HAPPENED IN YOUR LIFE
trainval/I9cmQFj13rc/50001 I WAS WORRIED THAT I WOULD BE STEPPING ON SOMEONE'S TOES IF I GOT INVOLVED
trainval/I9cmQFj13rc/50002 MY STORY BEGINS ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO IN THE SUMMER OF 2008
trainval/I9cmQFj13rc/50003 BUT I WAS STILL INTERESTED
trainval/I9cmQFj13rc/50004 HOW CAN I HELP
trainval/I9cmQFj13rc/50005 HOW CAN WE HELP
trainval/I9cmQFj13rc/50006 WE GOT A PRETTY AMAZING ANSWER
trainval/I9cmQFj13rc/50007 OLPC ASKED ME AND MY FRIEND PAUL TO RUN A NEW PROGRAM FOR THEM CALLED OLPC CORPS
trainval/I9cmQFj13rc/50009 WE'D ASK THEM TO PARTNER WITH SCHOOLS AND NON PROFITS IN AFRICA
trainval/I9cmQFj13rc/50010 WE'D FUND THEM TRAIN THEM SEND THEM LAPTOPS
trainval/I9cmQFj13rc/50011 OLPC BELIEVES THESE THINGS TOO
trainval/I9cmQFj13rc/50012 BUT I TOOK THE PLUNGE
trainval/I9cmQFj13rc/50013 WHEN I FIRST GOT INVOLVED IT WAS A SMALL STEP
trainval/I9cmQFj13rc/50014 I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN FROM MY INVOLVEMENT
trainval/I9cmQFj13rc/50015 BUT IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO TAKE THAT STEP
trainval/I9cmQFj13rc/50016 BECAUSE WITHOUT IT I WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THIS PASSION I HAVE FOR THE PROJECT
trainval/I9cmQFj13rc/50017 IT'S VERY NATURAL FOR ME TO THINK ABOUT HOW MY ACTIONS BENEFIT ME
trainval/I9cmQFj13rc/50018 BUT I TRIED SOMETHING WHEN I GOT INVOLVED WITH OLPC
trainval/I9cmQFj13rc/50019 IT DEMANDS ACTION
trainval/I9cmQFj13rc/50020 I WANTED TO GET INVOLVED TO PRODUCE
trainval/I9cmQFj13rc/50021 SHARING IDEAS IS WONDERFUL AND INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT
trainval/I9cmQFj13rc/50022 BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR THE WORLD THAT WE WANT TO CREATE
trainval/I9cmQFj13rc/50023 YOU HAVE TIME
trainval/I9cmQFj13rc/50024 YOU HAVE TALENT
trainval/I9cmQFj13rc/50025 I DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT OLPC BEFORE MY FRIENDS GOT INVOLVED
trainval/I9tB6Q5bmcQ/50001 AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT ANNUAL PREGNANCIES AND HIV POSITIVE MOTHERS
trainval/I9tB6Q5bmcQ/50002 AND YET THE REALITY IN RESOURCE POOR COUNTRIES IN THE ABSENCE OF TESTS AND TREATMENT 40 PERCENT
trainval/I9tB6Q5bmcQ/50003 SO IT'S THE TEST A MOTHER GETS WHEN SHE COMES IN
trainval/I9tB6Q5bmcQ/50004 AND THE NURSE TAKES YOU INTO A ROOM AND SHE TELLS YOU ABOUT THE TESTS AND HIV AND THE MEDICINES YOU CAN TAKE AND HOW TO TAKE CARE OF
trainval/I9tB6Q5bmcQ/50005 AND THEN YOU'RE OUT ON THE STREET AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO
trainval/I9tB6Q5bmcQ/50006 BUT WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS AND SOME GOOD
trainval/I9tB6Q5bmcQ/50007 AND I WANT TO CHANGE THE STORY A LITTLE BIT
trainval/I9tB6Q5bmcQ/50008 THESE MOTHERS WE CALL THEM MENTOR MOTHERS ARE ABLE TO ENGAGE WOMEN WHO JUST LIKE THEMSELVES
trainval/I9tB6Q5bmcQ/50009 NOW DOCTORS AND NURSES THEY TOO GET TRAINED
trainval/I9tB6Q5bmcQ/50010 BUT SO OFTEN THEY ONLY GET TRAINED ONCE SO THEY'RE NOT AWARE OF NEW MEDICINES NEW GUIDELINES AS THEY COME OUT
trainval/I9tB6Q5bmcQ/50011 THE FATHER AND THE MOTHER TOGETHER THEY GET THE RESULTS
trainval/I9tB6Q5bmcQ/50012 AND THIS IS SO IMPORTANT IN BREAKING THROUGH THE STIGMA
trainval/I9tB6Q5bmcQ/50013 AND IF WE CAN CHANGE ENOUGH COMMUNITIES WE CAN CHANGE NATIONAL ATTITUDES
trainval/I9tB6Q5bmcQ/50014 WE CAN CHANGE NATIONAL ATTITUDES TO WOMEN AND NATIONAL ATTITUDES TO HIV
trainval/I9tB6Q5bmcQ/50015 I'M HIV POSITIVE
trainval/I9tB6Q5bmcQ/50016 I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO THROW ME OUT OF THE FAMILY
trainval/I9tB6Q5bmcQ/50017 THE LAST SISTER STOOD UP AND SAID I'M ALSO POSITIVE
trainval/I9tB6Q5bmcQ/50018 I STARTED THE PROGRAM IN CAPETOWN SOUTH AFRICA BACK IN 2001
trainval/I9weytKalQQ/50001 I SOON REALIZED THAT MOST LABS IN MY HOMETOWN OF MONTGOMERY ALABAMA DID NOT HAVE SPOTS FOR HIGH
trainval/I9weytKalQQ/50002 SURE I HAD NO PERSONAL CONTACTS BUT AFTER BROWSING THROUGH TONS OF ARTICLES ONLINE I REALIZED THAT
trainval/I9weytKalQQ/50003 SOME SAID NO NICELY SOME IGNORED MY EMAIL
trainval/I9weytKalQQ/50004 I RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM A PROFESSOR OF HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL WHO TOLD ME THAT IF I SENT RECOMMENDATION LETTERS AND MY
trainval/I9weytKalQQ/50005 ANOTHER PROBLEM ALSO EXISTED
trainval/I9weytKalQQ/50006 SO TO HAVE THE IDEA TRULY WORK OUT NOT ONLY DID I HAVE TO GATHER THE PERMISSION OF MY PARENTS TO GO AND WORK IN ANOTHER CITY BUT
trainval/I9weytKalQQ/50007 INSTEAD OF GOVERNMENT WE THINK OF ANARCHY
trainval/I9weytKalQQ/50008 GO TO THAT NEW RESTAURANT
trainval/I9weytKalQQ/50009 EXPLORE THAT NEW IDEA YOU HAD
trainval/IAAK7GWQ32Y/50001 BUT IT'S OK MY MOM DOESN'T LIKE CURSE WORDS ANYWAYS
trainval/IaMnRrrQx48/50001 THAT ALL CHANGED WITH ONE INCIDENT
trainval/iARReKKgETs/50001 SO THIS IS A PROBLEM
trainval/iARReKKgETs/50002 AND THIS WAS THE SPARKLE OF WHAT I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT TODAY
trainval/iARReKKgETs/50003 SO WHAT DO WE NEED
trainval/iARReKKgETs/50004 AND HOW CAN IT BE DONE
trainval/iARReKKgETs/50005 ACTUALLY WE NEED THREE THINGS
trainval/iARReKKgETs/50006 WHEN WE SPEAK ABOUT SCIENCE WE NEED TO SPEAK IN AN EASY AND SIMPLE ARABIC LANGUAGE
trainval/iARReKKgETs/50007 THIS IS AMAZING
trainval/iARReKKgETs/50008 IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTION ABOUT ANYTHING GO AND ASK THE SYRIAN RESEARCHERS
trainval/IaWeJ8V3pg4/50001 BUT IT'S NOT A LINEAR PATH
trainval/IaWeJ8V3pg4/50002 IN FACT IT'S A CIRCUIT THAT GOES THROUGH OUR EMOTIONAL CENTERS
trainval/IaWeJ8V3pg4/50003 AS HUMAN BEINGS WE ARE EMOTIONAL BEINGS
trainval/IaWeJ8V3pg4/50004 IT'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PLANTATION MODEL WHERE AS WE CONSUMED RESOURCES WE TAKE IT DOWN TO
trainval/IaWeJ8V3pg4/50005 I'VE BEEN READING ALL THESE BOOKS ABOUT INNOVATION
trainval/IaWeJ8V3pg4/50006 INTELLECTUALLY THERE IS PROBABLY NO REASON TO BUY A LOTTERY TICKET
trainval/IaWeJ8V3pg4/50007 BUT IN THE MOMENT WE BUY THAT LOTTERY TICKET SOMETHING HAPPENS
trainval/IaWeJ8V3pg4/50008 WE ACTUALLY FEEL GOOD
trainval/IaWeJ8V3pg4/50009 THE REASON WE FEEL GOOD IS BECAUSE OUR MIND CREATES A FUTURE MEMORY OF WHAT WE'RE DOING
trainval/IaWeJ8V3pg4/50010 WHEN THEY GO TO APPLY THEM THEY TEND NOT TO WORK AND THEY CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY
trainval/IaWeJ8V3pg4/50012 PEOPLE LOVE THEIR MOTOROLA PHONES
trainval/IaWeJ8V3pg4/50013 WE USE THEM
trainval/IaWeJ8V3pg4/50014 IN SOME WAYS THEY ARE SUPERIOR PIECES OF TECHNOLOGY
trainval/IaWeJ8V3pg4/50015 BUT STEVE JOBS FOUND A WAY OF EMBEDDING LOVE AND EMOTION INTO EACH OF THE PRODUCTS
trainval/iAZwvTV3CyQ/50001 WE KNOW THAT YES THEY DO
trainval/iAZwvTV3CyQ/50002 THAT HAS COLLAPSED THAT'S A PROFOUND CULTURAL CHANGE
trainval/ibcgMSS0mAs/50001 MY MOTHER MY FOUR SISTERS AND MY DAUGHTER AND I
trainval/ibcgMSS0mAs/50002 IT'S A COMBINATION OF EVERYBODY WITH ONE EXCEPTION
trainval/ibcgMSS0mAs/50003 WE HAVE MORE BLACK AND BROWN MEN WHO ARE INCARCERATED
trainval/ibcgMSS0mAs/50004 AND TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES
trainval/ibcgMSS0mAs/50005 I AM THERESA HODGE
trainval/ibcgMSS0mAs/50006 WELL I KNEW IT WASN'T MY NAME
trainval/IBoJcDlqmo0/50001 THEY CAN IDENTIFY A PERSON
trainval/IBoJcDlqmo0/50002 IF THEY REALLY COULD DO THAT PERFECTLY I WOULD BE REALLY IMPRESSED
trainval/IBoJcDlqmo0/50003 DARPA WAS TRYING TO HAVE PEOPLE BUILD EMERGENCY ROBOTS AND PEOPLE DID ALL KINDS OF WORK IN THEIR LAB TO BUILD ROBOTS THAT COULD DO THINGS
trainval/IBoJcDlqmo0/50004 WE WANT THE AI TO REALLY DO IT RIGHT
trainval/IBoJcDlqmo0/50005 WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BEHIND THIS DATA
trainval/IBoJcDlqmo0/50006 WHY ARE YOU WEARING A HAT NOW
trainval/IBoJcDlqmo0/50007 SHE'S CONSTANTLY ASKING WHY QUESTIONS
trainval/IBoJcDlqmo0/50008 IF YOU'VE WORKED WITH SIRI YOU KNOW THAT SYNTAX IS STILL A CHALLENGE SOMETIMES FOR COMPUTERS
trainval/IBoJcDlqmo0/50009 PICTURE OF A GOLF BALL AND A GOLF BALL
trainval/IBoJcDlqmo0/50010 I THINK MAYBE WE COULD MAKE SOME PROGRESS
trainval/IBoJcDlqmo0/50011 BUT WE ARE BETTER AT ASKING WHY
trainval/IBoJcDlqmo0/50012 AND UNDERSTANDING SCIENCE
trainval/IBoJcDlqmo0/50013 THIS WATCH THAT I HAVE CAN DO EVERYTHING THE ENIAC COULD DO WITH AN ENTIRE ROOM 60 YEARS AGO
trainval/IBoJcDlqmo0/50014 MAYBE IT'S TIME THAT WE TRY
trainval/IBoJcDlqmo0/50015 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/IBoJcDlqmo0/50016 BUT IT MATTERS WHEN IT COMES TO THINGS LIKE MEDICINE
trainval/icI94blMKIc/50001 AND A WAY TO THINK OF THIS IS TO IMAGINE YOURSELF FLOATING DOWN A RIVER WITH YOUR FRIENDS SHARING THE SAME
trainval/icI94blMKIc/50002 NOW IN WEST AFRICAN SOCIETIES ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT SPEAK TONAL LANGUAGES LIKE BAMBARA
trainval/icI94blMKIc/50003 NOW A TRAINED DRUMMER CAN JUST AS EASILY SPEAK THE RHYTHM WITH THEIR MOUTH AS THEY CAN WITH THEIR HANDS ON THE DRUM
trainval/icI94blMKIc/50004 BOTH MODES OF EXPRESSION ARE INTIMATELY CONNECTED
trainval/icI94blMKIc/50005 SPEAKING IN THE MOUTH THE DRUMMER EMULATES THE SOUNDS OF THE DRUM AS A STREAM OF SYLLABLES AND
trainval/icI94blMKIc/50006 THE GREAT EMISSARY OF WEST AFRICAN DRUMMING TO NORTH AMERICA BABATUNDE OLATUNJI
trainval/icI94blMKIc/50007 I THINK WE'RE HARDWIRED FOR IT
trainval/iclWthSVvBs/50001 MAYBE A PET DIED
trainval/iclWthSVvBs/50002 SOMETIMES IT'S JUST A MISCOMMUNICATION BETWEEN TWO KIDS
trainval/iclWthSVvBs/50004 SOME OF THE PLAYERS GET ANGRY VERY EASILY
trainval/iclWthSVvBs/50005 IT STARTED TO FRUSTRATE THE OTHER PLAYERS
trainval/iCvmsMzlF7o/50001 I'M A QUALITATIVE RESEARCHER
trainval/iCvmsMzlF7o/50002 AND MAYBE STORIES ARE JUST DATA WITH A SOUL
trainval/iCvmsMzlF7o/50003 AND SHE CALLED AND SHE SAID I'M REALLY STRUGGLING WITH HOW TO WRITE ABOUT YOU ON THE LITTLE FLYER
trainval/iCvmsMzlF7o/50004 AND I THOUGHT WELL WHAT'S THE STRUGGLE
trainval/iCvmsMzlF7o/50006 SO I THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO START WITH CONNECTION
trainval/iCvmsMzlF7o/50007 WELL APPARENTLY THIS IS THE WAY MY WORK WENT AS WELL BECAUSE WHEN YOU ASK PEOPLE ABOUT LOVE
trainval/iCvmsMzlF7o/50008 AND SHE SAID BUT THE THING I LIKED ABOUT YOUR TALK IS YOU'RE A STORYTELLER
trainval/iCvmsMzlF7o/50009 AS YOU KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO TURN OUT WELL
trainval/iCvmsMzlF7o/50010 I HAVE A SLIGHT OFFICE SUPPLY ADDICTION BUT THAT'S ANOTHER TALK
trainval/iCvmsMzlF7o/50011 THEY JUST TALKED ABOUT IT BEING NECESSARY
trainval/iCvmsMzlF7o/50012 AND THE FIRST WORDS THAT CAME TO MY MIND WERE WHOLE HEARTED
trainval/iCvmsMzlF7o/50013 LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE WHEN YOU CALL YOUR FRIENDS AND SAY I THINK I NEED TO SEE SOMEBODY
trainval/iCvmsMzlF7o/50014 SHE SAID WHAT'S GOING ON
trainval/iCvmsMzlF7o/50015 AND SHE SAID WHAT'S THE STRUGGLE
trainval/iCvmsMzlF7o/50016 AND I SAID BUT HERE'S THE THING NO FAMILY STUFF NO CHILDHOOD SHIT
trainval/iCvmsMzlF7o/50017 AND IT TOOK ABOUT A YEAR
trainval/iCvmsMzlF7o/50018 AND SO THEN I WENT BACK INTO THE RESEARCH AND SPENT THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY THE WHOLE
trainval/iCvmsMzlF7o/50019 WHY DO WE STRUGGLE WITH IT SO MUCH
trainval/iCvmsMzlF7o/50020 HERE'S VULNERABILITY HERE'S GRIEF HERE'S SHAME HERE'S FEAR HERE'S DISAPPOINTMENT
trainval/iCvmsMzlF7o/50021 YOU CANNOT SELECTIVELY NUMB
trainval/iCvmsMzlF7o/50022 THIS IS WHAT POLITICS LOOKS LIKE TODAY
trainval/iCvmsMzlF7o/50023 THERE'S NO DISCOURSE ANYMORE
trainval/iCvmsMzlF7o/50024 YOU KNOW HOW BLAME IS DESCRIBED IN THE RESEARCH
trainval/iCvmsMzlF7o/50025 OUR JOB IS TO LOOK AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/iCvmsMzlF7o/50026 CAN I BELIEVE IN THIS THIS PASSIONATELY
trainval/iCvmsMzlF7o/50027 CAN I BE THIS FIERCE ABOUT THIS
trainval/iCvmsMzlF7o/50028 AND I KNOW THAT'S KNOWING LAUGHTER
trainval/iCXfJVCg1LA/50001 THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED THERE REALLY HATED IT
trainval/IDqMB6C1uys/50001 WHAT ARE THE GENES THAT WE HAVE
trainval/IDqMB6C1uys/50002 WE'RE ONLY TEN PERCENT
trainval/IDqMB6C1uys/50003 SO WE JUST HEARD HOW WONDERFUL IT IS TO LOOK AT THE ASTRONOMY AND BE HUMBLED
trainval/IDqMB6C1uys/50004 I WOULD SUGGEST WE PROBABLY JUST NEED TO LOOK INSIDE OF US AND REALLY GET HUMBLE BECAUSE THE
trainval/IDqMB6C1uys/50005 AND MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME ALL ABOUT GERMS AND HOW BAD THEY WERE AND YOU SHOULD ALWAYS WASH YOUR HANDS AND I
trainval/IDqMB6C1uys/50006 SO IF YOU BREED A LITTLE MOUSE THAT HAS NO BIOME THIS LITTLE CREATURE IS VERY VULNERABLE TO
trainval/IDqMB6C1uys/50007 THESE KINDS OF THINGS ARE WHEN THERE IS A DYSBIOSIS THERE'S AN IMBALANCE BETWEEN THE GOOD
trainval/IDqMB6C1uys/50008 ALSO WE'RE BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND THAT A LOT OF THE WHAT IS CALLED AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES
trainval/IDqMB6C1uys/50009 HOW MANY GENES
trainval/IDqMB6C1uys/50010 YOU KNOW THEY DON'T KIND OF HANG OUT WITH THEIR PUPPY BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND THEY DON'T EAT WELL AND THEY DON'T DO THINGS
trainval/IDqMB6C1uys/50011 THEY HAVE A NIGHT AND DAY RHYTHM JUST LIKE WE DO
trainval/IDqMB6C1uys/50012 SO FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE TO RESPECT THEM
trainval/IDSSieLCmS4/50001 THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND US
trainval/IDSSieLCmS4/50002 SO IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF WAITING FOR THE NEXT ONE AND THEN MARVELING AT HOW WE COULD HAVE BEEN SO STUPID AS NOT TO
trainval/IDSSieLCmS4/50003 AND ARISTOTLE SAID HAH THEY APPRECIATED THAT SOMETIMES TO
trainval/IDSSieLCmS4/50004 WISE PEOPLE KNOW HOW TO IMPROVISE
trainval/IDSSieLCmS4/50006 THEN HE LOST HIS JOB
trainval/IDSSieLCmS4/50007 HE ROBBED HIM AT GUNPOINT
trainval/IDSSieLCmS4/50009 ALL THIS WOULD DO IS WRECK A FAMILY
trainval/IDSSieLCmS4/50011 THE MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE FOR ARMED ROBBERY IS FIVE YEARS
trainval/IDSSieLCmS4/50012 A WISE PERSON KNOWS WHEN TO IMPROVISE
trainval/IDSSieLCmS4/50013 SO THAT IS AN EXAMPLE BOTH OF WISDOM IN PRACTICE AND THE SUBVERSION OF WISDOM
trainval/IDSSieLCmS4/50014 NOW CONSIDER MS
trainval/IDSSieLCmS4/50015 AND MOST IMPORTANT A WISE PERSON DOES THIS IMPROVISING AND RULE BENDING IN THE SERVICE OF THE RIGHT AIMS
trainval/IDSSieLCmS4/50016 IF YOU ARE A RULE BENDER AND AN IMPROVISER MOSTLY TO SERVE YOURSELF WHAT YOU GET IS RUTHLESS
trainval/IDSSieLCmS4/50018 AND SECOND THEY DEMORALIZE THE ACTIVITY ITSELF
trainval/IDSSieLCmS4/50019 SO IT MATTERS THAT YOU DO THIS WISE PRACTICE IN THE SERVICE OF OTHERS AND NOT IN THE SERVICE OF
trainval/IDSSieLCmS4/50020 IF YOU REWARD TEACHERS FOR KIDS' TEST SCORES THEY STOP CARING ABOUT EDUCATING AND ONLY CARE ABOUT TEST
trainval/IDSSieLCmS4/50021 AND SO WHAT THEY DO IS THEY FOLLOW THE SCRIPTS BUT THEY FOLLOW THE SCRIPTS AT DOUBLE TIME AND
trainval/IDSSieLCmS4/50022 HE WAS BUSTED IN A DRUG SWEEP
trainval/IDSSieLCmS4/50023 JUDGE RUSSELL CREATED THE VETERANS' COURT
trainval/IDSSieLCmS4/50025 THEY DIDN'T MAKE LOANS AND THEN SELL THE LOANS
trainval/IDSSieLCmS4/50027 SO THE PATIENTS ARE NOT ORGAN SYSTEMS AND THEY'RE NOT DISEASES THEY'RE PEOPLE PEOPLE WITH LIVES
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50001 AND I CAN REMEMBER GOING HOME IN TEARS QUITE OFTEN
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50002 WELL YOU'VE GOT TO TELL SOMEONE
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50003 I'M SURE WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50004 I KNEW THAT MY SCHOOL HAD TO MARK THIS
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50005 MY SCHOOL HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50006 SO I RATHER CHEEKILY CREATED A ROLE FOR MYSELF
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50007 STUDENT ANTI BULLYING COORDINATOR
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50008 NOW MY HEAD TEACHER WASN'T SO CONVINCED ABOUT THIS
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50009 HE WASN'T REALLY SURE WHERE THAT ALL CAME FROM AND WHAT IT MEANT AND I HAD TO CONVINCE HIM AND A LOT OF
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50010 BUT EVENTUALLY HE SAID TO ME
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50011 WHAT AM I GOING TO ACHIEVE IN THOSE THREE YEARS THAT I CAN'T ACHIEVE NOW
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50013 I SUPPOSE IT WAS ALL ABOUT MAKING THESE YOUNG PEOPLE MINI CELEBRITIES IN THEIR SCHOOL
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50014 AND ON EVERY SMILE AND COMPLIMENT DAY 365 INDIVIDUALS WERE RECOGNIZED FOR THAT POSITIVE
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50015 I WOULD VISIT LOTS OF SCHOOLS AND I WOULD BE INSPIRED BY THE DIFFERENT IDEAS THAT YOUNG
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50016 I WANTED TO CREATE A TV ADVERT
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50017 I WANTED EVERY SINGLE CITIZEN TO KNOW THAT THEY SHOULD BE AN ACTIVE CITIZEN ONE THAT DOESN'T STAND
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50018 I WANTED EVERYONE TO KNOW THAT THEY COULD PLAY A PART IN TACKLING BULLYING
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50019 AND THIS IS IT
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50021 AND IF YOU'RE SITTING THERE OR WATCHING THIS THINKING WHAT'S THE BIG SOCIETY
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50022 AND I ALSO SAID TO HIM LOOK JACK YOUR SCHOOL'S IN LONDON
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50023 HOW ABOUT YOU COME TO IT
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50024 I DIDN'T HEAR FROM JACK AFTER THAT
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50025 DO A BIT OF RESEARCH AND MAYBE YOU'LL COME UP WITH THE ANSWER
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50026 EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US CAN DO SOMETHING FOR SOMEONE ELSE
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50029 BUT I THINK WHATEVER HAPPENS I'M GOING TO CONTINUE DOING WHAT I'M DOING BECAUSE I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT THAT
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50030 BUT MAYBE THEY COULD SEE HOW MANY OTHER PASSIONATE PEOPLE THERE ARE IN SCHOOLS IN COMMUNITIES IN WORK PLACES THAT HAVE
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50031 AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE COMMUNITY BEGINS THAT'S WHERE WE GET OUR SENSE OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A COMMUNITY WHERE WE CAN
trainval/IdW9UYlxlVY/50032 AND IF WE CAN GET YOUNG PEOPLE DOING GOOD STUFF IN THEIR SCHOOL THEN THEY'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO GO OUT INTO THEIR COMMUNITY
trainval/iE7YRHxwoDs/50001 SO I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU A STORY ABOUT A SELF STUDY SELF EMPOWERING COMPUTER SCIENCE
trainval/iE7YRHxwoDs/50002 OR A MAC WHICH IS SHROUDED BY NUMEROUS LAYERS OF CLOSED PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE
trainval/iE7YRHxwoDs/50003 I NEVER WORKED HARDER ON ANYTHING NEVER BEEN CHALLENGED TO THIS DEGREE
trainval/iE7YRHxwoDs/50004 BUT GIVEN WHAT I NOW FEEL CAPABLE OF DOING I WOULD CERTAINLY DO IT AGAIN
trainval/iE7YRHxwoDs/50005 TO ANYONE CONSIDERING NAND2TETRIS IT'S A TOUGH JOURNEY BUT YOU'LL BE PROFOUNDLY CHANGED
trainval/iE7YRHxwoDs/50006 SO DAN DEMONSTRATES THE MANY SELF LEARNERS WHO TAKE THIS
trainval/iE7YRHxwoDs/50007 THEY HAVE A TREMENDOUS PASSION TO LEARN
trainval/iE7YRHxwoDs/50008 AND YET WE DON'T TOLERATE MISTAKES AND WE WORSHIP GRADES
trainval/iE7YRHxwoDs/50009 4 WHICH IS STAMPED ON YOUR FOREHEAD AND SUMS UP WHO YOU ARE
trainval/iE7YRHxwoDs/50010 WE DON'T REPLACE TEACHERS BY THE WAY
trainval/IeblJdB2SVo/50001 IN FACT CHECK IT OUT FOR YOURSELF
trainval/IeblJdB2SVo/50002 BUT NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRIED MY MIND KEPT WANDERING OFF
trainval/IeblJdB2SVo/50003 AND AT THIS POINT I REALLY STARTED TO JUDGE MYSELF
trainval/IeblJdB2SVo/50004 YOU'RE TERRIBLE AT THIS
trainval/IeblJdB2SVo/50005 AND THEN NOT ONLY WAS I JUDGING MYSELF I STARTED JUDGING EVERYONE EVEN THE MONKS
trainval/IeblJdB2SVo/50006 WHY ARE THEY JUST SITTING HERE
trainval/IeblJdB2SVo/50007 FOR EXAMPLE IN THE FAMOUS STUDY OF LONDON TAXI DRIVERS THE VISUAL SPATIAL MAPPING PART OF THE BRAIN IS
trainval/IeblJdB2SVo/50008 IT'S GOOD FOR US
trainval/IeblJdB2SVo/50009 ALMOST ALL THE PEOPLE WE WERE WORKING WITH REGARDLESS OF THEIR AGE THEIR GENDER THEIR BACKGROUND WERE TALKING
trainval/IeblJdB2SVo/50010 I DON'T WANT TO GET BETTER
trainval/IeblJdB2SVo/50011 I LOVE YOU SHAUNA
trainval/IeblJdB2SVo/50012 I LOVE YOU SHAUNA
trainval/iEySxTbcr2A/50001 I COME FROM A FAMILY THAT DOESN'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY
trainval/iEySxTbcr2A/50002 IF YOU HAD LOOKED AT MY LIFE WHEN I WAS 14 YEARS OLD AND SAID WELL WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THIS KID
trainval/iEySxTbcr2A/50003 THESE THINGS ARE ALL IMPORTANT
trainval/iEySxTbcr2A/50004 I DON'T MEAN TO DISCOUNT THESE STRUCTURAL BARRIERS
trainval/iEySxTbcr2A/50005 YOU SEE IT AS SOMETHING THAT'S ACTIVELY CONSPIRING WHERE PEOPLE WITH POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL POWER ARE WORKING AGAINST
trainval/iEySxTbcr2A/50006 BUT I USED MY POWERS OF DEDUCTION AND RECOGNIZED THAT CHARDONNAY AND SAUVIGNON BLANC WERE TWO SEPARATE TYPES OF WHITE WINE
trainval/iEySxTbcr2A/50007 AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT THE CASE THAT THERE WAS A LIBERAL BOX TO CHECK ON THE APPLICATION BUT IT
trainval/iEySxTbcr2A/50008 I DIDN'T KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THAT YOU HAD TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL TO BE A LAWYER
trainval/iEySxTbcr2A/50009 I REMEMBER I LEARNED THIS WHEN I GOT THE FINANCIAL AID LETTER FROM YALE FOR MYSELF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN
trainval/iEySxTbcr2A/50010 ECONOMISTS CALL THE VALUE THAT WE GAIN FROM OUR INFORMAL NETWORKS FROM OUR FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES
trainval/iEySxTbcr2A/50011 THE SOCIAL CAPITAL THAT I HAD WASN'T BUILT FOR 21ST CENTURY AMERICA AND IT SHOWED
trainval/iEySxTbcr2A/50012 IF YOU'RE A LOW INCOME KID ALMOST HALF OF YOU FACE MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF CHILDHOOD TRAUMA
trainval/iEySxTbcr2A/50013 THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED PROBLEM
trainval/iEySxTbcr2A/50014 THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT ISSUE
trainval/iEySxTbcr2A/50015 THESE ARE ALL INSTANCES OF CHILDHOOD TRAUMA AND THEY'RE PRETTY COMMONPLACE IN MY FAMILY
trainval/iEySxTbcr2A/50016 WELL ONE THING THAT HAPPENED IS THAT MY GRANDPARENTS THE SAME GRANDPARENTS OF SETTING SOMEONE ON FIRE FAME THEY REALLY SHAPED UP
trainval/iEySxTbcr2A/50017 SHE RECOGNIZED THE MESSAGE THAT MY COMMUNITY HAD FOR ME THAT MY CHOICES DIDN'T MATTER THAT THE DECK WAS
trainval/iEySxTbcr2A/50018 YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT TO
trainval/iEySxTbcr2A/50019 SO WE THINK OF THE MARINE CORPS AS A MILITARY OUTFIT AND OF COURSE IT IS BUT FOR ME THE US MARINE CORPS WAS A FOUR YEAR CRASH
trainval/iEySxTbcr2A/50020 IT TAUGHT ME HOW TO MAKE A BED HOW TO DO LAUNDRY HOW TO WAKE UP EARLY HOW TO MANAGE MY FINANCES
trainval/iEySxTbcr2A/50021 9 PERCENT AND I WAS READY TO SIGN ON THE DOTTED LINE
trainval/iEySxTbcr2A/50022 NOW I DON'T HAVE ALL OF THE ANSWERS
trainval/iF4s75ZPano/50001 THE GUARDS SAID NO
trainval/iF4s75ZPano/50002 YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SEE THEM BECAUSE LAWYER'S VISITING HOURS IN IMMIGRATION DETENTION ARE 9 TO 17
trainval/iF4s75ZPano/50003 AND WITH MORE WIT THAN PREPARATION I SAID WELL DO YOU THINK IT APPROPRIATE TO KNOW ABOUT THESE MATTERS AND REMAIN SILENT
trainval/iF4s75ZPano/50004 STAND UP FOR JUSTICE AND NEVER EVER GIVE UP
trainval/iF4s75ZPano/50006 THEY FLED IRAN IN TERRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES ONE NIGHT
trainval/iF5SaDJOr6U/50001 AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT WHEN YOU COMBINED THE VIRTUAL LABORATORIES WITH TEACHER LED COACHING AND
trainval/IFF9iSgOO7w/50001 SO I GOT ALL OF THESE STORIES FROM HIM
trainval/IFF9iSgOO7w/50003 WE'RE COMING DOWN TAKING A CHANCE ON DOING SOMETHING IN TWO WEEKS
trainval/IfG7WVSbN6Y/50001 THERE'S A STRANGER AMONG US
trainval/IfG7WVSbN6Y/50002 AND SO WE STEP OFF THE PLANE
trainval/IfG7WVSbN6Y/50003 YET YOU COME BACK AND EVERYBODY'S SAYING YOU'RE A HERO
trainval/IfG7WVSbN6Y/50004 YOU START TO FEEL A CONNECTION
trainval/IfG7WVSbN6Y/50005 YOU START TO FEEL ALIVE
trainval/IfG7WVSbN6Y/50006 WE HAVE PROGRAMS IN PLACE
trainval/IfG7WVSbN6Y/50007 SO THE ORDERS COME FROM THE TOP DOWN
trainval/IfjI0tVUpbc/50001 YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/IfjI0tVUpbc/50002 AND SO THAT'S THE REASON FOR ME SEVERAL YEARS AGO
trainval/IfjI0tVUpbc/50003 I WAS JUST SO TIRED
trainval/IfjI0tVUpbc/50004 WE WOULD RETIRE AND I WOULD GO OFF INTO THE SUNSET MAYBE DO MINISTRY FULL TIME LOVE MY WIFE A LONG TIME
trainval/IfjI0tVUpbc/50006 I HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT
trainval/IfjI0tVUpbc/50007 THAT'S A GREAT ARM PROTECTION
trainval/IfjI0tVUpbc/50009 FORTY YEAR CRIME LOW SO MUCH SO I HAD OTHER COMMANDERS CALL ME HEY MEL WHATCHA DOIN' MAN
trainval/IfjI0tVUpbc/50010 SO I'M VERY EXCITED NOW
trainval/IfjI0tVUpbc/50011 BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SAME GOAL WE ALL WANT PEACE
trainval/IfjI0tVUpbc/50012 WE ALL WANT RESPECT FOR ONE ANOTHER
trainval/IfjI0tVUpbc/50013 WE ALL WANT LOVE
trainval/IfjI0tVUpbc/50014 AND I BELIEVE WE ARE BACK ON THAT ROAD AND I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT IT
trainval/IfqdMoKVIR0/50001 WHETHER IT'S A CAR OR A PHONE PRODUCT DESIGNERS USE PROTOTYPES TO TEST THE
trainval/IfqdMoKVIR0/50002 BUT THOSE FIRST 3D PRINTERS WERE REALLY EXPENSIVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND SO THEY WERE REALLY ONLY
trainval/IfqdMoKVIR0/50003 PARTLY BECAUSE THE PATENTS STARTED TO EXPIRE
trainval/IfqdMoKVIR0/50004 SCHOOLS LIBRARIES MAKER SPACES STUDIOS GARAGES AND WORKSHOPS
trainval/IfqdMoKVIR0/50005 SO THIS IS WHERE I WANNA TELL A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW I'VE BEEN USING 3D PRINTERS
trainval/IfqdMoKVIR0/50006 AND THE PHOTOS I'M SHOWING HERE TODAY ARE SORT OF A MIX OF OUR WORK
trainval/IfqdMoKVIR0/50007 YOU KNOW WHAT I KNOW WHAT THIS SPACE LOOKS AND FEELS LIKE AND I KNOW WHERE I FIT INTO IT
trainval/IfqdMoKVIR0/50008 NOW THERE ARE LOTS OF STORIES LIKE MINE
trainval/IfqdMoKVIR0/50009 3D FORMS ARE REALLY HARD TO REPRESENT ON 2D PIECES OF PAPER OR A 2D COMPUTER SCREEN
trainval/IfqdMoKVIR0/50010 INITIALLY THIS DYNAMIC FELT REALLY FOREIGN TO ME
trainval/IfqdMoKVIR0/50011 WHY WOULD I MAKE MY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND HARD WORK AVAILABLE FOR FREE
trainval/IfqdMoKVIR0/50012 AND AS A DESIGNER DO I DEVALUE MY WORK WHEN I GIVE IT AWAY FOR FREE OR
trainval/IfqdMoKVIR0/50013 AND TOGETHER THEY COLLABORATED ON A 3D PRINTED PROSTHETIC
trainval/IfqdMoKVIR0/50014 WHAT IF I DON'T OWN A 3D PRINTER
trainval/IfqdMoKVIR0/50015 THESE DAYS IT'S ACTUALLY NOT A PROBLEM
trainval/iFTWM7HV2UI/50001 THAT'S WHY YOU SEE IT IN EVERY SUPERMARKET
trainval/iFTWM7HV2UI/50002 I CAN IGNORE THAT
trainval/iFTWM7HV2UI/50003 WE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEY'RE DOING THIS CATEGORIZATION
trainval/iFTWM7HV2UI/50004 THAT'S WHY FACEBOOK WANTS TO COLLECT ALL THE DATA IT CAN ABOUT YOU
trainval/iFTWM7HV2UI/50005 I WAS LIKE COULDN'T PUBLISH WHAT
trainval/iFTWM7HV2UI/50006 THIS ISN'T ABOUT POLITICS
trainval/iFTWM7HV2UI/50008 IT'S AN ALGORITHM PICKING WHAT IT THINKS THAT YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN AND MAYBE NOT FIND ON
trainval/IfzrN2yMBaQ/50001 SHE GOES HOME AND SHE SEES HER MOTHER AND MOTHER GIVES HER A GREAT HUG AND SAYS DEBBIE YOU'RE WONDERFUL YOUR GRANDFATHER WOULD
trainval/IGadg8xHVPI/50001 SUNFISH IS ONE OF THE WORDS FOR BASKING SHARKS
trainval/IGadg8xHVPI/50002 THEY ARE AWESOME CREATURES
trainval/IGadg8xHVPI/50003 NINE AND A HALF THOUSAND KILOMETERS WE NEVER THOUGHT THAT HAPPENED
trainval/IGadg8xHVPI/50006 BUT THEN I AM A SKEPTIC
trainval/IGadg8xHVPI/50008 IT BECAME KNOWN AS SIMON'S SHARK SLIME
trainval/iGHzqmnGH4A/50001 NOW TELL ME WHY DO WE NEED 24 FLAVORS OF RANCH DRESSING
trainval/iGHzqmnGH4A/50002 AND I TAKE THEM HOME IN THEIR FANCY PACKAGING AND I STAND IN FRONT OF THE FULL LENGTH MIRROR
trainval/iGHzqmnGH4A/50003 SO WE WERE WORKING ALL THE TIME
trainval/iGHzqmnGH4A/50004 I GOT QUIET
trainval/iGHzqmnGH4A/50005 I STOPPED BEING THE CEO OF THE COMPANY THAT I COFOUNDED
trainval/iGHzqmnGH4A/50006 I STEPPED OFF BOARDS I ELIMINATED COMMITMENTS
trainval/IgKWPdJWuBQ/50001 SO WE HAD A 100000 SPORTS CAR WHICH WAS THE ROADSTER
trainval/IgKWPdJWuBQ/50002 IT'S MUCH LIKE ON A JET
trainval/IgKWPdJWuBQ/50004 IT WORKS FOR DECADES
trainval/IgKWPdJWuBQ/50005 IT'LL WORK FOR PROBABLY A CENTURY
trainval/IgKWPdJWuBQ/50006 THINGS ALMOST DIDN'T WORK OUT
trainval/IgKWPdJWuBQ/50007 I WORK A LOT
trainval/IgKWPdJWuBQ/50009 PHYSICS IS REALLY FIGURING OUT HOW TO DISCOVER NEW THINGS THAT ARE COUNTERINTUITIVE LIKE QUANTUM MECHANICS
trainval/IHBGLHgIWJM/50001 IT ALLOWS US TO ENGAGE IN REALLY NEW AND INTERESTING WAYS
trainval/IHBGLHgIWJM/50002 THEY MADE IT FRESH
trainval/IHBGLHgIWJM/50003 THEY MADE IT ASPIRATIONAL
trainval/IHBGLHgIWJM/50004 BECAUSE WE GIVE THEM SO MUCH INFORMATION AND THEY ARE ENTITLED TO REALLY SEE HOW
trainval/IHBGLHgIWJM/50005 AND WESTERN EUROPE IS EIGHT PERCENT
trainval/IHBGLHgIWJM/50006 AND SO IT'S RELIABLE REAL DATA THAT'S RIGHT IN MY FACE WHERE I AM SO I CAN FINISH THE
trainval/ihoR9B7pS1Q/50001 IT'S NOT ABOUT SELLING SOAP THERE IS A LARGER PURPOSE OUT THERE
trainval/ihoR9B7pS1Q/50002 TAKE ANOTHER EXAMPLE I WAS WALKING AROUND IN ONE OF OUR VILLAGES IN INDIA
trainval/IhoRGJlSs8M/50001 IT IS BECAUSE OF WHAT IT STANDS FOR
trainval/ihR9SX7dgRo/50001 IT HAS A SYMMETRY SUCH THAT YOU CAN'T INJECTION MOLD IT
trainval/ihR9SX7dgRo/50002 THEY CAN'T ETCH WAFERS THAT WELL
trainval/iHWIZsIBj3Q/50001 I WANTED TO FIND A WAY TO ALSO USE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE TO RECEIVE DATA FROM OUR
trainval/iHWIZsIBj3Q/50002 AND THE ANSWER TO THAT IS YES WE CAN
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50001 HOW DO WE LIVE IT SUCCESSFULLY
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50002 WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE NEW METAPHOR FOR AGING
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50003 AGE AS POTENTIAL
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50004 AND GUESS WHAT
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50005 THIS POTENTIAL IS NOT FOR THE LUCKY FEW
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50006 WE TEND TO SEE COMMONALITIES MORE THAN DIFFERENCES
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50007 AND I GOT SCARED
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50008 I THOUGHT OH MY GOSH
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50009 BUT NOW THAT I AM ACTUALLY SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF MY OWN THIRD ACT I REALIZE I'VE
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50010 YOU REALIZE YOU'RE STILL YOURSELF MAYBE EVEN MORE SO
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50011 PICASSO ONCE SAID IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO BECOME YOUNG
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50012 I DON'T WANT TO ROMANTICIZE AGING
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50013 OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT IT CAN BE A TIME OF FRUITION AND GROWTH
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50014 SOME OF IT IS A MATTER OF LUCK
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50015 ONE THIRD OF IT IN FACT IS GENETIC
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50016 AND THERE ISN'T MUCH WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50017 WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE THESE ADDED YEARS REALLY SUCCESSFUL AND
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50018 NOW LET ME SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE STAIRCASE WHICH MAY SEEM LIKE AN ODD METAPHOR FOR
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50019 ENTROPY MEANS THAT EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD EVERYTHING IS IN A STATE OF DECLINE AND DECAY THE ARCH
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50020 ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO I READ AN ARTICLE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50021 TWO YEARS LATER HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ALS COMMONLY KNOWN AS LOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50022 IT WASTES THE BODY BUT THE MIND REMAINS INTACT
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50023 IN THIS ARTICLE MR
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50024 THAT'S THE METAPHOR THE OLD METAPHOR
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50025 SELINGER WROTE THE FOLLOWING TO DESCRIBE WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HIM
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50026 AS I DIMINISHED I GREW
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50027 NEIL SELINGER TO ME IS THE EMBODIMENT OF MOUNTING THE STAIRCASE IN HIS THIRD ACT
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50028 PERHAPS OUR PARENTS SUFFERED FROM DEPRESSION
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50029 PERHAPS THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO LOVE US BEYOND HOW WE PERFORMED IN THE WORLD
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50030 PERHAPS WE STILL SUFFER FROM A PSYCHIC PAIN A WOUND
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50031 PERHAPS WE FEEL THAT MANY OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS HAVE NOT HAD CLOSURE
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50032 BUT WHO WAS I
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50033 WHO WERE MY GRANDPARENTS
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50034 HOW DID THEY TREAT MY PARENTS
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50035 AND YOU'RE ABLE TO GO BACK AND FORGIVE THEM
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50036 NOW WHILE I WAS WRITING ABOUT THIS I CAME UPON A BOOK CALLED MAN'S SEARCH FOR MEANING BY VIKTOR
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50037 VIKTOR FRANKL WAS A GERMAN PSYCHIATRIST WHO'D SPENT FIVE YEARS IN A NAZI CONCENTRATION CAMP
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50038 AND HE WROTE THAT WHILE HE WAS IN THE CAMP HE COULD TELL SHOULD THEY EVER BE
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50039 WHICH OF THE PEOPLE WOULD BE OK AND WHICH WOULD NOT
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50040 IF HOWEVER WE CAN GO BACK AND ALTER OUR RELATIONSHIP RE
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50041 AND IF WE CAN MAINTAIN THE MORE POSITIVE FEELINGS ABOUT THE PAST THAT BECOMES THE
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50042 IT'S LIKE RESETTING A THERMOSTAT
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50043 IT'S REFLECTING ON THE EXPERIENCES THAT WE'VE HAD THAT MAKES US WISE AND THAT HELPS US
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50044 WOMEN START OFF WHOLE DON'T WE
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50045 I MEAN AS GIRLS WE'RE FEISTY YEAH
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50046 WE HAVE AGENCY
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50047 WE ARE THE SUBJECTS OF OUR OWN LIVES
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50048 BUT VERY OFTEN MANY IF NOT MOST OF US WHEN WE HIT PUBERTY WE START WORRYING ABOUT FITTING IN AND BEING
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50049 AND WE BECOME THE SUBJECTS AND OBJECTS OF OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50050 AND IF WE CAN DO THAT IT WILL NOT JUST BE FOR OURSELVES
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50051 OLDER WOMEN ARE THE LARGEST DEMOGRAPHIC IN THE WORLD
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50052 IF WE CAN GO BACK AND REDEFINE OURSELVES AND BECOME WHOLE THIS WILL
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50053 YOU SEE IF YOU HAVE OVER TIME REACTED NEGATIVELY TO PAST EVENTS AND PEOPLE NEURAL
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50054 AND OVER TIME THESE NEURAL PATHWAYS BECOME HARDWIRED
trainval/IHyR7p6Shn0/50055 THEY BECOME THE NORM EVEN IF IT'S BAD FOR US BECAUSE IT CAUSES US STRESS AND ANXIETY
trainval/iISw251TIgw/50001 A TESSERACT THAT WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH
trainval/iISw251TIgw/50002 BUT ONE OF THE PROFOUND THINGS THAT EINSTEIN SHOWED US IS WHEN YOU HAVE LIGHT
trainval/IjHlyKTSUug/50001 AFTER THE BUILDING WAS RECYCLED
trainval/IjHlyKTSUug/50003 THOSE ARE INVISIBLE
trainval/IjHlyKTSUug/50005 WE CAN MAKE IT BETTER
trainval/IjHlyKTSUug/50006 VERY EXPENSIVE THEY SOLD THEM OUT FOR MONEY THEN CUTTING TREES AGAIN
trainval/IjHlyKTSUug/50007 SO I REMEMBER IT WAS SO DISAPPOINTING
trainval/IjHlyKTSUug/50010 AND THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING PHOTO
trainval/IjHlyKTSUug/50011 HE SAID AS LONG AS YOU BRING YOUR MONEY YOU CAN DO IT
trainval/IjHlyKTSUug/50012 AND I WAS VERY LUCKY
trainval/IjHlyKTSUug/50014 I BROUGHT MY JAPANESE STUDENTS TO WORK WITH THE CHINESE STUDENTS
trainval/IjHlyKTSUug/50015 IN ONE MONTH WE COMPLETED 9 CLASSROOMS OVER 500 SQUARE METERS
trainval/IJmr7MsS8fw/50001 AND TO THAT I SAY NO
trainval/IJmr7MsS8fw/50002 NO I AM NOT
trainval/IJmr7MsS8fw/50003 ARE HIS 4 LEGS PLANTED FIRMLY ON THE GROUND
trainval/IJmr7MsS8fw/50004 UNCLE ED WOULD BE HOME BY 7
trainval/IJmr7MsS8fw/50005 I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT I AM BLOOD RELATED TO THIS MAN
trainval/IJmr7MsS8fw/50006 I HAVE 5 BROTHERS AND 4 SISTERS
trainval/IJmr7MsS8fw/50007 AND MY SISTER WAS DATING AN EX CON
trainval/IJmr7MsS8fw/50008 IN THE FOURTH GRADE WE HAD A POP QUIZ ON A SHORT STORY WE HAD READ TOGETHER AS A CLASS
trainval/IJmr7MsS8fw/50009 THE QUIZ WAS EASY SUPER STRAIGHTFORWARD
trainval/IJmr7MsS8fw/50010 10 QUESTIONS ON A STORY WE'D JUST READ
trainval/IJmr7MsS8fw/50011 IN FACT PRIVACY SCARES ME JUST A LITTLE BIT
trainval/IJmr7MsS8fw/50012 IF I CATCH MYSELF BEING TOO PRIVATE I KNOW IT'S BECAUSE I WANT TO HIDE SOMETHING
trainval/IJmr7MsS8fw/50013 AND BY DOING SO I WAS ABLE TO SEE A CONSTANT IN MY LIFE
trainval/IJmr7MsS8fw/50014 I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN OUTSPOKEN
trainval/IJwlyf7rCtU/50001 WHEN THEY DO IT'S OFTENTIMES IN THE CONTEXT OF A RELATIONSHIP CHARACTERIZED BY
trainval/IJwlyf7rCtU/50002 AN INMATE IS AN INMATE IS AN INMATE NO MATTER WHAT THEY DID OR WHO THEY ARE
trainval/IJwlyf7rCtU/50003 ON THE SURFACE THIS KIND OF CUSTODY APPROACH SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE IF WE TREAT EVERY
trainval/IJwlyf7rCtU/50004 WHAT I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF SLIDES ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE DATA BUT DON'T FREAK OUT
trainval/IJwlyf7rCtU/50005 USUALLY MORE OFTEN THAN NOT HER CHILDREN WILL END UP IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM OR WITH A
trainval/IJwlyf7rCtU/50006 MANY WOMEN DO NOT HAVE THAT KIND OF SOCIAL SUPPORT
trainval/IJwlyf7rCtU/50007 SOME INMATES ARE MORE VULNERABLE THAN OTHERS AND MORE MARGINALIZED
trainval/IJwlyf7rCtU/50008 THEY WEREN'T BLAMING THE CARDS THAT THEY WERE DEALT IN LIFE FOR THEM BEING IN PRISON
trainval/IJwlyf7rCtU/50009 THEY WEREN'T BLAMING THE ZIP CODE THAT THEY WERE BORN INTO
trainval/IJwlyf7rCtU/50010 DO YOU KNOW WHO THEY WERE BLAMING
trainval/IJwlyf7rCtU/50011 THEY HAVE LOTS OF SELF DEFEATING ATTITUDES
trainval/IJwlyf7rCtU/50012 IT ALSO MEANS UNDERSTANDING THAT NOT EVERY WOMAN'S EXPERIENCE IN THIS WORLD IS THE SAME
trainval/IJwlyf7rCtU/50013 IT MEANS TRAINING CORRECTIONAL STAFF ON ADEQUATE WAYS OF KNOWING THAT THEIR PHYSICAL
trainval/iKHTawgyKWQ/50001 I'M NOT INTERESTED IN THEM
trainval/iKHTawgyKWQ/50002 YOU'RE AFRAID TO TRY
trainval/IkJSZGQaeak/50001 THE FIRST IS CALLED THE ORDINARY WORLD
trainval/IkJSZGQaeak/50002 THAT'S A KICKSTARTER FOR THE CHARACTER SOMETHING HAPPENS TO THAT CHARACTER TO MAKE THEM DECIDE WHETHER I'M GOING
trainval/IkJSZGQaeak/50003 AND I REMEMBER LAYING IN BED AND MY MOM CRYING NO NO NO 3
trainval/IkJSZGQaeak/50004 40 IN THE MORNING
trainval/IkJSZGQaeak/50005 WE DON'T WANT TO FIGHT BUT KRISHNA SAYS YOU MUST FIGHT
trainval/IkJSZGQaeak/50006 THEY SEEM TO BE AFTER THE ONE THING THAT WE ALL HAVE THAT WE ALL POSSESS
trainval/IkJSZGQaeak/50007 WE HAVE TO ENGAGE YOU
trainval/IkJSZGQaeak/50008 BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT CHOICES ARE WE MAKING IN OUR LIVES
trainval/IkJSZGQaeak/50009 ARE WE MAKING THE HEROIC CHOICES SO OUR FAMILIES CAN SAY I LOVE YOU MUCH LIKE WE SAY I LOVE THAT
trainval/IkJSZGQaeak/50011 WHAT IS MY PURPOSE IN LIFE
trainval/IkJSZGQaeak/50012 AND FROM THE DIRECTOR'S CHAIR IT MADE ME REALIZE SOMETIMES LIFE IS A BATTLE
trainval/IkJTwfHPv6A/50001 THEN YOU ARE GIVEN A PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION BY YOUR DOCTOR WHICH YOU HAVE TO PURCHASE YOURSELF AND THEN YOU HAVE TO SELF ADMINISTER THE DRUG
trainval/IkJTwfHPv6A/50002 ALL AVAILABLE MEASURES
trainval/IKZCw4xdESQ/50002 AND SO IT'S LONELY IF YOU ARE A WORKING MOM
trainval/IKZCw4xdESQ/50003 SO A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO I JOINED A BUNCO GROUP
trainval/IKZCw4xdESQ/50004 IT'S LIKE YAHTZEE
trainval/IKZCw4xdESQ/50005 THE AVERAGE MODEL IN THIS COUNTRY IS FIVE ELEVEN AND WEIGHS 117 POUNDS
trainval/IKZCw4xdESQ/50006 THE AVERAGE WOMAN IN THIS COUNTRY IS FIVE FOUR AND WEIGHS 140 POUNDS
trainval/IKZCw4xdESQ/50007 THERE WAS A FAMILY IN OUR TOWN THAT I TRULY THOUGHT WAS THE PERFECT FAMILY
trainval/IKZCw4xdESQ/50008 BOTH PARENTS WERE VERY PHYSICALLY ATTRACTIVE
trainval/IKZCw4xdESQ/50009 I WASN'T DOING THE INTERVIEWING MY WRITER WAS AND SO I COULD KEEP CONFIDENTIALITY
trainval/IKZCw4xdESQ/50010 AND ONE OF MY OTHER KIDS WAS JUST ARRESTED FOR SHOPLIFTING
trainval/IKZCw4xdESQ/50011 SO WE'RE NOT PERFECT
trainval/IKZCw4xdESQ/50012 ONE ARE PHYSICAL STRATEGIES
trainval/IKZCw4xdESQ/50013 SO WHEN YOU'RE FEELING BADLY ABOUT YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT PERFECT GO FOR A WALK GO FOR A RUN GO FOR A SWIM GO FOR A WALK WITH A
trainval/IKZCw4xdESQ/50015 MOST OF MY PATIENTS LOOK AT FACEBOOK
trainval/IKZCw4xdESQ/50016 AND THE PROBLEM IS
trainval/IKZCw4xdESQ/50017 THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A PERFECT PERSON
trainval/IL2lb9fmIV8/50001 HERE IS ONE OF HIS MESSAGES
trainval/ilMwoEdqMTs/50001 AND I TOLD THEM ALL AS WELL
trainval/ilMwoEdqMTs/50002 THAT S WHAT I THINK A STORY ACTIVIST IS AND THAT S WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS DOING WHEN THE GIZ HERE IN GERMANY INVITED ME TO
trainval/ilMwoEdqMTs/50003 SO WHAT STORY ARE WE LIVING IN RIGHT NOW
trainval/ilMwoEdqMTs/50004 IT S THE TIME WHEN WE ALL HAVE THAT SENSE
trainval/ilMwoEdqMTs/50005 AND LAST MY TIP FOR YOU IS TO ASK YOURSELF THE QUESTION
trainval/ilMwoEdqMTs/50006 WHAT IS MINE TO DO
trainval/ilMwoEdqMTs/50007 1948 THE COMMUNIST PARTY WAS THERE
trainval/ilMwoEdqMTs/50008 THEY HOLD OUR WISDOM AND OUR EXPERIENCE
trainval/ilMwoEdqMTs/50009 TAKE BACK THE POWER OF YOUR STORY AND THE OTHER SIDE SAYS
trainval/ilMwoEdqMTs/50010 IF YOU RE HUMAN YOU ARE A STORYTELLER SO NOW IS A GOOD TIME TO GET GOOD AT IT
trainval/ilMwoEdqMTs/50011 AND QUESTION WHAT S ALREADY IN THERE
trainval/ilMwoEdqMTs/50012 AND EVEN MORE THAN THAT
trainval/ilMwoEdqMTs/50013 I FEEL COMPELLED TO DO SO
trainval/im03Zni5BJw/50001 I LEARNED THAT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO RISK YOUR LIFE TO GET YOUR LIFE BACK
trainval/imaWSTabxOE/50001 THEY SLIP THE BOOK OUT OF THEIR DESK ONTO THEIR LAP AND THEY READ WHILE THE TEACHER IS TEACHING
trainval/imaWSTabxOE/50002 AND THE TITLE OF THE ARTICLE SAID MIRACLE FIBER
trainval/imaWSTabxOE/50003 AND THE THREE CAPACITIES THAT WE SHOULD DEVELOP IN THEM SHOULD ALIGN WITH THE THREE ESSENTIAL
trainval/imaWSTabxOE/50004 THE SECOND CAPACITY THAT WE SHOULD DEVELOP IN OUR CHILDREN IS A CAPACITY FOR A
trainval/imaWSTabxOE/50005 AND IT IS POSSIBLE TO INTEGRATE ART INTO THE TEACHING OF ALL SUBJECTS
trainval/imaWSTabxOE/50006 THOSE CHILDREN WHO'LL PLAY WITH ANYTHING THEY CAN GET THEIR HANDS ON
trainval/imaWSTabxOE/50007 JUST THE LEFT SIDE OF THEIR BRAIN
trainval/imaWSTabxOE/50008 FOR THEIR SEQUENTIAL THINKING
trainval/imhUmLtlZpw/50001 IT DIVIDED AND IT'S REMAINED DIVIDED EVER SINCE
trainval/imhUmLtlZpw/50002 I MEAN TAKE THE QUESTION OF EAST ASIA
trainval/IMjn62naclM/50001 YOU'VE GONE THROUGH THESE LOOPS
trainval/IMjn62naclM/50002 SO WAIT A MINUTE
trainval/IMjn62naclM/50003 WHY DOES IT WORK
trainval/IMjn62naclM/50004 VERY COUNTER INTUITIVE
trainval/IMjn62naclM/50005 ARGUABLY VEGETARIANS MIGHT EAT THIS
trainval/IMjn62naclM/50006 AND IF YOU DON'T THINK SO GO VISIT THE SEAPORT
trainval/IMjn62naclM/50007 FREE LIKE SIDEWALKS FREE LIKE LIGHTING IN THE STREET PART OF THE PUBLIC REALM
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50001 IT CAN BE A PROCESS OR A WAY OF ORGANIZING
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50002 BUT VERY FEW OF YOU RECOGNIZED ED CATMULL THE FOUNDER AND CEO OF PIXAR ONE OF THE
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50003 COMPUTER GENERATED MOVIES ARE REALLY MAINSTREAM TODAY BUT IT TOOK ED AND HIS COLLEAGUES NEARLY 20 YEARS TO
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50004 IN THE 20 YEARS HENCE THEY'VE PRODUCED 14 MOVIES
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50005 WHEN MANY OF US THINK ABOUT INNOVATION THOUGH WE THINK ABOUT AN EINSTEIN HAVING AN AHA
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50006 BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT'S A MYTH
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50007 LET'S THINK FOR A MINUTE ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE A PIXAR MOVIE
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50008 ON THE CONTRARY IT TAKES ABOUT 250 PEOPLE FOUR TO FIVE YEARS TO MAKE ONE OF THOSE
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50010 THEY DON'T ALL GO THROUGH IN ORDER
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50011 PARTWAY THROUGH ONE PRODUCTION AN ANIMATOR DREW A CHARACTER WITH AN ARCHED EYEBROW THAT SUGGESTED A
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50012 WHEN THE DIRECTOR SAW THAT DRAWING HE THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50013 TWO WEEKS LATER THE DIRECTOR CAME BACK AND SAID LET'S PUT IN THOSE FEW SECONDS OF FILM
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50014 BECAUSE THAT ANIMATOR WAS ALLOWED TO SHARE WHAT WE REFER TO AS HIS SLICE OF GENIUS HE WAS ABLE
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50015 CREATIVE ABRASION IS NOT ABOUT BRAINSTORMING WHERE PEOPLE SUSPEND THEIR JUDGMENT
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50016 THEY ALSO LEARN HOW TO ADVOCATE FOR THEIR POINT OF VIEW
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50017 THEY UNDERSTAND THAT INNOVATION RARELY HAPPENS UNLESS YOU HAVE BOTH DIVERSITY AND
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50018 IT'S ABOUT DISCOVERY DRIVEN LEARNING WHERE YOU ACT AS OPPOSED TO PLAN YOUR WAY TO THE FUTURE
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50019 IT'S ABOUT RUNNING A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS AND NOT A SERIES OF PILOTS
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50020 PILOTS ARE OFTEN ABOUT BEING RIGHT
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50021 WHEN THEY DON'T WORK SOMEONE OR SOMETHING IS TO BLAME
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50022 THE FINAL CAPABILITY IS CREATIVE RESOLUTION
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50023 THIS IS ABOUT DOING DECISION MAKING IN A WAY THAT YOU CAN COMBINE EVEN OPPOSABLE IDEAS TO
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50024 THEY DON'T LET ONE GROUP OR ONE INDIVIDUAL DOMINATE EVEN IF IT'S THE BOSS EVEN IF
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50025 WE ENDED UP WITH PAGES AND PAGES OF FIELD NOTES THAT WE ANALYZED AND LOOKED FOR PATTERNS IN WHAT
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50026 INSTEAD OF CREATING A GROUP TO TACKLE THIS TASK THEY DECIDED TO ALLOW GROUPS TO EMERGE
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50028 SEPARATELY THESE TWO TEAMS WERE ALLOWED TO WORK FULL TIME ON THEIR PARTICULAR APPROACH
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50029 IN ENGINEERING REVIEWS BILL DESCRIBED HIS ROLE AS INJECTING HONESTY INTO THE PROCESS
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50030 AS THE NEED FOR A SOLUTION BECAME MORE URGENT AND AS THE DATA OR THE EVIDENCE BEGAN TO COME
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50031 SO THEY SELECTED THAT ONE
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50032 EARLY IN THAT PROCESS ONE OF THE ENGINEERS HAD GONE TO BILL AND SAID WE'RE ALL TOO BUSY FOR THIS INEFFICIENT
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50033 BUT AS THE PROCESS UNFOLDED HE BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND THE WISDOM OF ALLOWING TALENTED PEOPLE TO PLAY OUT
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50034 HE ADMITTED IF YOU HAD FORCED US TO ALL BE ON ONE TEAM WE MIGHT HAVE FOCUSED ON PROVING WHO WAS RIGHT
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50035 IT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE MASTERED THE CAPABILITIES REQUIRED FOR THAT
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50036 LET ME GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50037 BUT IF I'M TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S TRULY NEW I HAVE NO ANSWERS
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50038 AND THAT EXAMPLE IS THE INFRASTRUCTURE GROUP OF GOOGLE
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50039 BUT IF WE WANT TO BUILD ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAN INNOVATE TIME AND AGAIN WE MUST RECAST OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT LEADERSHIP
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50040 WHAT DO THEY FOCUS THEIR TIME ON
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50041 NOT ON CREATING A VISION
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50042 LET'S PUT IN A POLICY THAT ANYONE NO MATTER WHAT THEIR LEVEL OR ROLE IS ALLOWED TO GIVE NOTES TO THE DIRECTOR ABOUT HOW
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50043 BILL SAID I LEAD A VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50044 THEY WANT TO CO CREATE WITH ME THE FUTURE
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50045 MY JOB IS TO NURTURE THE BOTTOM UP AND NOT LET IT DEGENERATE INTO CHAOS
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50046 HOW DID HE SEE HIS ROLE
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50047 I'M NEVER A DICTATOR OF VIEWPOINTS
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50048 THE HEAD OF THE ENGINEERING GROUP AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE GROUP AT THAT TIME WAS A MAN NAMED BILL COUGHRAN
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50049 IF SOME OF YOU ARE WORRYING NOW THAT YOU DON'T WORK AT A PIXAR OR YOU DON'T WORK AT A GOOGLE I WANT TO TELL YOU THERE'S STILL HOPE
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50050 WE STUDIED A GENERAL COUNSEL IN A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY WHO HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE OUTSIDE LAWYERS
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50051 WHEN WE MET VINEET HIS COMPANY WAS ABOUT IN HIS WORDS TO BECOME IRRELEVANT
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50052 WE WATCHED AS HE TURNED THAT COMPANY INTO A GLOBAL DYNAMO OF IT
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50053 SO THEY BEGAN TO WORK ON THAT
trainval/ImmtTHYU5GQ/50054 THEY STOPPED GIVING ANSWERS THEY STOPPED TRYING TO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS
trainval/ImQrUjlyHUg/50001 NOW THIS MAY SOUND ARROGANT OR EVEN FULL OF HUBRIS
trainval/ImQrUjlyHUg/50002 HOW DO WE KNOW THIS
trainval/ImQrUjlyHUg/50003 AND THAT QUESTION IS WHETHER IN THIS MODERN GLOBALIZED WORLD WE CAN REALLY AFFORD TO HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT
trainval/ImQrUjlyHUg/50004 WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THIS FOXP2 AND NEANDERTHALS IS THAT THEY MAY HAVE HAD FINE MOTOR CONTROL OF THEIR MOUTHS WHO
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50001 OR HOW ABOUT WE KNIT HATS FOR KIDS WITH CANCER
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50002 AND IT WAS FUN IT WAS EXCITING IT WAS AD HOC IT WAS REACTIVE
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50003 IT WAS GOING SO WELL THAT WE SET OUR SIGHTS GLOBALLY
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50004 WE PACKED THEM UP PACKAGED THEM YEAR ON YEAR SENT THEM OUT
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50005 WE GOT SORT OF DOODLED SCRIBBLED CARDS BACK FROM THE STUDENTS IN AFRICA SAYING
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50006 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50008 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50009 THEY ARE ALSO GETTING REALLY SICK WHEN THEY ARRIVE BECAUSE THERE IS NO CLEAN WATER AT THEIR SCHOOL
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50010 WHEN I SAY SCHOOL I ACTUALLY MEAN THEY ARE STUDYING IN CHICKEN COOPS THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE A
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50011 SO WHILE THEY REALLY APPRECIATE THOSE CRAYONS I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP US OUT WITH A
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50012 AND A LOT OF PEOPLE MAYBE YOU ARE THINKING
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50013 AND IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING YOUNG IT WASN'T ABOUT THAT PASSION IT WAS ACTUALLY ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE DIDN'T
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50014 SO AS I THOUGHT THROUGH THAT AND THOUGHT HOW CAN I AVOID THIS FROM EVER HAPPENING AGAIN I GOT INTO AN EVEN MESSIER
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50015 I ENDED UP WORKING ON A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE WHERE THE SMOKING RATES AND SMOKING
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50016 90 OF THE SMOKERS STARTED BEFORE THE AGE OF 18
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50017 SO IT STARTED WITH MY VOLUNTEER GROUP AS IN US FOR THEM LET'S GIVE THEM CRAYONS AND WE
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50018 THIS ACTIVISM BECAME AN US VERSUS THEM
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50019 HOW COULD THEY BE DOING THAT TO OUR GENERATION
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50020 HOW COULD THEY BE SELLING PRODUCTS THAT WERE SO HARMFUL
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50021 WE WENT CITY BY CITY STATE BY STATE RALLYING TO GET SMOKE FREE WORKPLACES TO
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50022 ALL OF THAT STUFF A FEW YEARS AGO
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50023 HOW BUSINESS CAN BE A FORCE FOR GOOD LET'S SAY WAS THE TITLE
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50024 I WAS SITTING NEXT TO A TOBACCO INDUSTRY EXECUTIVE
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50025 WHY DON'T WE COLLECT SOME BOOKS
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50026 I SAT DOWN ON THAT PANEL I SAID IT TO HER I DON'T THINK SHE TOOK IT UP BUT I SAID IT ANYWAY AND FROM
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50027 THEY MIGHT NEED MORE BOOKS IF THEY'VE BEEN DESTROYED BY THE STORM
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50028 MY MUM HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50029 THIS IS A BIGGER PROBLEM THAN JUST US
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50030 SOMETIMES IT IS REALLY GOOD TO TAKE PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR COMFORT ZONE AND REALLY INTRODUCE THEM TO THE KIND OF INDIVIDUALS
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50031 OK I AM GOING TO RUN OFF AND BE AN ENTREPRENEUR
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50032 WE NEED ENTREPRENEURS BUT NOT EVERYONE IS AN ENTREPRENEUR
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50033 THINK ABOUT THE PROBLEM YOU WANT TO SOLVE AND HOW YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO THAT AT SCALE
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50034 THE THIRD OPTION THAT ONE COULD CONSIDER IS GOING INTO A BIG CORPORATE A BIG BANK
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50035 YOU CAN USE THE MARKETS TO INCENTIVIZE GOOD BEHAVIORS AND GOOD OUTCOMES
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50036 AND WE NEED THAT BY PEOPLE WORKING FROM WITHIN AND REALLY LEARNING PARTS OF THE BUSINESS AND SEEING HOW THEY CAN
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50037 I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING ABOUT YOUR JOURNEY
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50038 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/IMTcuU0KLSw/50039 YOU ALSO NEED TO RECOGNIZE IT IS A TOOL AND THAT WE NEED TO USE IT WELL AND IT IS AN ENTRY POINT
trainval/In6iAXTnqEo/50002 THE ONLY EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE WAS IF YOU WERE A HUMAN SACRIFICE A SACRIFICE TO THE GODS
trainval/In6iAXTnqEo/50003 YOU HAD THE HONOR OF DRINKING YOUR FIRST AND ONLY CUP OF COCOA RIGHT BEFORE THEY KILLED YOU
trainval/In6iAXTnqEo/50004 SADLY THESE VERY PROCESSES DESTROY MUCH OF COCOA CURATIVE PROPERTIES AND BECAUSE OF
trainval/In6iAXTnqEo/50005 AND ON THE KUNA ISLANDS CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES ARE ALMOST NON EXISTENT
trainval/In6iAXTnqEo/50006 AND AS A NICE BONUS THESE GUYS ALSO HAVE A MUCH LOWER INCIDENCE OF CANCER AND HEART DISEASE
trainval/In6iAXTnqEo/50008 THAT'S PROBABLY AN UNHEALTHY DOSAGE BUT IT DOES INDICATES THAT COCOA IS A RELATIVELY SAFE
trainval/In6iAXTnqEo/50009 WELL LET US JUST IMAGINE IF WE CAN REDUCE DISEASE BURDEN ON A GLOBAL SCALE BY JUST 1
trainval/In6iAXTnqEo/50010 NOT A HOLY GRAIL NOT SOME KIND OF BREAKTHROUGH BUT JUST 1
trainval/iNgBSj4S5HY/50001 AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE REMOVED THAT SECRECY
trainval/iNgBSj4S5HY/50002 FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO MOVE FORWARD TOWARDS TRANSPARENCY
trainval/iNgBSj4S5HY/50003 IT'S TIME TO MOVE FORWARD
trainval/iNOE0dZpHcY/50002 FINALLY I GOT A FULBRIGHT SHOLARSHIP TO MIT WHICH IS THE REASON I AM STANDING HERE
trainval/iNOE0dZpHcY/50003 SO ME AND MY BUDDY WHO WAS MY SPARRING PARTNER GOT HIRED TO DO SOME SPECIAL WORK AT A ROCK
trainval/iNOE0dZpHcY/50004 BUT YOU KNOW I FOUND OUT LATER THAT EVENING
trainval/iNOE0dZpHcY/50005 FIRST WEEK I WAS THERE I WENT TO SOME PARTY
trainval/iNOE0dZpHcY/50006 THERE WAS A LITTLE GUY WITH WHITE HAIR
trainval/iNOE0dZpHcY/50007 WHEN YOU HAVE THIS TRAUMA IT'S LIKE A SOLDIER WITH POST TRAUMATIC STRESS
trainval/iNOE0dZpHcY/50008 SHE'D TOLD ME BEFORE WHY DON'T YOU TRY THERAPY
trainval/iNOE0dZpHcY/50009 I WAS LIKE FORGET ABOUT IT
trainval/iNPsDky1z94/50001 WE CAN SEE THIS UNIQUE FINGERPRINT
trainval/iNPsDky1z94/50002 WE GET CONFIRMATION THAT INDEED THE GENE IS TURNED ON FOR SOMETHING LIKE PROZAC IN SEROTONERGIC
trainval/iNPsDky1z94/50003 SO IF YOU'RE IN DRUG DISCOVERY FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN GO THROUGH AN ENTIRE LISTING OF WHAT THE GENOME
trainval/iNtNP6LGek8/50001 IS THERE A WAY WE CAN COLLABORATE
trainval/iNtNP6LGek8/50002 THERE'S SOME BIG CHALLENGES AHEAD
trainval/iNtNP6LGek8/50003 OCEANEERING ARE NOW EQUIPPING SOME OF THEIR ROVS WITH 3D CAMERAS AND WHEN THEY AIM THOSE CAMERAS AT DEEP
trainval/InukG97C8wY/50001 AND EVEN THE VERY RICH SO HENRY VIII FOR EXAMPLE RECYCLED HIS CLOTHING AND TAILORED THEM AND CHANGED THEM AS FASHIONS
trainval/InukG97C8wY/50002 AND REMNANTS OF HAT HONOUR STILL EXIST TODAY SO A MAN GOING INTO CHURCH OR ATTENDING A FUNERAL WILL GENERALLY REMOVE HIS HAT
trainval/InukG97C8wY/50003 HOWEVER WE DO STILL FACE SOME UNSPOKEN SOCIETAL CUSTOMS SO THE MALE BUSINESS SUIT WHICH IS
trainval/inxIM1aGvZY/50001 AND ONE OF THE MOST COMMON THINGS I KEEP ON HEARING AND IT GOES OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS THAT WE ARE CLEVER
trainval/inxIM1aGvZY/50002 AS EXAMPLE I HAVE BEEN TOLD TO STAY IN THIS CIRCLE BECAUSE THIS IS THE BEST WAY ALL THE CAMERAS CAN CAPTURE MY ANGLE
trainval/inxIM1aGvZY/50003 IT WILL BE ABLE TO CAPTURE THE MINOR DETAILS GREAT
trainval/inxIM1aGvZY/50004 RIGHT I AM FAILING MATHEMATICS SO SOMEBODY SHOULD PROBABLY FIX THIS QUICKLY
trainval/inxIM1aGvZY/50005 I'D LIKE TO GET THAT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
trainval/inxIM1aGvZY/50006 WE WANT THIS TO BE CORRECT
trainval/inxIM1aGvZY/50007 DON'T EVEN TRY IT
trainval/iOByGJskqks/50001 GREAT MOVIE RIGHT
trainval/iOByGJskqks/50002 WELL I SAW MATTHEW BRODERICK ON THE SCREEN AND SO I THOUGHT SWEET
trainval/iOByGJskqks/50003 I'LL WATCH THIS
trainval/iOByGJskqks/50004 AND FORGIVE ME MATTHEW BRODERICK
trainval/iOByGJskqks/50005 I KNOW YOU'VE DONE OTHER MOVIES BESIDES FERRIS BUELLER BUT THAT'S HOW I REMEMBER YOU
trainval/iOByGJskqks/50006 LOVE AND RESPECT
trainval/iOByGJskqks/50007 THAT'S WHAT THE WHOLE FILM WAS ABOUT
trainval/iOByGJskqks/50008 I'VE EVEN HEARD A POLITICIANS SAY THAT THE GAY LIFESTYLE IS A GREATER THREAT TO CIVILIZATION THAN
trainval/iOByGJskqks/50009 ALL WE DO IS COOK FOR THESE PEOPLE
trainval/iOByGJskqks/50010 THEY EAT TWO THREE FOUR DINNERS A NIGHT
trainval/iOByGJskqks/50011 IT'S A WONDERFUL DAY IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY IT'S A WONDERFUL DAY IN THE GLOBE'S HISTORY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE AN ACTUAL SITTING
trainval/iOByGJskqks/50012 I WAS VERY VERY FRUSTRATED
trainval/iOByGJskqks/50013 I WAS FEELING LEFT OUT LIKE I WASN'T QUITE GAY ENOUGH
trainval/iOByGJskqks/50014 BUT THEN SOMETHING WONDERFUL HAPPENED
trainval/iOByGJskqks/50015 IS THAT WHAT YOU CALL IT TOO
trainval/iOByGJskqks/50016 AND THAT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ME
trainval/IOzdXNXzDqE/50001 WELL YOU KNOW YOU FAKED IT IT'S ALL FALSE IT'S NOT REAL
trainval/IOzdXNXzDqE/50002 AFTER SHE WATCHED IT SHE CALLED HER DAUGHTER UP AND SAID HEY DON'T YOU WANT TO COME OVER AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS
trainval/IOzdXNXzDqE/50003 AND WHY DID SO MANY WANT TO SHARE THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WITH ME
trainval/IOzdXNXzDqE/50004 AND THEN THAT GOT ME THINKING
trainval/IOzdXNXzDqE/50005 I BELIEVE THE YOUTH OF TODAY SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THIS
trainval/iP9QFSlBOyA/50001 POWERED BY FOSSIL FUEL DERIVED ENERGY
trainval/iP9QFSlBOyA/50002 WASTEFUL ABUSIVE AND FOCUSED ON LABOR PRODUCTIVITY
trainval/iP9QFSlBOyA/50003 THIS HAS PAID ALL THE COSTS FOR THE TRANSFORMATION OF INTERFACE
trainval/iP9QFSlBOyA/50004 WHO IS THAT PERSON
trainval/iPrDiPDTzYk/50001 SO THANK YOU FOR THAT
trainval/iPrDiPDTzYk/50002 A TRUE VISIONARY BY THE NAME OF DELIA COHEN INTRODUCED US TO THE TED PHILOSOPHY
trainval/iPrDiPDTzYk/50003 A PHILOSOPHY ROOTED IN THE BELIEF THAT FREELY SHARED AND WORTHY IDEAS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CHANGE LIVES
trainval/iPrDiPDTzYk/50004 A PROJECT OF THIS NATURE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT SOMEONE OF DELIA'S STATURE SPEARHEADING OUR EFFORTS
trainval/iPrDiPDTzYk/50005 HENCE OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLE AND THEME FOR THE DAY
trainval/iq5lXSj6Prg/50001 SO THE MONEY IS JUST A TOOL
trainval/iq5lXSj6Prg/50002 YOU HAD TO DO THAT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PUSH DOWN SALARIES AS MUCH AS THEY DID
trainval/iq5lXSj6Prg/50003 SO ALL OF A SUDDEN BANKS COULD LEND AS MUCH AS THEY WANTED THEY COULD HAVE AS HIGH
trainval/iq5lXSj6Prg/50004 SO THAT WAS A PROBLEM
trainval/iq5lXSj6Prg/50005 BUT THEN WHAT CAME IN
trainval/iq5lXSj6Prg/50006 REMEMBER THE SECOND STRATEGY FINANCIALIZATION
trainval/IQDrStvBt9s/50001 THERE'S PROBABLY A BREAKTHRU COMING HERE
trainval/iQsnObyii4Q/50001 OF COURSE ARCHITECTURE IS ABOUT FUNCTION BUT I WANT TO REMEMBER A REWRITING OF THIS PHRASE BY BERNARD TSCHUMI
trainval/iQsnObyii4Q/50002 SO WE STOPPED WORK FOR A WHILE AND SAT DOWN AND CUT 10000 LITTLE STICKS AND GLUED THEM ONTO A MODEL
trainval/iQsnObyii4Q/50003 AND I THINK THAT COULD BE ONE OF ITS PRIMARY MEANINGS THAT WE BELIEVE IN
trainval/iQsnObyii4Q/50004 BUT OF COURSE THERE'S ANOTHER STORY TO THIS BUILDING
trainval/iQsnObyii4Q/50005 AND THE DETAILED QUALITY OF EVERYTHING WE DESIGNED WAS ABOUT ANIMATING THE SPACE AND GIVING THE SPACE TO THE
trainval/ir0B0pnfzY0/50001 I WAS HANDING UP FOOD TO THE HOMELESS IN DETROIT
trainval/IRhl1lr0nJg/50001 IT BECAME MUCH MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO HER NOT ONLY TO HER BUT ALSO TO HER BELOVED
trainval/IRhl1lr0nJg/50002 BEFORE EVEN WHEN SHE WAS ONLY VISUALLY IMPAIRED SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO TALK TO ANYBODY
trainval/iRRw3oD1WS4/50001 AND YOU'LL CLOSE THE SALE
trainval/iRRw3oD1WS4/50002 OR IT JUST FEELS WEIRD TO YOU WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IT
trainval/iRsCUJxIrVM/50001 I WANTED TO DOCUMENT ON FILM THE 2008 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS
trainval/iRsCUJxIrVM/50002 NOW IN 1957 GHANA WAS THE FIRST SUB SAHARAN COUNTRY TO GAIN ITS INDEPENDENCE
trainval/iRsCUJxIrVM/50003 AND THEY HAD TRAVELED FROM NEAR THEY HAD TRAVELED FROM FAR BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD
trainval/iRsCUJxIrVM/50004 AND I ASKED ONE OF THE VOTERS I SAID WHOM ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE FOR
trainval/iRsCUJxIrVM/50005 AND HE SAID I'M SORRY I CAN'T TELL YOU
trainval/iRsCUJxIrVM/50006 WE WITNESSED THE ERUPTION OF VIOLENCE IN THE STREETS
trainval/iRsCUJxIrVM/50007 I MEAN AT THE ABSOLUTE TIME FOR THE ABSOLUTE NEED OF DEMOCRACY THEY DID NOT ABUSE THEIR POWER
trainval/iRSjlgWE9GQ/50002 HAVE A SHOWER AND WE'LL HAVE DINNER THE CHILD WILL REMEMBER THAT WHATEVER HE OR SHE DID
trainval/iRSjlgWE9GQ/50003 THAT WILL BE COMMITED TO MEMORIES
trainval/iRSjlgWE9GQ/50004 LET ME TELL YOU
trainval/iRSjlgWE9GQ/50005 HOW MANY CREATURES DO YOU HAVE INSIDE
trainval/iRSjlgWE9GQ/50006 BUT WE CAN DO IT IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS
trainval/iRSjlgWE9GQ/50007 I COLLECT SCIENTIFIC PAPERS ON LISTENING
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50001 THEY LOOK LIKE THUMBS COMING RIGHT AT YOU
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50002 AND HE SAYS BITE EM
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50003 IT'S WHAT OUR NETWORK DOES IT'S WHAT DIRTY JOBS IS
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50004 AND I'M UP TO MY NECK IN ANAGNORISES EVERY SINGLE DAY
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50005 GREAT GOT IT
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50006 IT'S IN THE ROCKIES
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50007 I ALWAYS WATCH THE PROCESS DONE THE FIRST TIME BEFORE I TRY IT
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50008 IT WAS IMPRESSIVE
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50009 I'M AN APPRENTICE AND I WORK WITH THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE JOBS IN QUESTION
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50010 THERE'S NO WRITING THERE'S NO SCRIPTING THERE'S NO NONSENSE
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50011 I SAID STOP
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50012 HE SAID WELL THAT'S HOW WE DO IT
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50013 WE'RE ON TWICE A DAY ON THE DISCOVERY WE CAN'T DO THIS
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50014 AND I WAS REMINDED HOW UTTERLY WRONG I AM SO MUCH OF THE TIME
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50015 ALBERT HANDS ME THE KNIFE
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50016 IT'S A COLD WAR REALLY
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50017 THE WAY WE PORTRAY WORKING PEOPLE ON TV IT'S LAUGHABLE
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50019 OH I'M LIVING IN A COMPUTER PROGRAM
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50020 AND I TALK TO HIM
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50021 AS A GROUP THEY'RE THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE I KNOW
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50022 IT'S PROBABLY THE WORST ADVICE I EVER GOT
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50023 I MEAN THAT'S ALL I HEARD GROWING UP
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50024 BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH PROTEIN IN THE STUFF WE DON'T EAT HIS PIGS GROW AT TWICE THE NORMAL SPEED AND HE'S ONE RICH PIG FARMER
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50025 HE'S GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT HE SPENDS HIS DAYS DOING THIS INCREDIBLE SERVICE AND HE SMELLS LIKE HELL BUT GOD BLESS HIM
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50026 HE'S MAKING A GREAT LIVING
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50027 MATT FREUND A DAIRY FARMER IN NEW CANAAN CONNECTICUT WHO WOKE UP ONE DAY AND REALIZED THE CRAP FROM HIS
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50028 I STARTED TO LOOK AT TEAMWORK AND DETERMINATION
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50029 MOST HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENT I'D EVER SEEN AND I WAS BACK WITH A GUY LASHING THE POTS DOWN
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50030 AND HE SAYS OSHA
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50031 OH I'M DEAD
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50032 IT CAN'T BE REPEATED ON ANY FACTORY FLOOR OR ANY CONSTRUCTION SITE
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50034 HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE THEIR BLACKBERRY
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50035 WE'RE PLUGGED IN WE'RE CONNECTED
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50036 GOOD GRIEF NOT TO THIS CROWD
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50037 THAT'S WHAT TV DOES
trainval/IRVdiHu1VCc/50038 MEANWHILE WE'VE GOT TWO TRILLION DOLLARS AT A MINIMUM ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CIVIL ENGINEERS THAT WE NEED TO
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50001 WE COULD DO THE SAME IN CANCER
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50002 SO IF YOU LOOK AT CANCERS IT IS VERY RARE EXTREMELY RARE TO HAVE CANCER IN A CHILD
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50003 AS ONE GETS OLDER
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50004 WHEN ONE IS EXPOSED TO H1N1 YOU TAKE TAMIFLU AND YOU CAN REMARKABLY
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50005 WE'VE ALL MADE A MISTAKE MYSELF INCLUDED BY FOCUSING DOWN BY BEING A REDUCTIONIST
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50006 WE NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50007 PEOPLE GOT UPSET BUT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO GO FORWARD
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50008 AND HE WAS SAYING DOES HE REALLY WANT TO MEET ANOTHER DOCTOR
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50009 WE HAVE DISCRETE DATA ELEMENTS WE DON'T HAVE A TIME FUNCTION ON THEM
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50010 EARLIER IT WAS REFERRED TO THIS DIRECT LIFE DEVICE
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50011 AND I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT FOR THREE HOURS I'M SITTING AT MY DESK AND I'M NOT MOVING AT ALL
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50012 SO WHAT WE DO IN OUR FIELD IS WE CHANGE AND INPUT WE GIVE AGGRESSIVE CHEMOTHERAPY AND WE SAY DID THAT
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50013 ONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL CLINICAL TRIALS IN CANCER CAME OUT IN FEBRUARY IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50014 WELL REMEMBER THAT'S NOT EVEN AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE BUT THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50015 ANOTHER 30 PERCENT WILL RESPOND
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50016 TO GET APPROVAL SO I THINK THERE WERE THREE U
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50017 PATIENTS IN UPSTATE NEW YORK WHO WERE PART OF THE TRIAL
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50018 SO IT CHALLENGED EVERYTHING WE KNEW IN CANCER IS THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO GET A RESPONSE
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50019 THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS THAT YOU PREVENT ANY OF THESE THINGS FROM HAPPENING
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50020 THAT IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE COST EFFECTIVE BEST WAY WE CAN DO THINGS TODAY
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50021 BUT IF ONE IS UNFORTUNATE TO GET A DISEASE YOU'LL GO INTO YOUR DOCTOR'S OFFICE HE OR SHE WILL TAKE A DROP OF BLOOD AND
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50022 THE WAY WE'VE APPROACHED IT IS THE FIELD OF PROTEOMICS AGAIN THIS LOOKING AT THE SYSTEM
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50023 IT'S TAKING A BIG PICTURE
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50024 THE PROBLEM WITH TECHNOLOGIES LIKE THIS IS THAT IF ONE LOOKS AT PROTEINS IN THE BODY THERE ARE 11
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50025 A WHOLE NEW APPROACH INSTEAD OF GIVING HIGH DOSES OF CHEMOTHERAPY BY DIFFERENT
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50026 COME UP WITH NEW IDEAS
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50027 TELL THEM TO ME OR ANYONE ELSE IN OUR FIELD BECAUSE OVER THE LAST 59 YEARS NOTHING HAS CHANGED
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50028 WE NEED A RADICALLY DIFFERENT APPROACH
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50029 SO INSTEAD OF A REDUCTIONIST VIEW WE'RE TAKING A STEP BACK
trainval/IRxgDMSp9Gs/50030 YOU KNOW ANDY GROVE STEPPED DOWN AS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD AT INTEL AND ANDY WAS ONE OF MY MENTORS TOUGH
trainval/IshrD4mjnNU/50001 WITH ONE EMAIL
trainval/IshrD4mjnNU/50003 BUT WHY SHOULD IT BE A REQUIREMENT
trainval/IshrD4mjnNU/50004 IT FELT LIKE FANCY DRESS FOR THE BOYS MEANT SOMETHING FUN MEANT DRESSING UP IN A WHOLE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS
trainval/IshrD4mjnNU/50005 WE HAD TO COME UP WITH A SLUT NAME WHICH THE OLDER STUDENTS ENCOURAGED US TO WRITE ACROSS OUR BREASTS
trainval/IshrD4mjnNU/50006 UPON ARRIVING AT EACH BAR AN OLDER STUDENT WOULD SHOUT OUT A WORD WHICH WAS CODE FOR US TO EITHER FLASH
trainval/IshrD4mjnNU/50007 THE WHOLE THING CULMINATED IN THE GIRLS AND GUYS MEETING UP IN THE STUDENT UNION WHERE WE WERE INFORMED THE OLDER STUDENTS HAD ORGANIZED A
trainval/IshrD4mjnNU/50008 OUR GROUP BUMPED INTO THE MEN'S RUGBY CLUB IN A BAR
trainval/IshrD4mjnNU/50010 IT RUINED MY FRESHERS WEEK AND LEFT ME FEELING ISOLATED AND HUMILIATED
trainval/IshrD4mjnNU/50011 I DIDN'T REALIZE WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO AS WE WERE FACING THE OTHER WAY WHEN THEY SUDDENLY SHOUTED DOWN IT BITCH
trainval/IshrD4mjnNU/50012 A LONG LINE OF GIRLS WAS LINED UP AND THEY HAD TO TAKE THEIR CLOTHES OFF THEY WERE TOLD TO RACE TO STRIP
trainval/IshrD4mjnNU/50013 THERE WAS ALSO A LOT OF EVIDENCE IN WHAT WE WERE HEARING TO SUGGEST THAT THIS KIND OF SEXUAL OBJECTIFICATION CARRIED OVER
trainval/IshrD4mjnNU/50014 SO WHY DOES ALL THIS MATTER
trainval/IshrD4mjnNU/50015 WE'RE HAVING A BIT OF HARMLESS BANTER
trainval/IshrD4mjnNU/50016 I'M AFRAID THESE ATTITUDES THAT WE THOUGHT WERE EBBING AWAY ARE COMING BACK WITH FORCE
trainval/IshrD4mjnNU/50017 AT ANOTHER IT WAS CALLED SHARKING AT ANOTHER IT WAS SIMPLY CALLED FUCK A FRESHER
trainval/IshrD4mjnNU/50018 HE WAS CALLING ME A SLAG A SLUT AND A WHORE
trainval/IshrD4mjnNU/50019 I HAD SOME GREAT SUPPORT FROM MY FAMILY AND SOME GREAT THERAPY
trainval/IshrD4mjnNU/50020 WAS I DRESSED SLUTTILY
trainval/IshrD4mjnNU/50021 WE HAVE TO START NOW
trainval/IshrD4mjnNU/50022 NO MEANS NO
trainval/IshrD4mjnNU/50023 DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S SOMEONE YOU KNOW IF IT'S LATE OR IF YOU'RE DRUNK
trainval/IshrD4mjnNU/50024 SO WHAT CAN YOU DO TO PLAY YOUR PART
trainval/IshrD4mjnNU/50025 WE CAN SPEAK UP ABOUT CONSENT AND TRY TO OFFSET SOME OF THESE NORMALIZED ASSUMPTIONS
trainval/IshrD4mjnNU/50026 SO WE HAVE TO SPEAK UP AND OUR VOICES ARE LOUDEST WHEN WE RAISE THEM TOGETHER
trainval/iSicXZ2tMRM/50002 SO YOU PROBABLY HEARD THAT WE'RE PRETTY MUCH ALL THE SAME IN TERMS OF OUR HUMAN DNA
trainval/iSicXZ2tMRM/50003 AND SO HOW MUCH DO THEY OUTNUMBER US
trainval/iSicXZ2tMRM/50004 WELL IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU THINK OF AS OUR BODIES
trainval/iSicXZ2tMRM/50005 ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN WE DO TOURS OF OUR LAB AT THE BIOFRONTIERS INSTITUTE AND WE EXPLAIN THAT WE
trainval/iSicXZ2tMRM/50006 SO WE'RE JUST AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS DISCOVERY
trainval/ISjk9ni4XWk/50001 WHEN IT COMES TO SUPPLEMENTS SHOULD YOU BE TAKING THEM
trainval/ISjk9ni4XWk/50002 SO THE PREMISE OF BLUE ZONES IF WE CAN FIND THE OPTIMAL LIFESTYLE OF LONGEVITY WE CAN COME UP WITH A
trainval/ISjk9ni4XWk/50003 SO TO MAKE IT TO AGE 100 YOU NOT ONLY HAVE TO HAVE HAD A VERY GOOD LIFESTYLE YOU ALSO HAVE TO HAVE
trainval/ISjk9ni4XWk/50004 DEPRIVE YOUR BRAIN OF OXYGEN FOR JUST A FEW MINUTES THOSE BRAIN CELLS DIE THEY NEVER COME BACK
trainval/ISjk9ni4XWk/50005 PLAY TENNIS TOO HARD ON YOUR KNEES RUIN YOUR CARTILAGE THE CARTILAGE NEVER COMES BACK
trainval/ISjk9ni4XWk/50006 OUR ARTERIES CAN CLOG
trainval/ISjk9ni4XWk/50007 OUR BRAINS CAN GUNK UP WITH PLAQUE AND WE CAN GET ALZHEIMER'S
trainval/ISjk9ni4XWk/50008 THAT'S WHY A 65 YEAR OLD PERSON IS AGING AT A RATE OF ABOUT 125 TIMES
trainval/ISjk9ni4XWk/50009 THERE IS WHAT DOCTOR OZ TELLS US
trainval/ISjk9ni4XWk/50010 AND IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE MAIN ISLAND THIS IS GROUND ZERO FOR WORLD LONGEVITY
trainval/ISjk9ni4XWk/50011 THEY ALSO HAVE A 3000 YEAR OLD ADAGE WHICH I THINK IS THE GREATEST SORT OF DIET SUGGESTION EVER INVENTED
trainval/ISjk9ni4XWk/50013 AND I THINK IT SUPREMELY ILLUSTRATES THE PREMISE OF THIS BLUE ZONE PROJECT
trainval/ISjk9ni4XWk/50014 WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT THEY ALL DO
trainval/ISjk9ni4XWk/50015 AND WE MANAGED TO BOIL IT DOWN TO NINE
trainval/ISjk9ni4XWk/50016 THAT BURNS CALORIES JUST AS MUCH AS GOING ON THE TREADMILL DOES
trainval/ISjk9ni4XWk/50017 WHEN THEY DO DO INTENTIONAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IT'S THE THINGS THEY ENJOY
trainval/ISjk9ni4XWk/50018 BUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT YOUR FRIENDS ARE LONG TERM ADVENTURES AND THEREFORE
trainval/ISjk9ni4XWk/50019 THEY DON'T HAVE ANY CONVENIENCES
trainval/ISjk9ni4XWk/50020 THERE IS NOT A BUTTON TO PUSH TO DO YARD WORK OR HOUSE WORK
trainval/ISjk9ni4XWk/50021 IF THEY WANT TO MIX UP A CAKE THEY'RE DOING IT BY HAND
trainval/iSmdpCvfMg8/50001 LOVE EMBOLDENS THEM TO TRY TO COME UP WITH
trainval/iSmdpCvfMg8/50002 IT GIVES THEM A CHANCE TO MAKE THEIR DREAMS BECOME A REALITY
trainval/iSmdpCvfMg8/50003 YOU WANT MORE INFORMED ELECTORATE AND WHO DOESN'T
trainval/iSmdpCvfMg8/50004 IF YOU DID A ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS TO GET TO THE WHY OF MOST EDUCATORS IT COMES BACK TO A
trainval/iSmdpCvfMg8/50005 SO THAT BEGAN A LIFETIME OF EDUCATOR SERIAL MONOGAMY
trainval/iSpwUpdQdyY/50001 IT WAS QUITE UNUSUAL FOR THEM TO SEE A MAN COME IN WITH A FRIDGE ON A TROLLEY {LG}
trainval/iSpwUpdQdyY/50003 LET ME EXPLAIN
trainval/iSpwUpdQdyY/50004 40 MINUTES INTO THIS JOURNEY I SAW BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD A MAN
trainval/iSpwUpdQdyY/50005 WAS THAT GUY HITCHING WITH A FRIDGE
trainval/iSpwUpdQdyY/50006 I USED TO TELL IT QUITE A LOT WHEN I WAS AT A DINNER PARTY
trainval/iSpwUpdQdyY/50007 I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS PROBABLY LOCAL BAVARIAN BEER
trainval/iSpwUpdQdyY/50008 I HAD A MONTH TO DO IT IN SO I DECIDED TO TAKE A MONTH OFF
trainval/iSpwUpdQdyY/50009 I BOUGHT MYSELF A HALF SIZE FRIDGE ONE THAT WOULD SIT IN SALOON CARS NICE AND EASILY
trainval/iSpwUpdQdyY/50010 IT WAS VERY INTERESTING
trainval/iSpwUpdQdyY/50011 WELL I'M DOING IT TO WIN A BET
trainval/iSpwUpdQdyY/50012 BY THIS POINT I'D BECOME A LITTLE BIT WELL KNOWN WITH THIS JOURNEY
trainval/iSpwUpdQdyY/50013 AND SURFING ON A WAVE SO IT IS POSSIBLE
trainval/iSpwUpdQdyY/50014 BUT WE'VE ALREADY ESTABLISHED THAT THERE WAS NO ECONOMIC REASON FOR ME MAKING THIS JOURNEY
trainval/iSRWMLMBkqk/50001 SOMETIMES THEY KILL PEOPLE
trainval/iSRWMLMBkqk/50002 SOMETIMES THEY CAUSE CONFLICTS
trainval/iSRWMLMBkqk/50003 I'M VERY GRATEFUL BECAUSE I HAD BEEN TAKING GROUPS OF STUDENTS BACK THERE EVER SINCE AND I GET TO GO NEXT WEEK
trainval/iSRWMLMBkqk/50004 WHAT THEY WERE DOING CAUGHT PEOPLE'S ATTENTION
trainval/iSRWMLMBkqk/50005 IT'S EDUCATION AT ITS BEST
trainval/iSRWMLMBkqk/50006 EVERY PART OF A PERSON BODY MIND AND SPIRIT IS NOURISHED
trainval/iSRWMLMBkqk/50007 IT'S CELEBRATES WORK
trainval/ISSupr6ayqw/50001 I FEEL SO FORTUNATE THAT MY FIRST JOB WAS WORKING AT THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART ON A RETROSPECTIVE OF
trainval/ISSupr6ayqw/50002 ONE HELD A HALF EATEN ICE CREAM CONE IN ONE HAND AND ARROWS IN THE LEFT WITH YELLOW FLETCHING
trainval/ISSupr6ayqw/50003 AND THEY PASSED ME AND SMILED BUT THEY SIZED ME UP AS THEY MADE THEIR WAY TO THE TURF
trainval/ISSupr6ayqw/50004 IT'S JACKIE JOYNER KERSEE WHO IN 1984 MISSED TAKING THE GOLD IN THE HEPTATHLON BY ONE
trainval/iTdZn78u6pI/50001 BUT FOR NOW OPEN YOUR EYES
trainval/iTdZn78u6pI/50002 AND I REMEMBER HIS SOFT SKIN AND HIS HAIR AND HIS RED CLOAK
trainval/iTdZn78u6pI/50003 AND NOW I'VE SPENT TWENTY YEARS WORKING IN ART MUSEUMS CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO ENGAGE WITH ONE
trainval/iTdZn78u6pI/50004 AND I'VE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT THE REASONS THAT PEOPLE LOVE TO GO TO ART MUSEUMS
trainval/iTdZn78u6pI/50005 AND I'M REALLY INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH ART MUSEUMS IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY
trainval/iTdZn78u6pI/50006 THEY ARE HOUSED IN THESE INTELLECTUAL SPACES AND IN THESE INCREDIBLE ARCHITECTURAL BUILDINGS
trainval/iTdZn78u6pI/50007 THEY REPRESENT EXPERIENCES THAT MOST OF US CAN ONLY DREAM OF
trainval/iTdZn78u6pI/50008 AND IT BASICALLY SAID THAT PARTICIPATION IN THE ARTS IS DOWN DRAMATICALLY OVER THE LAST
trainval/iTdZn78u6pI/50009 AND ON ONE HAND THAT'S REALLY DISTRESSING
trainval/iTdZn78u6pI/50010 IS IT THE PEOPLE THAT YOU WERE WITH
trainval/iTdZn78u6pI/50011 BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WE KIND OF KNOW WHY
trainval/iTdZn78u6pI/50012 THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SAID THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY AREN'T GOING TO THESE KINDS OF CULTURAL THINGS THEY WOULD OTHERWISE LIKE
trainval/iTdZn78u6pI/50013 BUT THE SOCIAL PART OF NOT BEING WITH ANYBODY IS NOT SOMETHING PEOPLE WANT TO OVERCOME
trainval/iTdZn78u6pI/50014 AND I KNOW YOU'RE PROBABLY SITTING THERE THINKING DANA YOU JUST TOLD ME THAT PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO ART MUSEUMS SO WHAT'S UP
trainval/iTdZn78u6pI/50015 AND WHAT'S UP IS TECHNOLOGY
trainval/iTdZn78u6pI/50016 PEOPLE ARE INTERFACING WITH TECHNOLOGY
trainval/iTdZn78u6pI/50017 THEY ARE DOWNLOADING PODCASTS
trainval/iTdZn78u6pI/50018 THEY ARE PULLING UP GOOGLE ART
trainval/iTdZn78u6pI/50019 AND THEY ARE ENGAGING WITH CULTURE IN A WAY THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE TO THEM IN TERMS OF TIME IN TERMS OF SPACE IN TERMS OF
trainval/iTdZn78u6pI/50020 THE NEA STUDY THAT I INITIALLY TOLD YOU ABOUT ACTUALLY SAID THAT THE MAIN REASON PEOPLE GO TO
trainval/itLUXZnLRn8/50001 I'M OPTIMISTIC WE CAN
trainval/itLUXZnLRn8/50002 AND WE HAVE THE TALENT TO MAKE IT A REALITY
trainval/Itmu78W9cOI/50001 I HAVE AN EXCUSE AS TO WHY MY BASEMENT IS SO HIDEOUS
trainval/Itmu78W9cOI/50002 ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO MY HUSBAND AND I AND OUR KIDS MOVED
trainval/Itmu78W9cOI/50003 I KEEP SAYING WE MOVED BUT ACTUALLY MY HUSBAND WHO'S IN THE ROOM A VERY EXTRAORDINARY MAN BUT
trainval/Itmu78W9cOI/50004 WHAT'S THE GREATER MEANING
trainval/Itmu78W9cOI/50005 EVEN THOUGH ALL THESE VOICES AROUND ME SAID THAT'S NOT REASONABLE
trainval/Itmu78W9cOI/50006 I IGNORED THOSE VOICES AND I MOVED FORWARD
trainval/Itmu78W9cOI/50007 SHE WAS REALLY MY ONLY PARENT
trainval/Itmu78W9cOI/50008 AND WE'D SAY NO
trainval/Itmu78W9cOI/50009 UNTIL SHE WAS REACHING AS WIDE AS SHE COULD REACH
trainval/Itmu78W9cOI/50010 AND THE ANSWER WAS ALWAYS NO
trainval/Itmu78W9cOI/50011 I DID ALL KINDS OF THINGS
trainval/Itmu78W9cOI/50012 I WAS LIVING IN MINNESOTA AT THE TIME I WAS A WAITRESS AND I WAS STANDING IN LINE AT AN
trainval/Itmu78W9cOI/50013 I'D NEVER HEARD OF THIS TRAIL
trainval/Itmu78W9cOI/50014 I READ THE BACK OF THE BOOK I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING
trainval/Itmu78W9cOI/50015 I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL I WAS DOING
trainval/Itmu78W9cOI/50016 I WAS OUT THERE 94 DAYS
trainval/Itmu78W9cOI/50017 AND THAT SUFFERING WAS THE GREATEST THAT I HAD EVER SUFFERED
trainval/Itmu78W9cOI/50018 THAT STRENGTH WAS A VERY HUMBLE THING
trainval/itnoDEL5QjQ/50001 HE FIGURED THIS WAS JUST SOME GUY HAVING A REALLY BAD DAY AND THEY COULD BOTH BENEFIT
trainval/itnoDEL5QjQ/50002 WELL THIS MAN IN THE CAR BEHIND HIM WAS SO TOUCHED THAT HE BOUGHT THE COFFEE FOR THE PERSON BEHIND HIM
trainval/itnoDEL5QjQ/50003 AND IT'S NOT JUST THE RECIPIENT WHO BENEFITS
trainval/itnoDEL5QjQ/50004 SO I CAME UP WITH A PLAN
trainval/itnoDEL5QjQ/50005 FIRST OFF MY TEACHER DIDN'T SCOLD ME SHE WAS KIND
trainval/iU1bhHeCkoU/50001 I WAS YOUNG THEN
trainval/iU1bhHeCkoU/50002 IT WAS ABOUT 25 YEARS AGO
trainval/iU1bhHeCkoU/50003 IT WORRIED ME THAT I WAS BEING ACCUSED OF THIS
trainval/iU1bhHeCkoU/50004 I THOUGHT MAYBE I WAS WRONG MAYBE I'D FORGOTTEN WHAT OBJECTIVITY WAS
trainval/iU1bhHeCkoU/50005 HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THAT
trainval/iU1bhHeCkoU/50006 OBVIOUSLY WHEN THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD WHEN THE MOST POWERFUL PERSON IN THE ENTIRE WORLD WHICH IS THE
trainval/iU1bhHeCkoU/50007 AND IN FACT THE OPPOSITE HAS HAPPENED
trainval/iU1bhHeCkoU/50008 AND THEY'VE CREATED A MASSIVE ECONOMY FOR THEMSELVES AND AN AMAZING AMOUNT OF INCOME
trainval/iU1bhHeCkoU/50009 AND WHAT HAVE WE JUST LEARNED IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS
trainval/iU1bhHeCkoU/50010 THAT ACTUALLY THERE HAS BEEN A MAJOR PROBLEM IN THAT REGARD AND NOW THEY'RE HAVING TO INVESTIGATE IT AND
trainval/iU1bhHeCkoU/50011 IT WORKED IN THE UNITED STATES IT DIDN'T WORK IN FRANCE IT HASN'T WORKED IN GERMANY
trainval/iU1bhHeCkoU/50012 SEND IT OUT THERE
trainval/iU1bhHeCkoU/50014 BUT I THINK IN THIS REGARD THAT SO MUCH OF IT IS ALSO ABOUT TECHNOLOGY THAT THE TECHNOLOGY HAS TO ALSO
trainval/iU1bhHeCkoU/50015 ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST
trainval/iU1bhHeCkoU/50016 SO IT'S PRETTY STRESSFUL RIGHT NOW
trainval/iU1bhHeCkoU/50017 YESTERDAY I HAPPENED TO HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH HIM
trainval/iU1bhHeCkoU/50018 I'M VERY PROUD TO SAY I GOT HIS FIRST INTERNATIONAL INTERVIEW
trainval/iU1bhHeCkoU/50020 IT WAS YESTERDAY
trainval/iU1bhHeCkoU/50021 AND HE SAID I LOVE MY WIFE SHE IS PART OF ME WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR DECADES
trainval/iU1bhHeCkoU/50022 BUT HERE'S WHERE IT REALLY COUNTED WHAT REALLY STUCK WITH ME
trainval/iU1bhHeCkoU/50023 AND I ASKED HIM TO TELL ME ABOUT LOVE
trainval/IU4A4h1ACJs/50001 SO THAT COULD EASILY PROVIDE ME A LIFETIME OF WORK
trainval/IU4A4h1ACJs/50002 WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE ALL OF THIS AND CERTAINLY NOT IN A CLINICAL SETTING
trainval/IU4A4h1ACJs/50003 THEN I MIGHT MOVE TO A PATIENT SAMPLE
trainval/IU4A4h1ACJs/50004 AND SO THIS WAS SORT OF THE PROCESS
trainval/IU4A4h1ACJs/50005 AGAIN MY BACKGROUND IS MOSTLY NEURO SO I WORK A LOT WITH THE BRAIN CANCER DOCS
trainval/IU4A4h1ACJs/50006 I REALLY LOVE MY JOB I LOVE MY RESEARCH AND I JUST WANT TO KEEP DOING IT
trainval/IU4A4h1ACJs/50007 BECAUSE IT ADDS EXTRA STEPS INTO THIS PATH
trainval/IU4A4h1ACJs/50008 WHAT YOU SEE BEHIND YOU IS A SAMPLE FROM A METASTATIC BREAST CANCER PATIENT AND WE'RE
trainval/IU4A4h1ACJs/50009 IN CLOSING I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT LIFE IS NOT FAIR
trainval/iUbfRzxNy20/50001 AND THAT WAS MY FIRST TIME TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH THAT
trainval/iueVZJVEmEs/50001 WHAT WE HAVE IS EXACTLY THE SAME THING THE SAME ACTIVITY BUT ONE OF THEM MAKES YOU FEEL GREAT AND THE
trainval/iueVZJVEmEs/50002 WHAT THEY DON'T SAY IS WELL THE NUMBERS ALL SEEM TO ADD UP BUT BEFORE I PRESENT THIS IDEA I'LL SHOW IT TO SOME REALLY CRAZY PEOPLE TO
trainval/iueVZJVEmEs/50003 IT'S AN INNATE THING CALLED GOAL DILUTION
trainval/iueVZJVEmEs/50004 AYELET FISHBACH HAS WRITTEN A PAPER ABOUT THIS
trainval/iueVZJVEmEs/50005 EVERYBODY ELSE AT THE TIME OF GOOGLE MORE OR LESS WAS TRYING TO BE A PORTAL
trainval/iueVZJVEmEs/50006 IT'S PROBABLY A BIT OF A CRAP TELLY AND A BIT RUBBISH AS A DVD PLAYER
trainval/iueVZJVEmEs/50007 SO WE WALK OUT OF THE SHOPS WITH ONE OF EACH
trainval/iueVZJVEmEs/50008 IT'S NOT AN UNREASONABLE THING TO DO IT'S AN ECONOMICALLY EFFICIENT THING TO DO
trainval/iueVZJVEmEs/50009 AND SO THEY'RE PREDOMINANTLY INTERESTED IN PSYCHOLOGY
trainval/iueVZJVEmEs/50010 I THINK THE DANGER WE HAVE IN TODAY'S WORLD IS WE HAVE THE STUDY OF ECONOMICS CONSIDERS ITSELF TO BE A PRIOR
trainval/iueVZJVEmEs/50011 IN CHINA NOT REALLY UNDERSTANDING THE PRINCIPLE BEHIND THIS THEY APPLIED THE SAME PRINCIPLE TO GREEN TRAFFIC LIGHTS
trainval/iueVZJVEmEs/50012 THE ONLY THING THEY DIDN'T EXPECT IS THEY'RE UNITING EUROPE THROUGH A SHARED MILD HATRED OF THE FRENCH AND GERMANS
trainval/iueVZJVEmEs/50013 THEY DECIDED THIS WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH AND THEY WANTED TO GET IT UP TO 99
trainval/iueVZJVEmEs/50014 IF AT THE SAME TIME YOU'D GONE AND ASKED PEOPLE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF FIRST CLASS MAIL ARRIVES THE NEXT DAY
trainval/iunmpgOnpqM/50001 THEY BOTH ATTENDED BALL STATE TEACHERS COLLEGE IN THE LATE 1950S
trainval/iunmpgOnpqM/50002 WELL HOW CAN I DO THAT
trainval/iunmpgOnpqM/50003 WHAT'S THE EASIEST WAY IN
trainval/iunmpgOnpqM/50004 THE FIRST THING IS TO ASK YOURSELF WHAT BREAKS YOUR HEART
trainval/iunmpgOnpqM/50006 IT'S AN EASY STEP TO START TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS MOVEMENT
trainval/iunmpgOnpqM/50007 AT THE END SHE SAYS
trainval/iunmpgOnpqM/50008 YOU'LL BE TRANSFORMED INTO A BIGGER VERSION OF YOURSELF ONE THAT STRETCHES BACKWARDS THROUGH
trainval/Iv3Ud7Shv9g/50001 AND THEN SHE TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY SYMBOLS FROM THE YORUBA MYTHOLOGY
trainval/Iv3Ud7Shv9g/50002 WHY DON'T YOU DRAW LIKE OTHER PEOPLE
trainval/Iv3Ud7Shv9g/50003 WHY DON'T YOU DRAW LANDSCAPES OR MAYBE YOU DRAW CHAIRS OR FURNITURE OR MAYBE EVEN DRAW
trainval/Iv3Ud7Shv9g/50004 MAMA THAT'S WHAT I CALL MY GRANDMOTHER TOLD ME MANY STORIES ABOUT YORUBA MYTHOLOGY
trainval/Iv3Ud7Shv9g/50005 YOU SEE THE YORUBAS ARE AN ETHNIC GROUP FROM THE SOUTHWESTERN PART OF NIGERIA AND I WAS ALWAYS FASCINATED BY THESE
trainval/Iv3Ud7Shv9g/50006 WOULD YOU LIKE TO PAINT FOR MY MUSIC VIDEO
trainval/Iv3Ud7Shv9g/50007 PEOPLE FEATURED ME IN MAGAZINES INTERVIEWS
trainval/Iv3Ud7Shv9g/50008 PEOPLE STOPPED ME IN THE STREET
trainval/ivfJJh9y1UI/50001 THEY WOULD BE THE KIND OF PERSON THAT I ASPIRE TO BE
trainval/ivfJJh9y1UI/50002 THE WEST HAD CORRUPTED ME WITH DIVERGENT IDEAS AND IF ONLY MY PARENTS HAD NEVER LEFT TAIWAN
trainval/ivfJJh9y1UI/50003 NOW THIS WAS A DREADED QUESTION THAT I GOT ASKED A LOT BY LOCALS WHILE TRAVELING
trainval/ivfJJh9y1UI/50004 THAT IS UNTIL I SHOWED HER THE PHOTOS OF THE SUPERGAYS THAT WE INTERVIEWED IN INDIA
trainval/ivfJJh9y1UI/50005 BUT THEY WERE FIGHTING IT OUT
trainval/ivfJJh9y1UI/50006 JC YES THERE ARE STILL TRAGEDIES THAT HAPPEN ON THE BUMPY ROAD TO EQUALITY
trainval/ivfJJh9y1UI/50007 BUT THERE ARE ALSO STORIES OF HOPE AND COURAGE IN EVERY CORNER OF THE WORLD
trainval/IvtZBUSplr4/50001 AND WHILE WORKING WITH HER I STARTED TO REALIZE THAT SELF COMPASSION OFFERED A LOT OF BENEFITS THAT
trainval/IvtZBUSplr4/50002 LET ME START BY DEFINING WHAT I MEAN BY SELF ESTEEM
trainval/IvtZBUSplr4/50003 WE FEEL LOUSY WE FEEL TERRIBLE ABOUT OURSELVES
trainval/IvtZBUSplr4/50004 THE SON SHOWS HIM THE FAILING MATH GRADE AND THE FATHER SAYS UHH OUCH WOW
trainval/IvtZBUSplr4/50005 I STILL LOVE YOU
trainval/IvtZBUSplr4/50006 IT HAPPENS TO EVERYONE
trainval/IvtZBUSplr4/50007 PEOPLE ARE THINKING WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS KID
trainval/IvtZBUSplr4/50008 WHY IS HE ACTING THIS WAY
trainval/IvtZBUSplr4/50009 TRY TO COMFORT HIM THERE
trainval/ivvKSx4Q6L4/50001 I HAVE TWO REASONS WHY THAT IS
trainval/ivvKSx4Q6L4/50002 BY NO MEANS DID I HAVE MONEY
trainval/ivvKSx4Q6L4/50003 THEY DON'T WANT TO SEEM BORING
trainval/ivvKSx4Q6L4/50004 BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE YOU GET THAT MONEY FIRST
trainval/iW4fCwfw1vg/50001 AND MY MAIN POINT IS THAT THAT STRUCTURE NEEDS TO BE SUFFICIENTLY COMPLEX TO MATCH THE
trainval/iW4fCwfw1vg/50002 BUT WHILE WE'RE ABLE TO USE IT WE'RE NEVER ABLE TO ALTER IT
trainval/iW4fCwfw1vg/50003 WE CAN USE GRAVITY BUT WE CANNOT CHANGE WHAT GRAVITY IS
trainval/iW4fCwfw1vg/50004 AND SINCE WE CANNOT CHANGE WE CANNOT SIMPLIFY AND SINCE WE CANNOT SIMPLIFY THUS
trainval/iW4fCwfw1vg/50005 WHAT CAN WE KNOW
trainval/iW4fCwfw1vg/50006 OF SCIENTIFIC BOOKS PUBLISHED EACH YEAR THAT YOU CAN READ
trainval/iW4fCwfw1vg/50007 THE FACTS WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BREAKFAST YOU HAD THIS MORNING FOR SURE
trainval/iW4fCwfw1vg/50008 THAT'S THE COMPLEXITY CONSEQUENCES PROBLEM
trainval/iW4fCwfw1vg/50009 WHEN WE TRY TO DETERMINE WHEN WE PICK AN OPTION WE TRY TO DETERMINE WHAT THE WORLD WILL BE LIKE
trainval/iW4fCwfw1vg/50010 AND THE LAST POINT IS HUMAN CONDUCT
trainval/iW4fCwfw1vg/50011 YES WE CAN PREDICT HUMAN CONDUCT WITH COMPUTERS
trainval/iW4fCwfw1vg/50013 WELL THERE'S TRUST
trainval/iW4fCwfw1vg/50014 AS LUHMANN ARGUED IF THE WORLD IS TOO COMPLEX FOR YOU THEN HAVE SOME PART OF THE COMPLEXITY
trainval/iW4fCwfw1vg/50015 THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE TYPES AND ONLY ONE IS
trainval/iW4fCwfw1vg/50016 OK I'LL TRUST YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE HIGHER IN THE RANKING
trainval/iW4fCwfw1vg/50017 THAT PERSON NEEDS TO COMMIT HIMSELF TO THE PROBLEM AND THAT MEANS HE GETS INTO
trainval/iW4fCwfw1vg/50018 THEN WE CAN SAY NO IT WASN'T ME WHO DECIDED IT WAS THE MATH
trainval/iW4fCwfw1vg/50019 AND WHAT DO THEY TELL YOU
trainval/iW4fCwfw1vg/50020 I ONLY DID THE MATH
trainval/iW4fCwfw1vg/50021 AND THAT'S NOT THE FUTURE WE ARE TRYING TO HAVE
trainval/iW4fCwfw1vg/50023 THEY TOO WERE PRACTICING THE CULT OF THE FIGURES
trainval/iW4fCwfw1vg/50024 THEY CLAIM THAT IT COULD ALL BE SOLVED BY THRESHOLD AN UPPER LIMIT A NUMBER SAYING
trainval/iW4fCwfw1vg/50025 THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT CONSEQUENCES
trainval/iW4fCwfw1vg/50026 WHAT WERE THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE FIRST 200000
trainval/iWaZEXBbQL0/50001 A LOT OF CHANGE IS GRADUAL
trainval/iWaZEXBbQL0/50002 YOU CAN SEE THE GREAT CHINESE FAMINE
trainval/iWaZEXBbQL0/50003 WE WORRY ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE THERE ARE
trainval/iWaZEXBbQL0/50004 WE WORRY ABOUT HOW YOU CAN GET AWAY FROM PEOPLE
trainval/iWHq2mSHwhw/50001 IF WE TAUGHT DOCTORS HOW NOT TO USE ANTIBIOTICS AS MUCH IF WE TAUGHT PATIENTS HOW NOT TO DEMAND ANTIBIOTICS PERHAPS
trainval/iWHq2mSHwhw/50002 THIS IS WHAT ECONOMISTS MIGHT CALL A PROBLEM OF THE COMMONS AND THE PROBLEM OF THE COMMONS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE FACE IN THE CASE OF
trainval/iWHq2mSHwhw/50003 NOW THIS IS CLEARLY NOT A GAME THAT CAN BE SUSTAINED OR ONE THAT WE CAN WIN BY SIMPLY INNOVATING TO STAY AHEAD
trainval/iWHq2mSHwhw/50004 WE'VE GOT TO SLOW THE PACE OF COEVOLUTION DOWN AND THERE ARE IDEAS THAT WE CAN BORROW FROM
trainval/iWHq2mSHwhw/50005 BUT WHAT IS THAT REALLY TELLING US
trainval/iWHq2mSHwhw/50006 BUT THERE ARE CHALLENGES HERE
trainval/iWHq2mSHwhw/50007 WE DON'T WANT TO JUST THROW MONEY AT A PROBLEM
trainval/iWHq2mSHwhw/50008 WHAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO IS INVEST IN NEW ANTIBIOTICS IN WAYS THAT ACTUALLY
trainval/iWHq2mSHwhw/50009 AN OPTION IS TO GO THROUGH THAT RETHINKING AND CAREFULLY CONSIDER INCENTIVES TO CHANGE HOW WE DO
trainval/IWjzT2l5C34/50001 THEY ARE MADE FOR EVERYBODY SO IT'S NOT ALLOWED THAT ANY INSTITUTION DOESN'T RESPECT THE RULES
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50001 I SAW DEAD PEOPLE
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50002 IN FACT HE INVITED ME TO EXPLAIN MYSELF
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50004 I COULD'VE EXPLAINED I COULD'VE NEGOTIATED
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50005 I DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50006 THAT'S ONE VERSION
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50007 I WAS ACTUALLY A MARKETING MANAGER FOR A FORTUNE 500 COMPANY
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50008 WHY IS THAT
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50009 SO SHE HAD ALL OF US COME TO THE FRONT OF THE CLASSROOM AND SHE BOUGHT ALL OF US GIFTS AND STACKED THEM IN THE CORNER
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50010 SO THIS IS WHERE I WENT ONLINE AND LOOKED FOR HELP
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50011 I CAME UP WITH A BUNCH OF PSYCHOLOGY ARTICLES ABOUT WHERE THE FEAR AND PAIN ARE COMING FROM
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50012 AND HE SAID WELL OK I'LL TELL MY MANAGER ABOUT IT AND MAYBE WE'LL DO IT BUT SORRY WE CAN'T DO THIS TODAY
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50014 THESE PEOPLE DID NOT LET REJECTION DEFINE THEM
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50015 IT HAS BOTHERED ME MY WHOLE LIFE BECAUSE I WAS RUNNING AWAY FROM IT
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50016 THEN I STARTED EMBRACING IT
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50017 AND THEN DAY THREE
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50018 I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE IT
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50019 WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO DO WAS LEARN AND TO CHANGE MYSELF
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50020 BUT BEFORE HE COULD LEAVE I SAID HEY CAN I KNOW WHY
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50021 I DON'T WANT TO WASTE YOUR FLOWER
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50022 IF YOU WANT TO DO THIS GO ACROSS THE STREET AND TALK TO CONNIE
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50023 I WENT ACROSS AND KNOCKED ON CONNIE'S DOOR
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50024 AND SHE WAS SO HAPPY TO SEE ME
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50026 IT'S AS IF HE'S PUTTING ALL THE DOUBT ON THE FLOOR
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50027 SO FOR THE NEXT HOUR I WAS THE STARBUCKS GREETER
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50028 AND BECAUSE I MENTIONED IS THAT WEIRD
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50029 THAT MEANS I WASN'T WEIRD
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50030 PEOPLE WERE MORE LIKELY TO SAY YES TO ME
trainval/iwlSPe0FbSg/50031 AND THEN I LEARNED I COULD FULFILL MY LIFE DREAM
trainval/IwWuLSwSMvI/50001 IN GOVERNMENT WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE A SENSE OF URGENCY AND WE AS CUSTOMERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO
trainval/IXBalykzauE/50001 FOR ME THE BELT BUCKLE IS A MOTTO
trainval/IXBalykzauE/50002 AND THEY ARE RIGHT NEXT TO YOU
trainval/IXBalykzauE/50003 AND YOU ARE INTERACTING WITH THEM
trainval/IXBalykzauE/50004 AND 99000 PEOPLE DIE EVERY YEAR BECAUSE OF HOSPITAL BASED INFECTIONS
trainval/IXBalykzauE/50005 I MEAN THIS IS PRETTY SIMPLE RIGHT
trainval/IXBalykzauE/50007 SO I HAVE GOT MY METAL ALBUM I HAVE GOT MY 3D ANIMATION AND GRAPHIC DESIGN GOING I HAVE
trainval/IXBalykzauE/50008 AND I THINK IT IS TOUGH
trainval/IXBalykzauE/50009 AND PREPARE WE DID
trainval/IXBalykzauE/50010 WE PREPARED SO HARD
trainval/IXBalykzauE/50011 WE HAD TO GO OUT WE HAD TO GET SOME PERSPECTIVE
trainval/IXBalykzauE/50012 THEY DO NOT HAVE THE TOOLS TO BE SUCCESSFUL
trainval/IXBalykzauE/50013 THIS DOES NOT HAVE TO BE YOUR BELT BUCKLE
trainval/IXBalykzauE/50014 FIND ONE THAT MAKES SENSE FOR WHO YOU ARE
trainval/IXBalykzauE/50015 YOU BITE THE BULLET BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO
trainval/IXBalykzauE/50016 AND I THINK IT IS ON THE OTHER SIDE AS WELL
trainval/IXBalykzauE/50017 LET US TREAT THEM WITH RESPECT
trainval/IXBalykzauE/50018 AND THEN IT BECAME A BUTTON WITH MORE BUTTONS
trainval/iXHil1TPxvA/50001 AND A FRAME IS JUST A WINDOW
trainval/iXHil1TPxvA/50002 I GOT YOU IN A FRAME
trainval/IxjwJ0Y1bxE/50001 AND I REALLY WORKED VERY HARD AND WHEN I FINISHED MY PHD I THOUGHT
trainval/IxjwJ0Y1bxE/50002 THAT'S IT NO MORE MOUSE WORK
trainval/IxjwJ0Y1bxE/50003 FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS HUMANS HAVE BEEN DREAMING TO REACH THE STARS AND YET WE HAVE COME AS
trainval/ixsridS3qVs/50001 HE PRINTS A THOUSAND COPIES
trainval/ixsridS3qVs/50004 THEY SOMETIMES EVEN DO EXPERIMENTS AND LECTURES IN COFFEE HOUSES
trainval/ixsridS3qVs/50005 THE SAME IS POSSIBLE IN SOCIAL MEDIA TODAY
trainval/ixsridS3qVs/50006 LET'S GO AND HAVE A DEMONSTRATION ON SATURDAY
trainval/iyfdWsa1zns/50001 WILL INDIA GO FROM BEING A FAVORED DESTINATION FOR SOFTWARE SERVICES AND BACK OFFICE SERVICES TO A
trainval/iyfdWsa1zns/50002 IT TURNED OUT IN EVERY SINGLE CASE THEY CAME OUT OF THE INDIAN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM
trainval/iyfdWsa1zns/50003 WHEN YOU ASK WHERE ARE THE INDIAN GOOGLES IPODS AND VIAGRAS
trainval/iyfdWsa1zns/50004 THEY WERE WORKING ON TRULY GLOBAL PRODUCTS AND COMPANIES LIKE MICROSOFT GOOGLE ASTRAZENECA
trainval/iyfdWsa1zns/50006 SO MY COAUTHOR PHANISH PURANAM WHO HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF THE SMARTEST PEOPLE I KNOW SAID HE'S GOING TO DO A STUDY
trainval/iyfdWsa1zns/50007 WHAT HE DID WAS HE LOOKED AT THOSE COMPANIES THAT HAD AN R AMP AMP D CENTER IN USA AND IN INDIA
trainval/iyfdWsa1zns/50008 AND A SIMILAR PATENT FILED OUT OF THE SAME COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARY IN INDIA SO HE'S NOW COMPARING THE PATENTS
trainval/iyfdWsa1zns/50009 WITH R AMP AMP D CENTERS IN INDIA OF THE SAME COMPANY TO FIND OUT WHAT IS THE QUALITY OF THE PATENTS FILED OUT OF THE INDIAN CENTERS
trainval/iyfdWsa1zns/50010 R AMP AMP D SUBSIDIARY IS IDENTICAL TO THE NUMBER OF FORWARD CITATIONS OF A PATENT FILED BY AN INDIAN
trainval/iyfdWsa1zns/50011 INDIAN INSTITUTES AND EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS ARE INCAPABLE OF PRODUCING
trainval/iyfdWsa1zns/50012 AND 150000 ARE IN INDIA
trainval/iyfdWsa1zns/50013 IT'S ABOUT HOW DO YOU CREATE A NEW PRODUCT OR DEVELOP A NEW PRODUCT OR MANUFACTURE A NEW PRODUCT BUT NOT A NEW PRODUCT
trainval/IYpovgkaS9Q/50001 AND I DIDN'T CHECK FACEBOOK
trainval/IYpovgkaS9Q/50002 HOW CAN WE KEEP OURSELVES TO OUR PROMISE OF CONSTANTLY REIMAGINING EDUCATION
trainval/IYpovgkaS9Q/50003 AND SO IN MANY WAYS I BELIEVE THAT THE NEXT BIG QUANTUM LEAP IN SCIENCE
trainval/iYwAMccbhYs/50001 THEY HAD BEEN USING NONVIOLENCE FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS BUT HAD GROWN DISENCHANTED SINCE NOBODY
trainval/IyYgvo2ZJtw/50001 SO I STARTED TO WONDER
trainval/IyYgvo2ZJtw/50002 SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
trainval/iZRGUADAu2Q/50001 THE WORLD I LIVE IN IS FULL OF REPORTS AND PAPERS
trainval/iZRGUADAu2Q/50002 THERE ARE FIVE OR TEN PEOPLE WHO READ THE DETAILS OF ALL OF IT
trainval/iZRGUADAu2Q/50003 IT DOESN'T COMMUNICATE TO EVERYBODY AND IT DOESN'T GIVE THAT TANGIBLE SENSE OF WHAT WE CAN REALLY
trainval/iZRGUADAu2Q/50004 THIS IS THE KIND OF NARRATIVE THAT HAS TO BE CHANGED
trainval/iZRGUADAu2Q/50005 SO AS I LOOK AT IT I GO THROUGH THE ELEMENTS OF THE THREAT
trainval/iZRGUADAu2Q/50006 I SEE THINGS LIKE GROUNDWATER OVERDRAFT
trainval/iZRGUADAu2Q/50007 THERE'S TREMENDOUS OVER PUMPING
trainval/iZRGUADAu2Q/50008 MY BACKGROUND IS AS A SCIENTIST
trainval/iZRGUADAu2Q/50009 I FORMED AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION
trainval/iZRGUADAu2Q/50010 SO IT'S INNOVATING
trainval/iZRGUADAu2Q/50011 BUT IT'S ALSO THE SLIGHT SHIFT IN BALANCE AND TELLING THAT STORY
trainval/iZRGUADAu2Q/50012 HOW INSTEAD OF TALKING INDIVIDUALLY WE CAN TALK AS GROUPS
trainval/iZRGUADAu2Q/50013 HOW WE CAN CHOOSE TO HAVE LOCAL AGRICULTURE HOW WE CAN CHOOSE TO HAVE LOCAL WATER MANAGEMENT HOW WE CAN
trainval/j06dz9eDgqY/50001 HERE IS THE THING
trainval/j06dz9eDgqY/50002 REGULAR BLOOD FLOW IS CALLED LAMINAR WHICH MEANS STREAMLINED NO BUMPS STRAIGHT PATH
trainval/J0WQz9qlgZI/50001 EVEN WHEN WE GOT TO THE 1990S AND THE CHINESE WERE BRINGING A SPACE PROGRAM ONLINE THEY HAD THE SAME MENTALITY
trainval/J0WQz9qlgZI/50002 WELL ONCE WE GOT OVER THE IDEA THAT THIS WAS SIMPLY AN ENVIRONMENT TO BE SURVIVED WE STARTED TO SELECT OUR ASTRONAUTS FOR
trainval/J0WQz9qlgZI/50003 AND THAT RIGHT STUFF MEANT VERY VERY FEW PEOPLE COULD GO
trainval/J0WQz9qlgZI/50004 WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IN THIS THIRD AGE OF SPACE FLIGHT IS THAT THE FRONTIER IS OPENING
trainval/J0WQz9qlgZI/50005 I WANTED TO LEAN BACK AND PUSH MY FEET UP UNTIL THEY HIT THE CLOUDS AND JUST KEPT GOING
trainval/J10EaonNV2A/50001 WIMPS ARE AN EXAMPLE FOR THE SO CALLED COLD DARK MATTER WHICH MEANS THAT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF GRAVITY THEY
trainval/J10EaonNV2A/50002 SO WE HAVE TO SURROUND THE XENON BY VARIOUS SHIELDS
trainval/j12BBcKSgEQ/50001 AND ANOTHER ONE POPPED UP
trainval/j3BKOnw9mD8/50002 WE WERE TELLING HIM THAT WE'RE ABLE TO CREATE BATIK PATTERNS USING
trainval/j3BKOnw9mD8/50005 AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE HAPPY WE NEVER LISTEN TO ANYONE WHO SAID THAT BATIK AND TECHNOLOGY SHOULD
trainval/J3pGKt7fESM/50001 A STUDY BY A US NATIONAL NEWSPAPER ESTIMATED THAT IN THE UNITED STATES
trainval/J3pGKt7fESM/50002 ALTHOUGH CERTAIN COUNTRIES STARTED TO IMPLEMENT PERFORMANCE BASED REIMBURSEMENT ANCHORED ON A QUALITY AND
trainval/j3qs0q4RBHY/50003 WHERE'D YOU GO
trainval/j3YjeARuilI/50001 SOME PEOPLE MUST MAKE MORE MONEY SOME OTHERS LESS
trainval/j3YjeARuilI/50002 SOME COMPANIES SUCCEED
trainval/j3YjeARuilI/50003 FOR EXAMPLE IF THAT IS TRUE A BUS WITH 80 PASSENGERS HAS A RIGHT TO 80 TIMES
trainval/j3YjeARuilI/50004 IN THE NEXT 50 YEARS MORE THAN HALF OF THOSE
trainval/j3YjeARuilI/50005 BUT WHAT DO WE DO FIRST
trainval/J45cWdDEbm0/50001 ON THE ONE HAND THEY TEND TO LAMENT THIS INSTRUMENTALIZATION OF AID IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES BUT IN OTHERS
trainval/J45cWdDEbm0/50002 AND SO THERE ARE TWO THINGS I THINK THAT AID ORGANIZATIONS REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT TODAY
trainval/J45cWdDEbm0/50003 WE BELIEVE VERY MUCH VERY STRONGLY THAT IT IS BETTER TO TAKE THE RISK THAT A WOUNDED SOLDIER WHO'S BEEN REPAIRED
trainval/J45cWdDEbm0/50004 RWANDA REALLY WAS EXCEPTIONAL THESE CAMPS
trainval/J45cWdDEbm0/50005 BUT THAT DOES NOT ABSOLVE HUMANITARIAN AID ORGANIZATIONS FROM BEING VERY SERIOUS
trainval/J45cWdDEbm0/50006 AND DOES THE AID DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD
trainval/J45cWdDEbm0/50007 AND I THINK IF AID ORGANIZATIONS RATHER THAN JUST PAYING LIP SERVICE TO SOME OF THE HUMANITARIAN PRINCIPLES AT THE
trainval/J45cWdDEbm0/50008 SINCE THE 9 11 MANY AID ORGANIZATIONS HAVE REJECTED
trainval/J45cWdDEbm0/50009 AND IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME AID ORGANIZATIONS HAVE DONE THIS
trainval/J45cWdDEbm0/50010 SO IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A NEW THING BUT ONE OF THE LESSONS
trainval/J45cWdDEbm0/50011 NO AID ORGANIZATION IS ABLE TO SAY THAT 100 OF THEIR AID CAN GET
trainval/J45cWdDEbm0/50012 FROM THESE 1980S OF TAKING SIDES IN CONFLICT WAS THAT OFTEN THE WARRIORS THAT WE CELEBRATE
trainval/J45cWdDEbm0/50013 IT IS SIMPLY A TOOL THAT AID ORGANIZATIONS NEED TO USE IN ORDER TO GET ACCESS TO PEOPLE MOST IN
trainval/j4LSwZ05laQ/50001 BUT IS IT CREATIVE
trainval/j4LSwZ05laQ/50002 THE DEFINITION OF CREATIVITY THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE GO WITH IS APPROPRIATE NOVELTY
trainval/j4LSwZ05laQ/50003 THIS IS SOMETHING YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT AHEAD OF TIME
trainval/j4LSwZ05laQ/50004 ONE KEY OF CREATIVITY IS TO NOT LOCK ON THAT FIRST IDEA
trainval/j4LSwZ05laQ/50005 BECAUSE THE ACT OF WRITING YOUR IDEA DOWN IS ALREADY A FILTER
trainval/j51HsRILGKI/50001 WHAT WOULD I LEARN FROM SOMEBODY WHO'S BRILLIANT IN ONE WAY
trainval/j51HsRILGKI/50002 SO I THOUGHT I WOULD SHARE WITH YOU
trainval/j51HsRILGKI/50003 I AM HERE FOR A REASON AND I SUSPECT THAT A LOT OF YOU MIGHT BE HERE FOR THE SAME REASON
trainval/j51HsRILGKI/50004 REMEMBER THAT WHEN HE'S JUST SAID WHEN YOU GOT SO MANY DAYS LEFT
trainval/J5jwEyDaRS0/50001 AND ALSO THERE IS NO BOUNDARY BETWEEN CLASSROOMS
trainval/j644FLPS5oE/50001 HOW PEOPLE PERCEIVE US
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50001 JUST WHEN THEY STOP NEEDING OUR HELP TAKING A BATH THEY NEED OUR HELP DEALING WITH CYBERSTALKING OR BULLYING
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50002 AND HERE'S THE WORST NEWS OF ALL
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50003 OUR CHILDREN SENSE WE'RE OUT OF CONTROL
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50004 SO HOW CAN WE CHANGE THIS DYNAMIC
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50005 ELEANOR TAKES CARE OF THEIR FOUR CHILDREN AGES 10 TO 15
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50006 ONE HAS LACROSSE ON THE NEAR SIDE OF TOWN
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50007 ONE HAS ASPERGER SYNDROME
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50008 WE WERE LIVING IN COMPLETE CHAOS ELEANOR SAID
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50009 SO INSTEAD OF HAVING EXECUTIVES ISSUE GRAND PROCLAMATIONS THE TEAM IN EFFECT MANAGES ITSELF
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50010 YOU HAVE CONSTANT FEEDBACK
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50011 YOU HAVE DAILY UPDATE SESSIONS
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50012 AND THESE MEETINGS HAD THIS EFFECT WHILE TAKING UNDER 20 MINUTES
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50013 THEY WERE TOO BLOATED OR TOO OUT OF DATE BY THE TIME THEY WERE DONE
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50014 AS SUTHERLAND TOLD ME WE GOT TO THAT ARTICLE AND SAID THAT'S IT
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50015 THEY DO THINGS IN SMALL CHUNKS
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50016 LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50017 YOU HAD BLOGS POP UP AND SOME MANUALS WERE WRITTEN
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50018 EVEN THE SUTHERLANDS TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD AN AGILE THANKSGIVING WHERE YOU HAD ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE WORKING ON THE FOOD
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50019 THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT SHE SAID
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50020 I TOLD DAVID KEEP YOUR WORK OUT OF MY KITCHEN
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50021 BUT I WAS WRONG
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50022 SO I TURNED TO DAVID SO WHY DOES IT WORK
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50023 HE SAID YOU CAN'T UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF DOING THIS
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50024 HE SAID IN THE WORKPLACE ADULTS LOVE IT
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50025 WITH KIDS IT'S HEAVEN
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50026 EVERYONE THROWS OUT SUGGESTIONS AND THEN WE PICK TWO TO FOCUS ON
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50027 WHAT WORKED WELL THIS WEEK
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50028 JUST WHEN OUR KIDS STOP TEETHING THEY START HAVING TANTRUMS
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50030 WHAT DIDN'T WORK WELL
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50031 WHAT VALUES DO WE MOST UPHOLD
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50032 AND WE ENDED UP WITH 10 STATEMENTS
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50033 WE ARE TRAVELERS NOT TOURISTS
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50034 WE DON'T LIKE DILEMMAS
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50035 AGAIN RESEARCH SHOWS THAT PARENTS SHOULD SPEND LESS TIME WORRYING ABOUT WHAT THEY DO WRONG AND MORE
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50036 THIS FAMILY MISSION STATEMENT IS A GREAT WAY TO IDENTIFY WHAT IT IS THAT YOU DO RIGHT
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50037 A FEW WEEKS LATER WE GOT A CALL FROM THE SCHOOL
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50038 ONE OF OUR DAUGHTERS HAD GOTTEN INTO A SPAT
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50039 DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR PARENTS WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50040 AS THE AUTHOR OF THE STUDY TOLD ME CHILDREN WHO HAVE A SENSE OF THEY'RE PART OF A LARGER NARRATIVE
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50041 SPEND TIME RETELLING THE STORY OF YOUR FAMILY'S POSITIVE MOMENTS AND HOW YOU OVERCAME THE
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50042 I'M PROPOSING THREE PLANKS
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50043 PLANK NUMBER ONE ADAPT ALL THE TIME
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50044 WHEN I BECAME A PARENT I FIGURED YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50046 WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THE AGILE SYSTEM IS YOU BUILD IN A SYSTEM OF CHANGE SO THAT YOU CAN REACT TO WHAT'S HAPPENING TO YOU IN REAL TIME
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50047 IT'S LIKE THEY SAY IN THE INTERNET WORLD IF YOU'RE DOING THE SAME THING TODAY YOU WERE DOING SIX MONTHS AGO YOU'RE DOING THE WRONG THING
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50048 EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT HAVING FAMILY DINNER WITH YOUR CHILDREN IS GOOD FOR THE KIDS
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50049 I'M NOT HOME CAN'T MAKE FAMILY DINNER
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50050 WE'LL HAVE FAMILY BREAKFAST
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50051 WE'LL MEET FOR A BEDTIME SNACK
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50052 AND THE TRUTH IS RECENT RESEARCH BACKS HIM UP
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50053 IT TURNS OUT THERE'S ONLY 10 MINUTES OF PRODUCTIVE TIME IN ANY FAMILY MEAL
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50054 YOU CAN TAKE THAT 10 MINUTES AND MOVE IT TO ANY PART OF THE DAY AND HAVE THE SAME BENEFIT
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50055 THE CONVERSATION WILL GO BETTER
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50056 SO MOVE WHERE YOU SIT
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50057 THE POINT IS THERE ARE ALL THESE NEW IDEAS OUT THERE
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50058 WE'VE GOT TO HOOK THEM UP WITH PARENTS
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50059 IT FELT LIKE WE WERE KIND OF LAYING THESE UNDERGROUND CABLES THAT WOULDN'T LIGHT UP THEIR WORLD FOR MANY YEARS TO COME
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50060 SHE SAID DO I GET ONE FIVE MINUTE OVERREACTION OR CAN I GET 10 30 SECOND
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50061 SPEND THE TIME HOWEVER YOU WANT
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50062 NOW GIVE US A PUNISHMENT
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50063 IF WE GET 15 MINUTES OF OVERREACTION TIME THAT'S THE LIMIT
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50064 EVERY MINUTE ABOVE THAT WE HAVE TO DO ONE PUSHUP
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50065 THERE'S PLENTY OF PARENTAL AUTHORITY GOING ON
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50066 BUT WE'RE GIVING THEM PRACTICE BECOMING INDEPENDENT WHICH OF COURSE IS OUR ULTIMATE GOAL
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50067 JUST AS I WAS LEAVING TO COME HERE TONIGHT ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS STARTED SCREAMING
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50068 MY WIFE COUNTS THEM AMONG HER MOST TREASURED MOMENTS AS A MOM
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50069 CHILDREN WHO PLAN THEIR OWN GOALS SET WEEKLY SCHEDULES EVALUATE THEIR OWN WORK
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50070 I WAS TALKING TO WARREN BUFFETT'S BANKER AND HE WAS CHIDING ME FOR NOT LETTING MY CHILDREN MAKE MISTAKES WITH THEIR ALLOWANCE
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50071 AND I SAID BUT WHAT IF THEY DRIVE INTO A DITCH
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50072 ADAPTABILITY IS FINE BUT WE ALSO NEED BEDROCK
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50073 JIM COLLINS THE AUTHOR OF GOOD TO GREAT TOLD ME THAT SUCCESSFUL HUMAN ORGANIZATIONS OF ANY KIND HAVE TWO THINGS IN COMMON
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50074 SO AGILE IS GREAT FOR STIMULATING PROGRESS BUT I KEPT HEARING TIME AND AGAIN YOU NEED TO PRESERVE THE CORE
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50075 SO HOW DO YOU DO THAT
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50076 SO HE LED US THROUGH THE PROCESS OF CREATING A FAMILY MISSION STATEMENT
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50077 WE HAD A PAJAMA PARTY
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50078 ACTUALLY I BURNED ONE SO I MADE TWO
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50079 MY WIFE BOUGHT A FLIP CHART
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50080 AND WE HAD THIS GREAT CONVERSATION LIKE WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO US
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50081 EACH UNHAPPY FAMILY IS UNHAPPY IN ITS OWN WAY
trainval/J6oMG7u9HGE/50082 I'VE MENTIONED JUST THREE HERE TODAY ADAPT ALL THE TIME EMPOWER THE CHILDREN TELL YOUR
trainval/J6SSCMhcCfQ/50001 NOW WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH CHRONIC PAIN
trainval/J6SSCMhcCfQ/50002 IMAGINE IF YOU WILL THESE TWO IDEAS TOGETHER
trainval/J6SSCMhcCfQ/50003 IMAGINE WHAT YOUR LIFE WOULD BE LIKE IF I WERE TO STROKE IT WITH THIS FEATHER BUT YOUR BRAIN WAS
trainval/J6SSCMhcCfQ/50004 IN FACT IMAGINE SOMETHING EVEN WORSE
trainval/J6SSCMhcCfQ/50005 IMAGINE I WERE TO STROKE YOUR CHILD'S ARM WITH THIS FEATHER AND THEIR BRAIN WAS TELLING THEM THAT THEY WERE
trainval/J6SSCMhcCfQ/50006 THE PAIN HAD SPREAD FROM HER WRIST TO HER HANDS TO HER FINGERTIPS FROM HER WRIST UP TO HER ELBOW
trainval/J6SSCMhcCfQ/50007 AND WHEN YOU TURN THE SWITCH ON THE LIGHT GOES ON
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50001 HOW DOES MACHINE LEARNING WORK
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50002 NO PERSON CAN EVER STUDY A HUNDRED BILLION WEB PAGES
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50003 SO AS A RESULT THE COMPUTER CAN FIND RULES THAT EVEN PEOPLE CAN'T FIND
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50004 AND BACK IN THE DAY I HIRED THE WORLD'S BEST SOFTWARE ENGINEERS TO FIND THE WORLD'S BEST RULES
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50005 THIS IS JUST TRAINED
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50006 WE DRIVE THIS ROAD 20 TIMES WE PUT ALL THIS DATA INTO THE COMPUTER BRAIN
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50007 IT GOES STAGE AFTER STAGE
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50008 IN THE VERY FIRST STAGE IT TAKES THE VISUAL INPUT AND EXTRACTS EDGES AND RODS AND
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50009 AND TO CONVINCE OURSELVES THAT THIS IS THE CASE WE CAPTURED AN
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50010 THE STORY GOES THAT OUR COLLABORATOR WHO IS A WORLD FAMOUS DERMATOLOGIST ONE OF THE THREE BEST APPARENTLY LOOKED AT
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50011 AND THEN HE HAD A SECOND MOMENT WHERE HE SAID WELL LET ME JUST CHECK WITH THE APP
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50012 IT FEELS LIKE THERE'D BE AN INSTANT DEMAND FOR AN APP LIKE THIS RIGHT NOW THAT YOU MIGHT FREAK OUT A LOT OF PEOPLE
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50013 I MEAN SOME PEOPLE HAVE HAD 10 15 20 MELANOMAS REMOVED AND ARE SCARED THAT ONE MIGHT BE
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50014 AND IT TOOK US ONLY TWO ENGINEERS AND THREE MONTHS TO DO THIS
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50015 AND THE REASON IS WE HAVE AN ARMY OF STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATE IN COMPETITIONS
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50016 I'M NOT OBLIGED TO USE ANY OF THOSE
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50017 THE LAST THING I WANT IS FOR MY AI TO HAVE CONSCIOUSNESS
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50018 AND I THINK KASPAROV WAS EXACTLY CORRECT
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50019 IT'S BEEN THE COMBINATION OF HUMAN SMARTS AND MACHINE SMARTS THAT MAKE US STRONGER
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50020 IT'S THE REWRITING OF CODE
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50021 THAT'S WHAT IS ON MY MIND
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50022 NOW HERE COMES LITTLE SEBASTIAN WITH A LITTLE STEAM ENGINE IN HIS POCKET SAYING HEY GUYS LOOK AT THIS
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50023 IT'S GOING TO BE EVEN BETTER IN MY OPINION
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50024 IT'S A VERY SPECIFIC DOMAIN SPECIFIC FUNCTION AND THE SAME IS TRUE FOR OUR CANCER APP
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50025 IT'S BEEN CONTRACT DRAFTING
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50026 THAT'S PHYSICALLY NOT POSSIBLE
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50027 THERE'S NO MATH ISSUE ANYMORE
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50028 AND I THINK WHAT REALLY WILL HAPPEN IS THAT WE CAN BE SUPER CREATIVE
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50029 THAT'S OUR SECRET WEAPON
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50030 IN FACT THE PACE OF INVENTION HAS GONE UP NOT GONE DOWN IN MY OPINION
trainval/J6tgYBMXR6s/50031 WE DON'T HAVE THIS MAGIC IMPLANT IN OUR BRAIN THAT GIVES US THE INFORMATION WE WANT
trainval/J6uL4vDAU3s/50001 I GUESS WHAT WE ALL WANT IS FOR DEMOCRACY TO REALLY SUCCEED
trainval/J6uL4vDAU3s/50002 NOW WHAT GOOD BRANDING DOES IS IT DOES MANAGE TO CONNECT WITH PEOPLE TO TOUCH PEOPLE ON THEIR
trainval/J6uL4vDAU3s/50003 AND OFTEN WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT BRANDS THEY CAN FORGET THAT SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL BRANDS MOST INFLUENTIAL BRANDS
trainval/J6uL4vDAU3s/50004 WE'LL HAVE THAT SUPERMARKET SPECIAL OFFER
trainval/J6uL4vDAU3s/50005 SO IF YOU WANTED TO CREATE A GLOBAL BRAND YOU'D START WITH A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE
trainval/J6uL4vDAU3s/50006 YOU MIGHT GET SOME EXPERTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD
trainval/J6ZzmqDMhi0/50001 THINK ABOUT EPISODES THAT HAPPENED LIVE ON RADIO
trainval/J6ZzmqDMhi0/50002 IT WAS JUST HIM DIRECTLY CONNECTED WITH HIS AUDIENCE AND BUILDING ON THE FEEDBACK AND ENTHUSIASM THAT THEY WERE GIVING
trainval/J6ZzmqDMhi0/50003 YOU COULD TUNE IN TO A SHORT STORY FROM THE NEW YORKER'S FICTION ACCOUNT
trainval/J6ZzmqDMhi0/50004 THESE THREE CHARACTERS BROUGHT AN AUTHENTIC VISION FROM MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES
trainval/J6ZzmqDMhi0/50005 IT WAS ALSO TWITTER AS A PRODUCTION MECHANISM
trainval/J6ZzmqDMhi0/50006 THEY ARE CREATIVE PEOPLE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE BOUNDS OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE IN THIS MEDIUM
trainval/J6ZzmqDMhi0/50007 YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE WEST WING TWITTER IN WHICH YOU HAVE THESE FICTIONAL CHARACTERS THAT ENGAGE WITH THE REAL WORLD
trainval/J6ZzmqDMhi0/50008 IT WAS MAYOR EMANUEL
trainval/J6ZzmqDMhi0/50009 IT GAVE YOU EVERYTHING YOU WANTED FROM RAHM EMANUEL PARTICULARLY IN THE EXPLETIVE
trainval/j7c9b9A2AHc/50001 WE ARE VERY GOOD IN SHIFTING THE BLAME SOMEWHERE ELSE AND RATIONALISING OUR OWN UNSUSTAINABLE
trainval/j7c9b9A2AHc/50002 SO WE FRAME IT AS A PROBLEM OF PRODUCTION
trainval/j7c9b9A2AHc/50003 WHAT IS IT THAT EXPLAINS THIS GAP BETWEEN INTENTIONS AND BEHAVIOR
trainval/j7c9b9A2AHc/50004 YOU MUST IMAGINE A HABIT LIKE AN ICEBERG
trainval/j7c9b9A2AHc/50005 WHAT YOU CANNOT SEE UNDER THE WATER ARE THE VALUES AND BELIEFS THAT DRIVE
trainval/j7c9b9A2AHc/50006 FOR WOMEN THEY USED THE STORY OF EMANCIPATION AND SEXINESS
trainval/j7c9b9A2AHc/50007 WHAT IS THAT STORY ABOUT
trainval/j7c9b9A2AHc/50008 IT'S AN APOCALYPTIC FUTURE
trainval/j7c9b9A2AHc/50009 IT'S A STORY ABOUT THE COLLAPSE OF THE PLANET
trainval/j7c9b9A2AHc/50010 WE DON'T BELIEVE THEM
trainval/j7c9b9A2AHc/50011 SO THESE STORIES ARE NOT CREDIBLE
trainval/j7c9b9A2AHc/50012 THIS STORY IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO BREAK THE POWER OF THE IMMEDIATE HAPPINESS THAT I CAN GET
trainval/j7c9b9A2AHc/50013 AS A JOURNALIST YOUR READERS
trainval/j7RsRnYlz7I/50001 THEY DON'T HAVE TIME TO RELAX
trainval/j7RsRnYlz7I/50002 WOULD WE SEE 544 AIRLINE PILOTS HELD CAPTIVE IN THEIR JUMBO JETS ON A
trainval/j81saupKVpo/50001 NOT ONLY THAT IF INSTEAD OF USING MY HAND WITH THE FINGERS I USE MY HAND CLOSED INTO A FIST THAT MAKES THIS
trainval/j81saupKVpo/50002 THINGS CAN ALWAYS CHANGE
trainval/j81saupKVpo/50003 THE 10 OF HEARTS
trainval/j81saupKVpo/50004 MY ANSWER WAS
trainval/j81saupKVpo/50005 IT WAS A SPADE
trainval/j81saupKVpo/50006 HE SAID IT COULD BE A HIGH SPADE OR A LOW SPADE
trainval/j81saupKVpo/50007 AND MY ANSWER WAS
trainval/j81saupKVpo/50009 I HAVE A PLAYING CARD IN MY HAND
trainval/j81saupKVpo/50010 BUT IT WAS REALLY FAIR
trainval/j81saupKVpo/50011 WHAT IS THE SECOND NUMBER
trainval/j8T3bdqTdp4/50001 AND THAT'S HOW I DISCOVERED MY PURPOSE IN LIFE
trainval/j8T3bdqTdp4/50002 SO BACK TO WHERE IT ALL STARTED OF THIS TALK
trainval/j97WsAz3CDY/50001 UNCOVER WHAT I'D HINT AT IF I COULD
trainval/j97WsAz3CDY/50002 THIS WAS A BRAIN THAT PAID ITS DUES
trainval/J9PgY1mbPgM/50001 THAT'S ONE MILLION ON TOP OF THE PROJECTED THREE MILLION
trainval/J9PgY1mbPgM/50002 I JUST GAVE IT AWAY
trainval/J9PgY1mbPgM/50003 I ALSO REALLY LOVED MATH
trainval/J9PgY1mbPgM/50004 IN FACT WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL MY GEOMETRY TEACHER WOULD ACTUALLY LET ME TEACH CLASS FOR HER IF SHE WAS GOING TO BE GONE
trainval/J9PgY1mbPgM/50005 AND WHAT IF SOMEBODY FINDS OUT THAT I DON'T DESERVE TO BE HERE
trainval/J9PgY1mbPgM/50006 SO THERE'S A TERM FOR THIS AND IT'S CALLED THE IMPOSTOR SYNDROME
trainval/J9PgY1mbPgM/50007 THE ROLE MODEL PIECE IS SO IMPORTANT
trainval/J9SXc9wxByM/50001 STATES CAN ALSO BORROW MORE AND USUALLY AT A LOWER COST WHICH AGAIN HELPS TO INCREASE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE
trainval/J9SXc9wxByM/50002 THE ONLY THING THAT CAN PREVENT PROGRESS IS A FAILURE TO ADMIT THAT LOOKING BEYOND THE CURRENT PARADIGM CAN BE USEFUL
trainval/Ja5UAq09lps/50003 EVERYTHING FROM INFRASTRUCTURE TO OUR WATER SUPPLY EVERYTHING FROM OUR DIET
trainval/Ja5UAq09lps/50004 THESE ARE NOT JUST GLOBAL CHALLENGES BUT INTERCONNECTED URBAN ONES AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE MASSIVELY AMPLIFIED AND
trainval/JaFSfq2Zn7I/50001 NOW THE EXACT AMOUNT OF HOW YOU MAP FROM A CERTAIN INCREASE OF CO2 TO WHAT
trainval/JaFSfq2Zn7I/50002 IT'S AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT FIVE TONS FOR EVERYONE ON THE PLANET
trainval/JaFSfq2Zn7I/50003 IF YOU BURN NATURAL GAS NO
trainval/JaFSfq2Zn7I/50004 IN FACT IF YOU COULD PICK JUST ONE THING TO LOWER THE PRICE OF TO REDUCE POVERTY BY FAR YOU WOULD
trainval/JaFSfq2Zn7I/50005 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO THERE SEEMS LIKE IT MIGHT BE SIMPLE BUT IT'S NOT
trainval/JaFSfq2Zn7I/50006 IS IT A MANHATTAN PROJECT
trainval/JaFSfq2Zn7I/50007 SO LET'S THINK HOW SHOULD WE MEASURE OURSELVES
trainval/JaFSfq2Zn7I/50008 WHAT SHOULD OUR REPORT CARD LOOK LIKE
trainval/JaFSfq2Zn7I/50009 SO IF YOU HAVE VERY {LG}
trainval/JaFSfq2Zn7I/50010 WHERE IS THERE MOST INTEREST IN ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING WITH THIS
trainval/JaFSfq2Zn7I/50011 SO I'M OPTIMISTIC
trainval/JaFSfq2Zn7I/50012 THE FRENCH AND JAPANESE HAVE DONE SOME WORK
trainval/JaFSfq2Zn7I/50013 IN THE NUCLEAR SPACE THERE ARE OTHER INNOVATORS
trainval/JaFSfq2Zn7I/50014 IT SHOULDN'T TAKE AWAY FROM OTHER THINGS
trainval/JaFSfq2Zn7I/50015 YOU MAY NEED HEART SURGERY OR SOMETHING
trainval/jAGgKE82034/50001 FIRST OF ALL WE CAN'T STOP LANGUAGE CHANGING
trainval/jAGgKE82034/50002 AND WORD ORDER IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS
trainval/jAGgKE82034/50003 HOWEVER THERE ARE MANY ASPECTS OF LANGUAGE WHERE WE DO HAVE A CHOICE
trainval/jAGgKE82034/50004 THESE ARE THE VARIABLE ASPECTS
trainval/jAGgKE82034/50005 YOU MIGHT SAY THAT NONSTANDARD LIKE IS ALL OVER THE PLACE
trainval/jAGgKE82034/50006 NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA
trainval/jAGgKE82034/50007 ANNA ON THE OTHER HAND WAS THE MOTHER OF TWO YOUNG CHILDREN
trainval/JaQNy0Ef4YY/50001 ARE YOU READY FOR THE AGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT 2
trainval/JaQNy0Ef4YY/50002 ONCE ROASTED THEY TASTE DIFFERENT
trainval/JaQNy0Ef4YY/50003 LET'S THINK ABOUT THAT FOR 10 SECONDS
trainval/JaQNy0Ef4YY/50004 NOT DAYS NOT WEEKS
trainval/JaQNy0Ef4YY/50005 LIKE SOME OF THE MASS COFFEE PRODUCERS CLAIM
trainval/JaQNy0Ef4YY/50006 I CAN TELL YOU FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AND HOW IT FEELS IN MY BODY AND TESTS ARE DONE FOR MYSELF THERE ARE SO MANY MORE
trainval/JaQNy0Ef4YY/50007 NOW IS THE TIME TO WAKE UP {LG}
trainval/JbuSeMcEF3s/50001 WE EACH HAVE TWO ASPECTS TO OUR FACE
trainval/JbuSeMcEF3s/50002 OH SHOULD I ASK THEM
trainval/JbuSeMcEF3s/50004 THEY MIGHT BE A BIT EXAGGERATED
trainval/JbuSeMcEF3s/50005 WELL YES I DO
trainval/Jc2F3SnawnI/50001 YET THERE IS HOPE
trainval/Jc2F3SnawnI/50002 SOMEBODY HAS TO FEEL HOW YOU FELT
trainval/Jc2F3SnawnI/50003 AND I WANT TO ENGAGE MYSELF IN THE BRIGHT FUTURE FOR MY CHILDREN AND THE CHILDREN OF MY CHILDREN AND I WILL
trainval/Jc2F3SnawnI/50004 AND ONE EVENING I WAS SITTING NEXT TO A VERY NICE GENTLEMAN IN KABUL AND HE ASKED WHAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE
trainval/JC7WnzM2Lsc/50001 IT TOOK YEARS UNTIL I REALLY GOT IT
trainval/JC7WnzM2Lsc/50002 IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF FEELINGS
trainval/JC7WnzM2Lsc/50003 WELL AS IT TURNS OUT I AM IN A GOOD COMPANY
trainval/JC7WnzM2Lsc/50004 ONE STUDENT WAS ASKING
trainval/JC7WnzM2Lsc/50005 I SAW THAT IT WAS NOT ABOUT JUST TRANSMITTING KNOWLEDGE IT WAS ABOUT GIVING A NEW
trainval/JC7WnzM2Lsc/50006 TOGETHER WITH PROF
trainval/JcCQS4YiTb8/50001 WHAT IS THE TIME AND THIS FEELING THIS SPINNING INTO THE INSIDE OF MY STOMACH
trainval/JCI9FBP0Abg/50001 I'M NOT SPEAKING ABOUT ALL THE STUFF YOU KNOW
trainval/JCI9FBP0Abg/50002 THE OLD THINGS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THE NEW ONES
trainval/JCI9FBP0Abg/50003 BUT ANYWAY YOU ESCAPED
trainval/JCI9FBP0Abg/50004 WHAT COULD YOU BUY ON THIS SUM
trainval/JCJ9BMSmqAY/50001 OVER THREE THESE DAYS
trainval/JD4O7ama3o8/50001 I EITHER GET DO YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/JD4O7ama3o8/50002 AND THAT'S NORMAL
trainval/JD4O7ama3o8/50003 SO WHEN MUM NEEDS HELP I'LL SAY
trainval/JD4O7ama3o8/50004 I'LL LAY THE TABLE
trainval/JD4O7ama3o8/50005 AND THEN I GO TO SCHOOL AND I DO TIDY UP TIME AND WHEN A NEW GIRL COMES IN I SHOW HER AROUND
trainval/JD4O7ama3o8/50006 I'M QUITE HAPPY TO DO THAT
trainval/JD4O7ama3o8/50007 AND THE PARENTS HEAR
trainval/JD4O7ama3o8/50008 SUCH A NICE CHILD TO HAVE AROUND
trainval/JD4O7ama3o8/50009 TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT HER FAMILY BACKGROUND THAT WOULD INDICATE WHY SHE MIGHT FEEL COMFORTABLE AROUND TROUBLED PEOPLE
trainval/JD4O7ama3o8/50010 LET'S WORRY ABOUT YOU
trainval/JD4O7ama3o8/50011 YES WE WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO MIGHT WANT TO TAKE MEDICATION ALONGSIDE BUT I'M REALLY INTERESTED
trainval/JD4O7ama3o8/50012 THE PARENT GENERALLY SPEAKING WILL DO ONE OF TWO THINGS
trainval/JD4O7ama3o8/50013 I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY A FEELING
trainval/JD4O7ama3o8/50014 IF YOU'RE BUSY DOING THE WASHING UP AND YOU'RE KIND OF STRESSED AND THEY COME IN AND START GOING MA'AM
trainval/JD4O7ama3o8/50015 I'VE SET YOU UP FOR THIS AND I ACTUALLY NEED TO START GETTING A HANDLE ON HOW I BEHAVE AS A RESULT OF HOW
trainval/JD4O7ama3o8/50016 SO I USED TO SPEND MY LIFE PLAYING PERFORMING PEOPLE PLEASING BEING DEFIANT BEING THE REBEL BEING ANYONE
trainval/JD4O7ama3o8/50017 SO WHEN WE'RE TREATING ADDICTION SURE WE GOT TO GET PEOPLE SOBER FROM WHATEVER THEIR ADDICTIVE PATTERN IS
trainval/JD4O7ama3o8/50018 AND WHEN YOU LOOK IN THE MIRROR TO REALLY APPRECIATE THAT AND TO MAKE THE BEST FRIEND YOU CAN OF YOURSELF BECAUSE IF
trainval/JD4O7ama3o8/50019 THIS IS THE AA 12 STEP FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM WHICH FUNDAMENTALLY IS ABOUT SURRENDER
trainval/JD4O7ama3o8/50020 AND I THOUGHT SURRENDER TO HELP
trainval/JD4O7ama3o8/50022 SURRENDER TO HELP
trainval/JDDGhGiaAZU/50001 IT'S CALLED SATISFICING
trainval/JDDGhGiaAZU/50002 BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/JDDGhGiaAZU/50003 IF YOU HAD FINISHED SOME FORM OF HIGHER EDUCATION YOU GOT A RED KEY CORD WITH YOUR NAME TAG ON IT INSTEAD OF A BLUE ONE
trainval/jDfeDOWiw3g/50001 WE CAN TAKE ACTION
trainval/jdMv5x8SBuM/50001 AND THIS PHASE CHANGES ARE WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE AS HUMAN BEINGS
trainval/jdMv5x8SBuM/50002 THE FIRST IS THE ENERGY SHIFT
trainval/jdMv5x8SBuM/50003 IS THE MAIN POWER SOURCE OF OUR SOCIETY TODAY
trainval/jdMv5x8SBuM/50004 HOW CAN WE UNDERSTAND THE WORLD IN RAPIDLY CHANGING
trainval/jdMv5x8SBuM/50005 BUT THE QUESTION IS REALLY ABOUT YOU
trainval/jdMv5x8SBuM/50006 HOWEVER THE ENTIRE SOCIAL CONTRACT WILL NEED TO CHANGE IN ORDER TO ACCOMODATE THIS
trainval/jdMv5x8SBuM/50007 IF A COMPANY HAS STANDARDIZED AS THE LEADER OF FAST FOOD INDUSTRY
trainval/jdpIKXLLYYM/50001 IT'S UP TO US AS INDIVIDUALS TO TAKE CONTROL AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TYPE OF
trainval/jdpIKXLLYYM/50002 WALK THE DOG
trainval/jdpIKXLLYYM/50003 UP UNTIL THAT MOMENT I HAD BEEN THAT CLASSIC CORPORATE WARRIOR I WAS EATING TOO MUCH I WAS DRINKING TOO MUCH I
trainval/jdpIKXLLYYM/50004 IT'S TOTALLY DOMINATED BY WORK
trainval/jdpIKXLLYYM/50005 I WORK 10 HOURS A DAY I COMMUTE TWO HOURS A DAY
trainval/jdpIKXLLYYM/50006 ALL OF MY RELATIONSHIPS HAVE FAILED
trainval/jdpIKXLLYYM/50007 YOU WANT ME TO GO TO CHURCH AND CALL MY MOTHER
trainval/jdpIKXLLYYM/50008 MOREOVER I THINK IT CAN TRANSFORM SOCIETY
trainval/jE1j5Om7g0U/50001 IT WAS EFFORTLESS
trainval/jE1j5Om7g0U/50002 IT WAS SELFLESS
trainval/jE1j5Om7g0U/50003 IT WAS IMMENSELY JOYFUL
trainval/jE1j5Om7g0U/50004 NOW THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT HERE
trainval/jE1j5Om7g0U/50005 WHAT DOES THIS REALLY FEEL LIKE
trainval/jE1j5Om7g0U/50006 THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO RESIST THEM
trainval/jE1j5Om7g0U/50007 AND THEIR HEADS DIDN'T EXPLODE
trainval/jE1j5Om7g0U/50008 SO I WAS REALLY FOCUSING ON JUST STAYING ON THE TRAIL AND AT SOME POINT IN THAT RIDE THERE WAS NO ME
trainval/jE1j5Om7g0U/50009 THAT'S THE BEST WAY I CAN DESCRIBE IT
trainval/jE1j5Om7g0U/50010 AND THEY ALL REPORTED A VERY GOOD CORRESPONDENCE WITH INCREASED ACTIVITY IN THIS POSTERIOR CINGULATE AND GETTING IN THEIR OWN WAY
trainval/jE1j5Om7g0U/50011 WE CAN REALLY START TO PAY ATTENTION
trainval/jE1j5Om7g0U/50012 WE JUST HAVE TO GET OUT OF OUR OWN WAY
trainval/JeHqgambbcI/50001 THAT'S WHEN I HEARD HIM IN THE ROOM NEXT TO MINE
trainval/JeHqgambbcI/50002 I TRIED TO TALK SOME SENSE INTO HIM
trainval/JeHqgambbcI/50003 I EVEN SHOWED HIM WHERE I'D MADE MY NOTES IN HIS FOLDER
trainval/JeHqgambbcI/50004 WAS IT ALL WASTED
trainval/JeHqgambbcI/50005 I WAS BORN IN THE JOHANNESBURG TOWNSHIP OF SOWETO NOT FAR FROM HERE
trainval/JeHqgambbcI/50006 MY FATHER WAS AN ALCOHOLIC AND LIFE AT HOME WAS OFTEN VERY TENSE
trainval/JeHqgambbcI/50007 MY WORLD NEARLY DID COLLAPSE WHEN MY BROTHER DIED WHEN I WAS 14 YEARS OLD
trainval/JeHqgambbcI/50008 WHILE INTERROGATING MY JOURNEY THROUGH MEDICINE I ALSO SPOKE TO OTHER DOCTORS WHO HAD CHOSEN TO WALK AWAY
trainval/JeHqgambbcI/50009 SOME DOCTORS CRACKED UNDER THE PRESSURE
trainval/JeHqgambbcI/50011 IT'S A POWERFUL ACT TO PUT YOUR HAND UP AND SAY I'M STRUGGLING
trainval/jEHZSIAuYUY/50001 WE NEED TO BE CLEVER ABOUT IT TOO
trainval/jEHZSIAuYUY/50002 SO THAT WE CAN BRING SCIENCE TO NEW AUDIENCES
trainval/jEHZSIAuYUY/50003 TO TRANSLATE SCIENCE INTO A BRAND NEW LANGUAGE
trainval/jEHZSIAuYUY/50004 SO THAT WE CAN BRING THESE STORIES TO NEW AUDIENCES
trainval/jEHZSIAuYUY/50005 AUDIENCES WHO MAY NOT REALIZE THAT THEY ENJOY DANCE BECAUSE THEY HAVE NEVER
trainval/jEHZSIAuYUY/50006 BUT MAYBE THEY CAN GO AND SEE AND ENJOY A PROFESSIONAL BEAUTIFUL DANCE PERFORMANCE AND THEN OH BY
trainval/jEHZSIAuYUY/50007 WE CAN SHARE IN THE BEAUTY OF THE UNIVERSE AS SEEN BY A SCIENTIST
trainval/jEMfAJMw51A/50001 AND MAKE A BREATHABLE FUTURE
trainval/jeOumyTMCI8/50001 AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO TO ALL TRAFFIC SURVIVORS
trainval/jFG7jqJXbno/50001 IT'S NOT ABOUT YOUR PERFORMANCE IT'S ABOUT THEIR PERFORMANCE
trainval/jFG7jqJXbno/50002 OFTEN A VERY THEORETICAL ONE
trainval/jFG7jqJXbno/50003 AS CEO OF THE COMPANY HE FOUNDED
trainval/jFG7jqJXbno/50004 BECAUSE I ENTERED THE MOST CREATIVE PERIOD OF MY LIFE
trainval/jFG7jqJXbno/50005 AND THE POSITIVE RESULTS OF THAT PERIOD ALL THOSE WONDERFUL DEVICES APPLE CREATED STAYS WITH US AS WE SPEAK
trainval/jFG7jqJXbno/50006 NOBODY TAUGHT YOU HOW TO PICK THE BEST PERSON FOR THE JOB
trainval/jFG7jqJXbno/50007 NOW FOR THE AMERICAN FRIENDS WHEN I SEE FOOTBALL WHAT I MEAN IS SOCCER
trainval/jFG7jqJXbno/50008 IT'S NOT TAKING YOUR TEAM TO THE OPERA
trainval/jFG7jqJXbno/50009 CULTURE IN BUSINESS IS THE WAY PEOPLE BEHAVE IN YOUR ORGANIZATION
trainval/jFG7jqJXbno/50010 EVERYBODY IN A SPORTS TEAM KNOWS IT'S ABOUT WINNING THE GAME
trainval/jFG7jqJXbno/50011 IT'S A NIGHTMARE
trainval/jFG7jqJXbno/50012 WE ACT AS IF EVERYBODY DELIVERS THE SAME PERFORMANCE
trainval/jFG7jqJXbno/50013 NOW IMAGINE THIS KIND OF RED T SHIRT CRISTIANO RONALDO THE BEST FOOTBALL PLAYER IN THE WORLD IMAGINE
trainval/jFG7jqJXbno/50014 IN SPORTS IT'S NOT POSSIBLE
trainval/jFG7jqJXbno/50015 BECAUSE ANYBODY CAN SEE HOW GOOD THIS GUY IS
trainval/jFG7jqJXbno/50016 AND HOW OFTEN DO YOU DO IT
trainval/jFG7jqJXbno/50017 BECAUSE PERFORMANCE IS HIGHLY VISIBLE
trainval/jFG7jqJXbno/50018 AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THINGS FALL IN PLACE
trainval/jFG7jqJXbno/50019 WHEN WE'VE GIVEN IT ALL WE'VE GOT WE ARE AS PERFECT AS WE CAN BE
trainval/jfqwHT3u1S8/50001 THE MARKET VALUE OF HIS COMPANY GOES FROM 90 MILLION TO 10 BILLION DOLLARS AND I CAN TELL YOU BECAUSE
trainval/jfqwHT3u1S8/50002 YOUR MOST PRECIOUS ASSET GOES OUT THE ELEVATOR EVERY NIGHT
trainval/jfqwHT3u1S8/50004 BUT YOU ALSO NEED TO HAVE VALUES
trainval/jfqwHT3u1S8/50005 IT'S NOT BAD
trainval/jfqwHT3u1S8/50006 SUNLIGHT IS THE BEST DISINFECTANT
trainval/jfqwHT3u1S8/50007 WE NEED TO REINVENT THE WHOLE MODEL OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH
trainval/jfqwHT3u1S8/50008 THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY NEEDS TO PLACE ASSETS IN A COMMONS
trainval/jfqwHT3u1S8/50009 THEY NEED TO START SHARING PRECOMPETITIVE RESEARCH
trainval/jfqwHT3u1S8/50010 BUT IN THE TUNISIAN REVOLUTION THE NEW MEDIA DIDN'T CAUSE THE REVOLUTION IT WAS CAUSED BY
trainval/jfqwHT3u1S8/50011 IT WAS A TOOL OF SELF DEFENSE
trainval/jfqwHT3u1S8/50012 BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE THIS IS MOVING FORWARD
trainval/jfqwHT3u1S8/50013 THERE WAS NO CONCEPT OF PROGRESS
trainval/jfqwHT3u1S8/50014 THE PRINTING PRESS GAVE US ACCESS TO RECORDED KNOWLEDGE
trainval/jfqwHT3u1S8/50015 THE INTERNET GIVES US ACCESS NOT JUST TO INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE BUT TO THE INTELLIGENCE CONTAINED IN THE
trainval/jfqwHT3u1S8/50016 THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IS IN DEEP TROUBLE
trainval/jgnqlZUI4n8/50001 I WAS FOLLOWING
trainval/jguSkEMwrcc/50001 AND I'M SURE THOSE ARCHITECTS ARE INSPIRED AS I AM BY WHAT SURROUNDS US BY NATURE
trainval/jguSkEMwrcc/50002 AND THIS IS QUITE A GOOD WAY OF DOING IT
trainval/jguSkEMwrcc/50003 I'M ALSO WORKING NOW WITH X RAY VIDEO
trainval/JGVU8n7jjHc/50001 WELL QVC TOOK A BIG DIVE AND THEY ARE LIKE WHY AREN'T THESE PEOPLE SELLING THEIR PRODUCTS
trainval/JGVU8n7jjHc/50002 YOUR JOBS APPLICATIONS ARE NOT PRINTED OFF THIS IS WHAT MIKE ROWE DOES
trainval/JGVU8n7jjHc/50003 IF YOU ARE DOING YOUR JOB AND IF YOU LOVE IT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE YOU SUCCESSFUL
trainval/JGVU8n7jjHc/50004 LET'S DO IT BECAUSE THEN I CAN TAKE THAT AND DO SOMETHING ELSE
trainval/JGVU8n7jjHc/50005 SO THANK YOU GUYS FOR YOUR TIME I REALLY APPRECIATE IT
trainval/jh7TYJHec2s/50001 PUT YOUR HAND ON THEIR SHOULDER AND GIVE LOVE
trainval/jh7TYJHec2s/50002 BUT I HAVE THE FEELING THAT THERE IS SOME KIND OF LOVE REDUCTION GOING ON
trainval/jh7TYJHec2s/50003 OPEN YOUR BOOKS
trainval/jh7TYJHec2s/50004 I LOVE NIRVANA
trainval/jh7TYJHec2s/50005 GIVE THEM THE FEELING THAT THEY ARE OK
trainval/jh7TYJHec2s/50006 WE MISS LOVE
trainval/jh7TYJHec2s/50007 IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE LIKE THAT
trainval/jh7TYJHec2s/50008 KEEP ON LOVING
trainval/jh7TYJHec2s/50009 I'M A GOOD TEACHER
trainval/jHLm5Lne3D0/50001 I FLEW HERE ACTUALLY FROM NECKER ISLAND
trainval/jHLm5Lne3D0/50003 THE FOUNDER OR THE MANAGER HAS TO ANSWER IT
trainval/jHLm5Lne3D0/50004 IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING TO SEE
trainval/jhm5OaXJVMQ/50002 I HAVE TWO YOUNGER DEAF BROTHERS WHO ARE THE SAME WAY
trainval/jhm5OaXJVMQ/50004 THAT I PROBABLY WOULD NOT LEARN HOW TO SPEAK OR HEAR VERY WELL BUT I WANTED TO TRY
trainval/jhm5OaXJVMQ/50006 MAYBE IT WOULD WORK
trainval/jhm5OaXJVMQ/50007 I WANT TO START OFF WITH A QUESTION
trainval/jhm5OaXJVMQ/50009 THEN I WOULD GO TO MY PRACTICE MY SECOND PRACTICE I WOULD COME HOME AT NINE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT GO STRAIGHT TO
trainval/jhm5OaXJVMQ/50010 AND I SAW THE RESULTS
trainval/jhm5OaXJVMQ/50012 I HAVE DREAMS OF GOING TO LAW SCHOOL
trainval/jhm5OaXJVMQ/50013 PEOPLE ARE UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN THEY SEE NEW THINGS AND I THINK IT'S OUR JOB AS
trainval/jhm5OaXJVMQ/50014 YOU ARE WE ALL ARE
trainval/jhm5OaXJVMQ/50016 I HAVE TWO NOW BY THE WAY I FORGOT TO MENTION
trainval/jhm5OaXJVMQ/50017 I SAID OH I'M FROM NEW YORK
trainval/jhm5OaXJVMQ/50018 WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY IDEA
trainval/jhm5OaXJVMQ/50020 MOST OF THE TIME IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE SCARED OR THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND
trainval/jiDQDLnEXdA/50001 A RESUME TELLS A STORY
trainval/jiDQDLnEXdA/50002 HE NEVER FINISHES COLLEGE
trainval/jiDQDLnEXdA/50003 THEY EMBRACE THEIR TRAUMA AND HARDSHIPS AS KEY ELEMENTS OF WHO THEY'VE BECOME AND KNOW
trainval/jiDQDLnEXdA/50004 PEOPLE WHO OVERCOME ADVERSITY DON'T DO IT ALONE
trainval/jiDQDLnEXdA/50005 SHE WATCHED ME WORK AND ENCOURAGED ME TO FOCUS ON MY FUTURE AND NOT DWELL ON MY
trainval/jiDQDLnEXdA/50006 COMPANIES THAT ARE COMMITTED TO DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIVE PRACTICES TEND TO
trainval/JiwZQNYlGQI/50001 IT WASN'T UNTIL MIDDLE SCHOOL WHEN I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING MYSELF TO CLASSES ON TIME AND REMEMBERING TO BRING MY OWN
trainval/JiwZQNYlGQI/50002 I STARTED HAVING TROUBLE MAKING IT TO CLASS ON TIME
trainval/JiwZQNYlGQI/50003 I THOUGHT IT WAS MOSTLY ABOUT GETTING DISTRACTED
trainval/JiwZQNYlGQI/50004 I'M HAPPIER AND MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN I'VE EVER BEEN IN MY LIFE
trainval/JiwZQNYlGQI/50005 WE LEARN HOW OUR BRAINS AND BODIES WORK BY WATCHING THOSE AROUND US
trainval/JiwZQNYlGQI/50006 IF YOU DON'T ADHD YOURSELF CHANCES ARE YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO DOES
trainval/JiwZQNYlGQI/50007 THEY'RE YOUR EMPLOYEE YOUR BOSS YOUR FRIEND THEY'RE IN THIS ROOM
trainval/JiXzBl8p9v8/50001 WHEN STUDENTS ASK ME WHAT CAN I DO FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
trainval/jJMBwqhD9DE/50001 AND EVEN MORE AMAZING THAN THE FACT THAT A SELF REPLICATING ORGANISM SOMEHOW CAME
trainval/jJMBwqhD9DE/50002 HOW ADVANCED COULD VERY ADVANCE LIFE BECOME
trainval/jJMBwqhD9DE/50003 THE LAST COUPLE OF CENTURIES HAVE BEEN A TRIUMPH OF MODERN ASTRONOMY
trainval/jJMBwqhD9DE/50004 WE CAN TRACK THE VERY FIRST STARS THAT FORMED IN THE FIRST FEW HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF YEARS AFTER THE UNIVERSE WAS
trainval/jJMBwqhD9DE/50005 WE CAN TRACK THE FORMATION OF GALAXIES
trainval/jJMBwqhD9DE/50006 SO I WANTED TO TAKE A MINUTE TO LOOK BACK BRIEFLY AT ONE OF THE STILL IMAGES FROM THE
trainval/jJMBwqhD9DE/50007 AND THAT REFLECTS THE LIFETIME OF THE CIVILIZATIONS THAT MIGHT BE
trainval/jJMBwqhD9DE/50008 WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF AN INTELLIGENT CIVILIZATION
trainval/jJXMvOqS5bM/50001 I WORK WITH SURGICAL TEAMS
trainval/jJXMvOqS5bM/50002 THE TRADITIONAL SURGERY IS TO TAKE A BIT OF THE CRANIUM OFF A BIT OF THE SKULL DRAIN THIS FLUID OUT STICK A DRAIN IN
trainval/jJXMvOqS5bM/50003 WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU IS A REPRODUCTION OF THIS CHILD
trainval/Jk0AknXMXmc/50001 I STUDIED THIS PEPTIDE FOR TWO YEARS
trainval/jk0Y3Ss212w/50001 HER NAME WAS ALLIE
trainval/jk0Y3Ss212w/50002 BECAUSE THEIR PURPOSES ARE DIFFERENT THAN OURS WE MIGHT TREAT THEM AS A LITTLE LESS IMPORTANT
trainval/jk0Y3Ss212w/50003 SO I WANT YOU TO TAKE A MOMENT AND ASK YOURSELF
trainval/jk0Y3Ss212w/50004 WE MUST REALIZE ALL LIVING THINGS HAVE A PURPOSE AND THAT EVEN THOUGH WE MAY NOT UNDERSTAND THAT PURPOSE
trainval/jk6Y3f2c4SI/50001 THIS PLEASURE PRINCIPLE AT THE HEART OF THE CREATIVE ENERGY IS METAPHORICALLY KNOWN AS OSUN
trainval/jk6Y3f2c4SI/50002 SO NOW OSUN HONEY AND OSUNALITY RE AFFIRM THE NORMALITY OF SEXUAL PLEASURE AND THE
trainval/jKAehegqTvg/50001 I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT WASN'T GOING OH YES
trainval/jKAehegqTvg/50002 THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE SMARTER THAN US BECAUSE TO THEM IT ISN'T TECHNOLOGY
trainval/jKAehegqTvg/50003 I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE HIM THAT MUCH SO I WOULDN'T LET HIM KISS ME
trainval/jKAehegqTvg/50004 ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY HAD MOBILE TECHNOLOGY
trainval/jKAehegqTvg/50005 THEY WERE ON THE INTERNET FOR EVERYTHING
trainval/jKAehegqTvg/50006 DOES ANYONE ELSE REMEMBER THAT
trainval/jKAehegqTvg/50007 IF YOU DON'T PROVIDE YOUR CHILDREN WITH LEADERSHIP OF COURSE WILL TURN SOMEWHERE ELSE
trainval/jKAehegqTvg/50008 OH I DON'T DO THAT
trainval/jKAehegqTvg/50009 NOW I HAD AN EIGHT YEAR OLD BY THIS TIME I HAD PROGRESSED I HAD GROWN
trainval/jKAehegqTvg/50010 EVERY SINGLE PARENT THAT I'VE TALKED TO OF A TEENAGER ALL SAY ARE THEY LOOKING AT PORN
trainval/jKAehegqTvg/50011 EVERY SINGLE PARENT SAYS I DON'T THINK SO
trainval/jKAehegqTvg/50012 IT'S JUST AWKWARD
trainval/jKAehegqTvg/50013 THEY'RE UP ALL NIGHT WATCHING PORN
trainval/jKAehegqTvg/50014 AND THEN THEY DON'T HAVE ANYONE TO TALK TO BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT'S BAD
trainval/jKAehegqTvg/50015 HOW DO I KNOW THEY'RE WATCHING PORN
trainval/jKAehegqTvg/50016 THEY TELL ME ALL THE TIME
trainval/jKAehegqTvg/50017 I'LL EVEN ASK EIGHT YEAR OLDS
trainval/jKAehegqTvg/50018 I SAY WHAT DO YOU LOOK AT ON THE INTERNET
trainval/jKAehegqTvg/50019 SO I SAID OK I NEED TO TALK TO HIM
trainval/jKAehegqTvg/50020 TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON TAKE ME THROUGH A DAY
trainval/jKAehegqTvg/50021 THEN THEY DRAG THEIR MOUTH DOWN THE GUY'S PENIS LEAVING A RAINBOW BEHIND
trainval/jKAehegqTvg/50022 IF THEY DON'T DO THAT THEN THEY HAVE TO DRINK TWO OR THREE SHOTS
trainval/jKM0jlPW8x0/50001 HIGH IMPORT DUTIES OFTEN COMPOUND THE PROBLEM SOMETIMES DOUBLING THE PRICE OF A CAR
trainval/jKM0jlPW8x0/50002 BUT ONCE AFRICAN INDUSTRY STARTS TO SCALE THE POTENTIAL IS HUGE
trainval/JKsHhXwqDqM/50001 SO THERE MUST BE OTHER REASONS FOR ACCUMULATING WEALTH THAN JUST LIFE CYCLE TO EXPLAIN WHAT WE SEE IN THE
trainval/JKsHhXwqDqM/50003 SOME FAMILIES MAKE HUGE CAPITAL GAINS
trainval/JKsHhXwqDqM/50004 SO RIGHT NOW THE MOST CAPITAL INTENSIVE SECTORS IN THE ECONOMY ARE THE REAL ESTATE SECTOR
trainval/JKsHhXwqDqM/50005 SOME MADE BAD INVESTMENTS
trainval/JKsHhXwqDqM/50007 WHAT DO YOU ANSWER TO THAT
trainval/JKsHhXwqDqM/50008 I THINK INEQUALITY UP TO A POINT CAN ACTUALLY BE USEFUL FOR INNOVATION AND GROWTH
trainval/JlbwchclCBo/50001 TRY AND GUESS WHO THEY ARE
trainval/JlbwchclCBo/50002 WHAT MIGHT THAT TELL US
trainval/JLLpWtHbMAo/50001 HOW DID HE DIE
trainval/JLLpWtHbMAo/50002 THE ROUNDS COULD BE HEARD EVERYWHERE
trainval/JLLpWtHbMAo/50003 AND WHEN YOU HEAR THAT PHRASE IN THE NEWS THE FOG OF WAR I'M HERE TO TELL YOU IT'S REAL
trainval/JLLpWtHbMAo/50004 WE CONSOLIDATED WE MOVED TO A NEW POSITION
trainval/JLLpWtHbMAo/50005 FIRE BROKE OUT AGAIN A SECOND TIME
trainval/JLLpWtHbMAo/50006 I FELT RELEVANT
trainval/JLLpWtHbMAo/50007 DIVORCE RATE UP
trainval/JLLpWtHbMAo/50008 AND SADLY SUICIDE UP
trainval/JLLpWtHbMAo/50009 WE HAD TO RESPOND WE HAD TO INTERVENE
trainval/JLLpWtHbMAo/50010 I GOT TO TAMPA DECEMBER BEFORE CHRISTMAS
trainval/JLLpWtHbMAo/50011 30 AT NIGHT DRIVING DOWN HIGHWAY 19 IN CLEARWATER FLORIDA
trainval/JLLpWtHbMAo/50012 I GAVE HER OUR ANSWERS
trainval/JLLpWtHbMAo/50013 THOUGHTS FLOODED MY MIND
trainval/JLLpWtHbMAo/50014 SHE CHALLENGED ME
trainval/JLLpWtHbMAo/50015 CAN I CALL YOU BACK IN A COUPLE OF DAYS
trainval/JLLpWtHbMAo/50016 ABSOLUTELY LET'S DO IT
trainval/JLLpWtHbMAo/50017 I WANT YOU TO HAVE ONE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EXPERT ON YOUR TEAM JUST TO PROTECT YOU FROM YOURSELVES
trainval/JLLpWtHbMAo/50018 THAT WAS GOOD THINKING
trainval/JLLpWtHbMAo/50019 I HAD A SEVEN MONTH PERIOD IN MY LIFE WHERE I KEPT A LOG
trainval/JLLpWtHbMAo/50020 SUICIDAL IDEATIONS ARE GOING UP AND THAT'S A GOOD THING BECAUSE THAT MEANS PEOPLE ARE IDENTIFYING SELF IDENTIFYING
trainval/JLLpWtHbMAo/50021 THEY DON'T WANT TO GO INTO THE SYSTEM THEY FEAR THE SYSTEM
trainval/JLLpWtHbMAo/50022 SO THEY COME TO US AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING
trainval/JLLpWtHbMAo/50023 THANK GOODNESS WOMEN AREN'T AS AFFLICTED WITH THIS CHALLENGE
trainval/JLLpWtHbMAo/50024 IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING ELSE
trainval/JLLpWtHbMAo/50025 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/jLOfXsFlb18/50001 INNOVATIONS THAT WE'VE CREATED AS HUMAN BEINGS COME DOWN TO THE THINGS THAT WE VALUE AND
trainval/jLOfXsFlb18/50002 THAT IS A MICROCOSM OF ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON IN THE REST OF THE WORLD
trainval/jLOfXsFlb18/50003 IN OTHER WORDS LEARNS HOW TO GET ALONG WITH EACH OTHER AND BECOMES INTERDEPENDENT WITH EVERY OTHER LIVING THING
trainval/jLOfXsFlb18/50004 HOW WE MIGHT FOSTER THAT
trainval/jLOfXsFlb18/50005 HOW DO WE NEED TO BEHAVE
trainval/jLOfXsFlb18/50006 WE CAN MOVE OTHER LIVING THINGS OUT OF THE WAY
trainval/jLOfXsFlb18/50007 I THINK WE NEED TO JUST RESTORE THAT KIND OF VALUE INTO ALL OF OUR LIVES
trainval/jLOfXsFlb18/50008 THANK YOU ALL
trainval/jLOfXsFlb18/50009 BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BE ABLE TO BUILD AND RESTORE
trainval/JM77aTk1XyI/50001 IT'S THIS SECRET LANGUAGE
trainval/JM77aTk1XyI/50002 IT JUST DOESN'T WORK
trainval/JM77aTk1XyI/50003 THEY FOUND THAT ALSO THESE SPERM WHALES CAN CRAM 1600 MICRO CLICKS
trainval/JM77aTk1XyI/50004 WE'VE HAD OUR CURRENT SIZE BRAIN AROUND 200000 YEARS
trainval/JM77aTk1XyI/50005 IT'S IN MANY WAYS MORE COMPLEX AND EVOLVED
trainval/JM77aTk1XyI/50006 WE'RE ALREADY DOING THIS WITH MICE WE'RE ALREADY DOING THIS WITH BATS I THINK WE SHOULD START DOING IT WITH SPERM
trainval/JmCtZzSRztQ/50001 IT'LL GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DO WHEN I'M BORED RIGHT
trainval/JmCtZzSRztQ/50002 AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO AIR OUT ALL OF THIS BAD STUFF THAT'S BEEN BOTTLED UP INSIDE OF YOU AND THEN
trainval/JmCtZzSRztQ/50003 IN FACT IT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE BOOK
trainval/JmCtZzSRztQ/50004 IT WAS THE VERY DEFINITION OF ABSURD TO ME AT THAT MOMENT
trainval/JmCtZzSRztQ/50005 AND IT'S PRETTY EXPENSIVE ACTUALLY
trainval/JmCtZzSRztQ/50006 SO THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT FOR YOU TODAY
trainval/jMVAgCPYYHY/50001 VISIBLE LIGHT HAS A WAVELENGTH A SIZE THAT'S MUCH SMALLER THAN THE THINGS AROUND YOU THE FEATURES ON
trainval/jMVAgCPYYHY/50002 THAT'S BOB INTERRUPTING
trainval/jMVAgCPYYHY/50003 THE PROBLEM IS ALL THE INTERESTING PHYSICS HAPPENS IN THE CORE AND THE CORE IS HIDDEN BEHIND THOUSANDS OF KILOMETERS OF
trainval/jMVAgCPYYHY/50004 WE'LL NEVER SEE THROUGH IT IT'S OPAQUE TO LIGHT
trainval/JmZpFy1QUww/50001 WOMEN WERE ENTERING THE WORKPLACE FOR THE FIRST TIME AND SEPARATE RESTROOMS WERE SOCIETY'S RESPONSE TO A RAPIDLY
trainval/JmZpFy1QUww/50002 SEGREGATION HAS SPREAD FEAR THROUGHOUT AN ALREADY TENSE WHITE POPULATION THAT IF BLACKS WERE ALLOWED TO USE PUBLIC
trainval/JmZpFy1QUww/50003 THE POLITICS OF PUBLIC RESTROOMS HAVE A NEW TARGET NOW
trainval/JmZpFy1QUww/50004 THE WAY YOU EXPRESS YOURS WILL BE DIFFERENT THAN THE WAY OTHERS EXPRESS THEIRS
trainval/JmZpFy1QUww/50005 BUT AS TRANSGENDER PEOPLE GROW THEIR GENDER IDENTITY DOES NOT TURN OUT THE WAY THEIR DOCTOR EXPECTED
trainval/JmZpFy1QUww/50006 THE MOST RECENT ESTIMATES OF THE TRANSGENDER POPULATION ARE 0
trainval/JmZpFy1QUww/50007 4 MILLION PEOPLE
trainval/JmZpFy1QUww/50008 SINCE THEY WERE BOTH THE SAME I CHOSE THE DOOR ON THE RIGHT
trainval/JmZpFy1QUww/50009 SO IF I DON'T HAVE A REASON TO BE AFRAID IN A PUBLIC RESTROOM WHO DOES
trainval/JmZpFy1QUww/50010 A CUSTOMER HAD TO INTERVENE TO STOP WHAT WAS HAPPENING
trainval/JmZpFy1QUww/50011 MANY TRANSGENDER PEOPLE DO THEIR BEST TO AVOID PUBLIC RESTROOMS ENTIRELY BECAUSE OF THE FREQUENT INCONSISTENT TROUBLE THEY
trainval/JmZpFy1QUww/50012 EIGHT PERCENT OF US TRANS PEOPLE SURVEYED SHOWED THAT THEY HAD KIDNEY OR URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS OR OTHER KIDNEY RELATED
trainval/JmZpFy1QUww/50013 IF YOU HAD TO GO HOME EVERY TIME YOU HAD TO USE THE BATHROOM HOW FAR COULD YOU REALLY GO AND WHAT LIFE
trainval/JmZpFy1QUww/50014 THEY HAD TO WAIT LINE A WHILE BUT EVENTUALLY GOT IN AND OUT
trainval/JmZpFy1QUww/50015 THE EASIEST THING YOU CAN DO TO STOP THE VIOLENCE IN PUBLIC RESTROOMS IS TO BE LIKE THE MEN IN THE WALMART
trainval/JmZpFy1QUww/50016 DON'T POINT OR STARE DON'T TELL PEOPLE THEY'RE IN THE WRONG PLACE
trainval/JN3mW2IzCrc/50001 THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT
trainval/JN3mW2IzCrc/50002 I LOVED MY WORK
trainval/JN3mW2IzCrc/50003 I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT HOW YOU COULD CHANGE THAT
trainval/jnS66SszwEs/50001 AND FOR THIS WORLD THAT HE WAS GOING TO CREATE HE WAS GOING TO POPULATE IT WITH BEINGS THAT WERE BOTH MAN AND
trainval/jnS66SszwEs/50002 HE REALIZED WHAT KIND OF SIN HE HAD BROUGHT INTO THE WORLD
trainval/jnS66SszwEs/50003 THIS IS HOW YOU CREATE A BEING THAT'S BOTH MAN AND WOMAN IN ONE BODY
trainval/jnS66SszwEs/50004 LET'S GO BACK TO THIS PLAN
trainval/jnS66SszwEs/50005 AND SO SHIVA ONCE AGAIN CAME TO THE RESCUE
trainval/jnS66SszwEs/50006 LET'S START AT THE BEGINNING LET'S START WITH THE STORY OF CREATION
trainval/jnS66SszwEs/50007 SOME THINGS MAKE SENSE OK YOU KNOW
trainval/jnS66SszwEs/50008 I LOVE THIS ONE THE BEST
trainval/jnS66SszwEs/50009 HE'S RICH HE'S SPOILED HE CAN HAVE ANYBODY HE WANTS HE CAN DO ANYTHING HE WANTS AND SHE WANTS HIM ALL TO HERSELF
trainval/jnS66SszwEs/50010 AND THAT IS A STORY THAT'S BECOMING COMPLETELY OBSOLETE
trainval/jnS66SszwEs/50011 AND SHE SAYS WELL I AM COMPLETELY FED UP BECAUSE IN ALL MY LIFE THERE'S
trainval/jnS66SszwEs/50012 THE KING PUT OUT A REWARD
trainval/JNSgdmKysxA/50001 LOTS OF ANIMAL PRODUCTS
trainval/JNSgdmKysxA/50002 AND SHE WAS FRUSTRATED
trainval/JNSgdmKysxA/50003 SHE SAID IT RUNS IN HIS FAMILY
trainval/JNSgdmKysxA/50004 NOW IN THIS COUNTRY WE SPEND ABOUT 10 OF OUR HOUSEHOLD INCOME ON FOOD
trainval/JNSgdmKysxA/50005 OTHER COUNTRIES SPEND ABOUT 30
trainval/JNSgdmKysxA/50006 FOOD IS THE ONE AREA THAT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR
trainval/JNSgdmKysxA/50007 I CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO EAT WELL
trainval/JNSgdmKysxA/50008 OUR BODIES ARE AMAZING
trainval/jNSOh4xILSc/50001 WAS IT EASY
trainval/jNSOh4xILSc/50002 I WILL TELL YOU
trainval/jNSOh4xILSc/50003 DON'T EXPECT COMPANIES TO HELP YOU FIGHT HOMELESSNESS
trainval/jobYTQTgeUE/50001 YOUR FIRST INSTINCT IS TO LAUGH AT THE FLAT EARTHERS AND ASSUME THEY MUST BE INCREDIBLY DENSE OR CRAZY
trainval/jobYTQTgeUE/50002 IT STANDS FROM FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES THAT GOVERN THE WAY OUR MINDS WORK AND THE WAY WE STORE KNOWLEDGE
trainval/jobYTQTgeUE/50003 IF WE REALLY WANT TO IMPROVE THE WAY WE GRAPPLE WITH THESE CHALLENGES WE HAVE TO GO DEEPER WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT
trainval/jobYTQTgeUE/50004 WE ALL BELIEVE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN
trainval/jobYTQTgeUE/50005 OF COURSE WE DO IT'S THE MOST BASIC FACT IN THE WORLD
trainval/jobYTQTgeUE/50006 CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS THAT SUPPORT THAT BELIEF
trainval/jobYTQTgeUE/50007 WE ALL KNOW IT'S TERRIBLE FOR US RIGHT
trainval/jobYTQTgeUE/50008 HOW DOES IT EVEN FORM
trainval/jobYTQTgeUE/50009 ONE APPROACH HE TOOK WAS TO ANALYZE THE RESULT OF MEMORY EXPERIMENTS WHERE PEOPLE WERE ASKED TO
trainval/jobYTQTgeUE/50010 USING THE DATA HE WAS ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE RATE AT WHICH WE CAN ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE AND ALSO THE RATE
trainval/jobYTQTgeUE/50011 AFTER ALL WE ALL THINK IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD TO KNOW A LOT AND HAVE GREAT
trainval/jobYTQTgeUE/50012 IT'S NATURAL TO THINK ABOUT THINKING AS WHAT HAPPENS BETWEEN YOUR EARS BUT THAT'S NOT WHERE THE MAGIC
trainval/jobYTQTgeUE/50013 CHIMPANZEES ROUTINELY FAIL AT TASKS THAT REQUIRE SHARING KNOWLEDGE AND WORKING TOGETHER TO
trainval/jobYTQTgeUE/50014 FOOD IS COLLECTED AND STORED THE HIVE IS PROTECTED FROM INTRUDERS GENETIC DIVERSITY IS INTRODUCED
trainval/jobYTQTgeUE/50015 IN THAT TIME THERE WERE 75 CHIEF ENGINEERS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROJECT AND
trainval/jobYTQTgeUE/50016 SO THAT'S THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE KNOWLEDGE SHARING STORY
trainval/jobYTQTgeUE/50017 THE KEY IS SPECIALIZATION
trainval/jobYTQTgeUE/50018 HE TOLD ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT SCIENTISTS HAD NOT YET EXPLAINED WHY THE ROCKS GLOW
trainval/jobYTQTgeUE/50019 UNSURPRISINGLY THEY SAID THEY HAD NO CLUE
trainval/jobYTQTgeUE/50020 THIS MAKES PERFECT SENSE THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE ROCKS
trainval/jobYTQTgeUE/50021 IT WAS AS IF THE SCIENTISTS' KNOWLEDGE HAD BEEN DIRECTLY TRANSMITTED TO THEM EVEN THOUGH IT WAS NEVER DESCRIBED
trainval/jobYTQTgeUE/50022 THE SAME IS TRUE OF PEOPLE
trainval/jobYTQTgeUE/50023 WE LIVE IN THE ILLUSION THAT WE HAVE ARRIVED AT OUT OWN POSITIONS VIA A SERIOUS ANALYSIS AND THAT WE CAN
trainval/jobYTQTgeUE/50024 THEREFORE WHEN SOMEONE DOESN'T BELIEVE WHAT WE BELIEVE IT'S OBVIOUS WHAT THE PROBLEM IS
trainval/jobYTQTgeUE/50025 NOW THE POINT IS DECIDEDLY NOT THAT PEOPLE ARE STUPID
trainval/jobYTQTgeUE/50026 OF COURSE WE HAVE TO TAKE POSITIONS ON ISSUES WITHOUT KNOWING EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM AND IF WE
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50001 I'M REALLY SERIOUS
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50002 I WANT TO FIX THIS PROBLEM
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50003 HOW DO I DO THIS
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50004 SO THE ISSUE IS YOUR FOCUS THE ISSUE IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50005 I DON'T DATE THE PETER PAN GUYS
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50006 OH OK SO YOU DO DATE THEM
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50007 SO WHY DO YOU CHOOSE THEM
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50008 AND WE MAY EVEN ADMIT TO OURSELVES
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50009 WE FIGURED THAT OUT SO QUICK
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50010 YEAH I PROBABLY SHOULD END IT
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50011 BUT WE DON'T
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50012 AND SO WHAT DO WE DO
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50013 WE SEPARATE FROM THEM
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50014 OH BUT THEY HAVE SO MUCH POTENTIAL AND WE HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50015 NO JUST RUN
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50016 THEY TELL HER THEY'RE AFFECTIONATE THEY WRITE POEMS THEY SING SONGS ALL THIS WONDERFUL STUFF
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50017 WHO DOES SHE FALL IN LOVE WITH
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50018 WHEN YOU WANT TO PUNCH SOMEBODY AND THEN YOU REALIZE
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50019 DO WE THINK WE ARE NOT WORTH IT
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50020 DO WE THINK WE HAVE TO SETTLE FOR THIS PERSON
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50021 WELL LET ME JUST PUT IT OUT THERE
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50022 I WANT THIS KIND OF PERSON WHO DOES THIS AND WHO IS INTERESTED IN THIS
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50023 WE HAVE TO BE BOLDER
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50024 IS THAT REALLY IMPORTANT
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50025 WE HAVE TO BE HAPPY WITH OURSELVES WE HAVE TO BE HAPPY WITH OUR PRESENCE AND HAPPINESS WILL COME TO
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50026 OH MY GOSH THEY GOING TO THINK I AM CRAZY MAYBE THAT'S A PROBLEM
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50027 OH WHATEVER MAKES YOU HAPPY
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50028 WE GOT MARRIED
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50029 DON'T LIE TO YOURSELF AND TELL YOURSELF
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50030 WELL THEY'RE JUST JEALOUS OR THEY NEVER HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50031 TALK TO A PROFESSIONAL A CONSULTANT A THERAPIST ANYONE JUST TALK TO SOMEONE ELSE TO
trainval/jodhovumkHQ/50032 BE BRAVE ENOUGH TO WALK AWAY
trainval/JoGCaI1HzYo/50001 IT WOULD SERVE A COUNTRY
trainval/JolJi3uLMOM/50001 WE'VE NEVER LET THEM GO WE'VE PACKED THEM UP WE'VE SAVED THEM UP WE'VE TRANSPORTED THEM WE'VE WRITTEN THEN AROUND BUT WE'VE
trainval/joyi6anTSFQ/50001 WHAT DO YOU WANT
trainval/joyi6anTSFQ/50002 THAT GAP BETWEEN LACK AND FULFILMENT IS UNCONFORTABLE
trainval/joyi6anTSFQ/50003 BUT IT'S THE DISCOMFORT THAT MOVES US FORWARD
trainval/joyi6anTSFQ/50004 THAT'S OK THIS IS WHAT THE LUNCH CHALLENGE IS ABOUT
trainval/joyi6anTSFQ/50005 BUT EACH TIME YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU WANT FOR LUNCH YOU'RE PRACTICING THE STEPS THAT TOGETHER REVEAL YOUR BIGGER
trainval/Jp9b2Hf7QWg/50002 MY QUESTION LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50001 TO FIND SOMETHING THAT I COULD SCREW UP
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50002 THAT'S HOW TOUGH IT WAS
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50004 IT DIDN'T MATTER WHAT IT WAS
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50005 IT TURNS OUT THAT OVER 80 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE AROUND DON'T ENJOY THEIR WORK
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50006 SO I WANTED TO FIND OUT WHAT IS IT THAT SETS THESE PEOPLE APART THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE PASSIONATE WORLD CHANGING WORK THAT WAKE UP INSPIRED
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50007 I WANTED TO FIND THE WORK THAT I COULDN'T NOT DO WHAT THAT WAS FOR ME
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50008 I DON'T LIKE MY JOB
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50009 BUT I WOULD HAVE TO WARN THEM BECAUSE AT THIS POINT MY QUIT RATE WAS ALSO 80 PERCENT
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50010 AND THAT LATER BECAME WHAT I NOW CALL LIVE YOUR LEGEND WHICH I'LL EXPLAIN IN A LITTLE BIT
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50011 IT'S ALL ABOUT JUST BUILDING YOUR RESUME
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50012 I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT FOR SORTING OUT WHAT IT IS THAT YOU'RE NATURALLY GOOD AT
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50013 BUT ONCE WE HAVE THIS FRAMEWORK TOGETHER WE CAN START TO IDENTIFY THE THINGS THAT MAKE US COME ALIVE
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50014 YOU KNOW BEFORE THIS A PASSION COULD COME AND HIT YOU IN THE FACE OR MAYBE IN YOUR POSSIBLE LINE OF WORK YOU MIGHT THROW IT AWAY
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50015 EITHER WAY WE START TO BELIEVE IT
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50016 EITHER WE GIVE UP OR WE NEVER START IN THE FIRST PLACE
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50017 THE THINGS IS EVERYONE WAS IMPOSSIBLE UNTIL SOMEBODY DID IT
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50018 EVERY INVENTION EVERY NEW THING IN THE WORLD PEOPLE THOUGHT WERE CRAZY AT FIRST
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50019 ROGER BANNISTER AND THE FOUR MINUTE MILE IT WAS A PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY TO BREAK THE FOUR MINUTE MILE IN A FOOT
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50020 AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50021 IF YOU DON'T THINK YOU CAN RUN A MILE YOU SHOW YOURSELF YOU CAN RUN A MILE OR TWO OR A MARATHON OR LOSE FIVE POUNDS OR
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50022 WE HAVE THIS LITTLE GROUP
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50025 YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SINK
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50026 HE'S LIKE BUT REALLY JUST HAVE FUN WITH THIS
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50027 AND HE DIVES IN SWIMS OFF
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50028 THIS IS WHY YOU DON'T LET NINE YEAR OLDS SWIM FROM ALCATRAZ
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50029 I JUST HAD NO IDEA HE WAS GOING TO SWIM
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50030 YOU ARE THE AVERAGE OF THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU SPEND THE MOST TIME WITH
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50031 THEY CHANGE EVERYTHING AND IT'S A PROVEN FACT
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50032 IN 1898 NORMAN TRIPLETT DID THIS STUDY WITH A BUNCH OF CYCLISTS AND HE WOULD MEASURE THEIR TIMES AROUND THE
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50033 AND ONE OF MY FRIENDS NOW HE HAS A FAMILY OF EIGHT AND HE SUPPORTS HIS WHOLE FAMILY
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50034 THEY JUST CAME BACK FROM A MONTH IN EUROPE ALL OF THEM TOGETHER
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50035 THIS BLEW MY MIND
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50036 AND THOSE PEOPLE HAVE MADE UP THAT COMMUNITY OF PASSIONATE FOLKS WHO INSPIRED THAT POSSIBILITY THAT I
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50037 THE PEOPLE CHANGE EVERYTHING AND THIS IS WHY
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50038 AND THEN I'M OVER HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND EVERYONE AROUND ME WAS DOING IT
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50039 MOST THINGS ARE TOTALLY OUT OF OUR HANDS
trainval/jpeSLKnS4gM/50040 WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE
trainval/jpRqbP9Nv9k/50001 YOU'RE NOT SMART ENOUGH
trainval/jpRqbP9Nv9k/50002 I SAY THAT BECAUSE I HAD POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION
trainval/jpRqbP9Nv9k/50003 I DON'T WANT TO DOWNPLAY THAT
trainval/jpRqbP9Nv9k/50004 WORKIN' MOMS IS THAT FOR ME
trainval/jpuDyGgIeh0/50001 YOU KNOW AS WE EVOLVED IN THE SERENGETI EXILE WAS A DEATH SENTENCE
trainval/jpuDyGgIeh0/50002 CAUSES HAVE EFFECTS
trainval/jpuDyGgIeh0/50003 AND IF WE DON'T GET THE SUPPLIES THAT WE NEED BIT BY BIT IT'S KIND OF LIKE WE'RE LIVING ON A
trainval/jpuDyGgIeh0/50004 PASSING MENTAL STATES BECOME LASTING NEURAL TRAITS
trainval/jpuDyGgIeh0/50005 FOR EXAMPLE TAXICAB DRIVERS IN LONDON AT THE END OF THEIR TRAINING HAVE A THICKER BRAIN IN
trainval/jpuDyGgIeh0/50006 SO THIS MENTAL EXPERIENCE OF STRESS ESPECIALLY IF IT'S CHRONIC AND MODERATE TO SEVERE GRADUALLY
trainval/jpuDyGgIeh0/50007 THE MIND CAN CHANGE THE BRAIN TO CHANGE THE MIND
trainval/jpuDyGgIeh0/50008 THE REASON FOR THE NEGATIVITY BIAS IS THAT OUR ANCESTORS HAD TO PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO BAD NEWS
trainval/jpuDyGgIeh0/50009 IT CREATES A FUNDAMENTAL BOTTLENECK IN THE BRAIN THAT CREATES A WEAKNESS IN BOTH INFORMAL EFFORTS
trainval/jpuDyGgIeh0/50010 PARADOXICALLY THE MORE WE TAKE IN THE GOOD WE'RE MORE ABLE TO SEE THE BAD AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
trainval/jpuDyGgIeh0/50011 IN FACT THIS IS ABOUT TAKING CONTROL OF THE BRAIN'S STONE AGE BIAS IN THE 21ST CENTURY
trainval/jpuDyGgIeh0/50012 CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE PAST
trainval/jpuDyGgIeh0/50013 A FEW MINUTES IN THE FUTURE WE START LOSING A LOT OF INFLUENCE
trainval/jpuDyGgIeh0/50014 BUT THE NEXT MINUTE IS A PHENOMENAL OPPORTUNITY FOR US
trainval/jpuDyGgIeh0/50015 LIKE ME BACK IN COLLEGE OR ANY ONE OF US TODAY OR OVER THE COURSE OF THIS EVENING WHAT WILL WE DO WITH THE MOST
trainval/jPyR3UDhOm4/50001 IT WAS BLACK OR WHITE
trainval/jPyR3UDhOm4/50002 AND HE TOLD ME
trainval/jPyR3UDhOm4/50003 WE DIDN'T GRASP WHAT WAS GOING ON
trainval/jPyR3UDhOm4/50004 RIGHT NOW THE DISCUSSION GOES
trainval/jPyR3UDhOm4/50005 I THINK THAT IS WRONG
trainval/jPyR3UDhOm4/50006 BECAUSE THEY MAY TURN OUT TO BE A MAJORITY
trainval/jPyR3UDhOm4/50007 HOW ARE WE GOING TO SOLVE CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS UNLESS WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE CIVIL SOCIETY AND
trainval/jPyR3UDhOm4/50008 AND THE PARADOX IS THAT THE DECADE BEFORE THE LAST DECADE WAS SO PROMISING
trainval/jPyR3UDhOm4/50009 STILL I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT NORWAY IS A COUNTRY WITH A STRONG SOCIAL CAPITAL BASE WHICH I THINK IS
trainval/jPyR3UDhOm4/50010 TO ME AND TO MY FAMILY
trainval/jQ95xlZeHo8/50001 I GOOGLED AUTISTIC PEOPLE ARE
trainval/jQ95xlZeHo8/50002 PEOPLE TEND TO DIAGNOSE AUTISM WITH REALLY SPECIFIC CHECK BOX DESCRIPTIONS BUT IN
trainval/jQ95xlZeHo8/50003 WHEN SOMETHING VERY EXCITING HAPPENS IN MY INNER WORLD I'VE JUST GOT TO RUN
trainval/jQ95xlZeHo8/50004 FOR INSTANCE MY LITTLE BROTHER HE'S VERY SEVERELY AUTISTIC
trainval/jQ95xlZeHo8/50005 ALL IN ALL I WOULDN'T TRADE MY AUTISM AND MY IMAGINATION FOR THE WORLD
trainval/jQ95xlZeHo8/50006 THEY CAN'T SPEAK
trainval/jQ95xlZeHo8/50007 HE CAN'T TALK AT ALL
trainval/JqokS3P1D9o/50001 WILL IT PASS THROUGH ALL OF THEM
trainval/JqokS3P1D9o/50002 YOU'VE GOT TO SEE IT
trainval/jqWHy6B0ADA/50001 EVERYTHING SEEMED GOOD AND TO BE GOING ACCORDING TO PLAN
trainval/jqWHy6B0ADA/50002 THE SECOND GROUP THEY WOULD GO LIKE THIS AFTER I INTRODUCED MYSELF AND MY NATIONALITY THEY WOULD PAUSE THINK
trainval/jqWHy6B0ADA/50003 I COULD SEE IN THEIR EYES THE FLASHBACK TO ALL THE NEWS OUT THERE
trainval/jqWHy6B0ADA/50004 ALL WE HAD WAS TWO SUITCASES
trainval/jqWHy6B0ADA/50005 AND THE THIRD AND MY FAVORITE GROUP THEY WOULD REACT LIKE THIS SO YOU'RE PERSIAN
trainval/jqWHy6B0ADA/50006 MY AUNT HAS THIS BEAUTIFUL PERSIAN CAT
trainval/jqWHy6B0ADA/50007 ABOUT THE SAME TIME I MADE A NEW FRIEND AMANDINE FROM PARIS
trainval/jqWHy6B0ADA/50008 FOR GOD'S SAKE I USED TO WRITE ABOUT IT
trainval/jqWHy6B0ADA/50009 BY THAT TIME I HAD SEVERAL PRESENTATIONS ABOUT IRAN EVEN ITS ANCIENT SUSTAINABLE ARCHITECTURE ITS CULTURE
trainval/jqWHy6B0ADA/50010 I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT SOMETHING MORE SELF EXPLANATORY THAT INSTEAD OF ME TALKING TO
trainval/jqWHy6B0ADA/50011 A GROUP WORKING ON RECEPTION DAY PREPARING PERSIAN SNACKS OF COURSE WITH SAFFRON
trainval/jqWHy6B0ADA/50012 AND THE THIRD CHAPTER OF THIS STORY GOES BEYOND INTRODUCING A COUNTRY IN THE MIDDLE EAST
trainval/jqWHy6B0ADA/50013 MEDIA CAN BE SO POWERFUL TO CREATE IGNORANCE AND DISTORT THE VIEW OF A GROUP OF
trainval/jqWHy6B0ADA/50014 WE REACHED OUT TO OTHER PHOTOGRAPHERS AND EVEN BLOGGERS WHO HAD GOOD PHOTOS OF IRAN
trainval/jqWHy6B0ADA/50015 AND TODAY I'M HERE ON THIS STAGE FOUR YEARS AFTER MY ARRIVAL IN THE US AND IF YOU ASK ME WHO
trainval/JRHzQG0aI8w/50001 EXCEPT IN ONE CATEGORY
trainval/JRHzQG0aI8w/50002 AND WHERE SHOULD THAT COME FROM
trainval/JRHzQG0aI8w/50003 AND WHAT IS A CHILD
trainval/JrJJxnSgCdo/50001 ONE EXTRA ORDER OF MAGNITUDE IN SPACE IS 10000 TIMES MORE CALCULATIONS
trainval/JrJJxnSgCdo/50002 NOW I USE THE WORD SKILL ADVISEDLY MODELS ARE NOT RIGHT OR WRONG THEY'RE ALWAYS WRONG
trainval/JrJJxnSgCdo/50004 THE QUESTION YOU HAVE TO ASK IS WHETHER A MODEL TELLS YOU MORE INFORMATION THAN YOU WOULD HAVE HAD
trainval/JrJJxnSgCdo/50005 WE KNOW THAT IT'S GOTTEN WARMER
trainval/JrJJxnSgCdo/50006 WE KNOW WHERE IT'S GOTTEN WARMER
trainval/JRWC1UlMjZQ/50001 WE'RE GOING TO BE REASONABLE PEOPLE
trainval/JRWC1UlMjZQ/50002 LIFE PARTNER SOUNDS VERY FORMAL
trainval/JRWC1UlMjZQ/50003 AND WHEN HATE CRIMES ARE INFLICTED THEY'RE USUALLY THE MOST VIOLENT CATEGORY
trainval/JRWC1UlMjZQ/50004 AND IT'S EVEN MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT
trainval/JRWC1UlMjZQ/50005 I'VE HAD ENOUGH
trainval/JRWC1UlMjZQ/50006 I KNOW OF A GAY COUPLE THAT WENT ON THEIR HONEY MOON
trainval/JRWC1UlMjZQ/50007 YOU MUST FILL OUT SEPARATE FORMS
trainval/JRWC1UlMjZQ/50008 YOU CANNOT APPROACH THIS PODIUM TOGETHER
trainval/JRWC1UlMjZQ/50009 I HAD A NETWORK OF SUPPORT
trainval/JRWC1UlMjZQ/50010 IT WAS A GREAT NIGHT
trainval/JRWC1UlMjZQ/50011 AND THE OTHER THING I THOUGHT WAS I'M SO RELIEVED SHE WOULDN'T TAKE MY HAND
trainval/JRWC1UlMjZQ/50012 BUT WE NUMB OURSELVES TO IT
trainval/JRWC1UlMjZQ/50013 I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES WE'VE BEEN IN THAT SAME SITUATION WHERE WE JUST DON'T TAKE
trainval/jryCoo0BrRk/50001 LIFE WENT AS AS IT DOES AND ELI BECAME FASCINATED BY HISTORY
trainval/jryCoo0BrRk/50002 WE DID LOTS OF PLANNING
trainval/jryCoo0BrRk/50003 AND GRADUALLY HIS FEARS ABATED
trainval/jryCoo0BrRk/50004 I TOLD MYSELF THAT PUBLIC SPEAKING JUST WASN'T MY THING AND THAT THAT WAS OK
trainval/jryCoo0BrRk/50005 AFRAID OF SPIDERS
trainval/jryCoo0BrRk/50006 I LEARNED MORE ABOUT HOW TO USE COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL STRATEGIES WITHOUT THE BRIBES AND IT TRANSFORMED THE WAY I
trainval/JS8fYhwrYzI/50001 HE WON THE PULITZER PRIZE FOR IT IN 1972
trainval/JS8fYhwrYzI/50002 HE GOES I LOVE WHAT YOU DO
trainval/JS8fYhwrYzI/50003 WE HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS THAT WE ARE FACING
trainval/JS8fYhwrYzI/50004 SHORT TERMISM PREVENTS CONGRESS SORRY IF THERE'S ANYONE IN HERE FROM
trainval/JS8fYhwrYzI/50005 IT WASN'T ALWAYS LIKE THIS
trainval/JS8fYhwrYzI/50006 AND UNLESS WE FIX FOR THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF SHORT TERMISM AND GET TO WHERE WE WANT TO BE
trainval/JS8fYhwrYzI/50007 IT WAS ITHACA
trainval/JS8fYhwrYzI/50008 IT REQUIRES US TO PUSH INTO IT
trainval/JS8fYhwrYzI/50010 IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE TOTAL CONTROL OVER
trainval/JS8fYhwrYzI/50011 AND IT ALL BEGINS REALLY WITH YOURSELF ASKING THIS
trainval/JS8fYhwrYzI/50012 WHAT IS YOUR LONGPATH
trainval/jSdBXFkQ3S8/50001 AND IT REMINDED ME OF MY DAYS WHEN I SAT IN THIS EXACT SAME PRISON
trainval/jSdBXFkQ3S8/50002 I GO TO WORK EVERY DAY AS AN ENGINEER AND I'M PAID TO DREAM
trainval/jseHPnqXlPY/50001 AND THAT THESE STAINED GLASSES THAT I'M SHOWING YOU AS I WILL SHOW YOU IN A MOMENT IN MORE DETAILS ARE ACTUALLY
trainval/jseHPnqXlPY/50002 TODAY WE ARE IN A PARTICULARLY EXCITING PERIOD IN HISTORY BECAUSE WITH MODERN NANOTECHNOLOGY TOOLS
trainval/jseHPnqXlPY/50003 HUMAN FASCINATION FOR CONTROLLING AND MANIPULATING LIGHT IS ACTUALLY MUCH OLDER THAN WELLS PROBABLY
trainval/jSGzkjHtFiA/50001 WHERE ARE WE GOING TO GET THIS MATERIAL FROM
trainval/jSGzkjHtFiA/50002 BUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO BUILD WITH IT
trainval/jSGzkjHtFiA/50003 WHAT DO WE DO
trainval/jSGzkjHtFiA/50004 IF HALF OF OUR ROVERS OR ROBOTS DON'T ARRIVE WELL IT WILL TAKE A BIT LONGER BUT YOU WILL STILL BE ABLE TO
trainval/JSLUS3qLv0I/50001 WE USED TO PLAY WHEN WE WERE KIDS
trainval/JSLUS3qLv0I/50002 WHEN WE ARRIVED AT OUR FINAL DESTINATION
trainval/JSLUS3qLv0I/50003 WE HAD HOMEMADE POTATO SALAD WHITE BUNS BOILED EGGS AND SAUSAGES
trainval/JSLUS3qLv0I/50004 AS CHILDREN WE WERE TAUGHT NOT TO HARM ANIMALS BUT THAT WE HAVE TO
trainval/JSLUS3qLv0I/50005 IT'S JUST THE WAY THINGS ARE
trainval/JSLUS3qLv0I/50006 NOWADAYS SHE HAS A DOG AND TWO CATS WHICH SHE LOVES A LOT
trainval/JSLUS3qLv0I/50007 PEOPLE OFTEN ASK ME WHY I'M A VEGAN WHY I BECAME VEGAN
trainval/JSLUS3qLv0I/50008 WHAT WE EAT ESPECIALLY ANIMAL PRODUCTS HAS A BIG IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50001 BUT IN ANY CASE IT'S NOT PART OF SCIENCE
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50002 I USED TO GET IN AN ARGUMENT THAT REALLY GAVE ME A STOMACHACHE
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50004 SCIENCE IS OBJECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS IS SUBJECTIVE THEREFORE THERE CANNOT BE A
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50005 IT IS AN ILLUSION LIKE SUNSETS
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50006 MAYBE CONSCIOUSNESS EXISTS BUT IT CAN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE WORLD
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50007 I THINK IT IS RATHER EASY TO DEFINE IF YOU ARE NOT TRYING TO GIVE A SCIENTIFIC DEFINITION
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50008 WE ARE NOT READY FOR A SCIENTIFIC DEFINITION BUT HERE IS THE COMMON SENSE DEFINITION
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50009 THAT'S AN AWFUL PROBLEM
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50010 AND THIS IF YOU HAVE EVER HAD A PHILOSOPHY COURSE THIS IS KNOWN AS THE FAMOUS MIND BODY PROBLEM
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50011 AND THEY ARE REALIZED IN THE BRAIN AS HIGHER LEVEL OR SYSTEM FEATURES
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50013 BECAUSE WE ARE THE VERY EXISTENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50014 IF IT CONSCIOUSLY SEEMS TO YOU THAT YOU ARE CONSCIOUS YOU ARE CONSCIOUS
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50015 YOU'RE A VERY CLEVERLY CONSTRUCTED ROBOT
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50016 I DON'T THINK
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50017 I DON'T THINK THAT FOR A MOMENT
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50018 MAYBE WE WILL BE ABLE TO BUILD A CONSCIOUS MACHINE BUT SINCE WE DON'T KNOW HOW OUR BRAINS DO IT WE ARE NOT IN THE POSITION
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50019 AND WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT IN A ROBOT
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50020 THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF ROBOTICS DERIVES FROM THE FACT THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE A CONSCIOUS ROBOT SO WE DON'T HAVE A
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50021 THE NEXT FEATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS AFTER THIS MARVELOUS UNIFIED CONSCIOUS FIELD IS THAT
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50022 AND THINK OF WHAT I HAVE TOLD YOU
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50023 NOW WITH THAT IN MIND WITH GOING THROUGH THESE VARIOUS FEATURES OF CONSCIOUSNESS LET'S GO
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50024 YOU CANNOT DOUBT THE EXISTENCE OF YOUR OWN CONSCIOUSNESS
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50025 BUT THE SECOND ONE HAD AN INCREDIBLE INFLUENCE AND MAY STILL BE AROUND AND THAT IS
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50026 NOW WE KNOW THAT THAT'S WRONG
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50027 I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50028 MORE THAT 30 YEARS AGO BUT THERE IS A DEEPER ARGUMENT IMPLICIT IN WHAT I'VE TOLD YOU
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50029 THAT'S THE FIRST FEATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50030 AND I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT ARGUMENT BRIEFLY AND THAT IS
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50031 WELL SOME COMPUTATIONS ARE INTRINSIC
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50032 BUT WHEN I HOLD OUT MY POCKET CALCULATOR AND DO THE CALCULATION THE ONLY INTRINSIC
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50033 COMPUTATION ONLY EXISTS RELATIVE TO CONSCIOUSNESS
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50034 I PROMISED TO REFUTE ALL THESE GUYS BUT I DON'T HAVE AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME LEFT BUT LET ME REFUTE A COUPLE MORE OF THEM
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50035 I MEAN I WON'T DEMONSTRATE PAIN BEHAVIOR BUT I CAN TELL YOU I AM NOT HAVING ANY PAINS RIGHT NOW
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50036 SO IT'S AN OBVIOUS MISTAKE
trainval/jSOPQgPIdKg/50037 WHY DID THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE
trainval/jSS03JfgHEA/50001 I SEE PEOPLE NODDING
trainval/jSS03JfgHEA/50002 AND THIS REFLECTS THE EXTRAORDINARY STRENGTH OF THE EMERGING INDIAN MIDDLE CLASS AND THE
trainval/jSS03JfgHEA/50003 I'LL GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE OF A FAX CAMPAIGN THAT I RAN
trainval/jSS03JfgHEA/50004 SO WHAT'S THE MORAL OF THIS STORY
trainval/jSS03JfgHEA/50005 AND I THINK WE ALL SENSE THAT SOMETHING BIG IS HAPPENING
trainval/jSS03JfgHEA/50006 BUT WHAT'S STRIKING IS THE COMMONALITIES THE STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF THESE NEW MODELS AND HOW THEY
trainval/jSS03JfgHEA/50007 MORE PARTICIPATION MORE PEER COORDINATION SOMETIMES DISTORTS OUTCOMES AND THERE ARE SOME THINGS LIKE THINGS FOR EXAMPLE
trainval/jSS03JfgHEA/50008 AND REMEMBER THAT IN THE 20TH CENTURY THIS WAS NOT AT ALL TRUE
trainval/jSS03JfgHEA/50009 TODAY FOR BETTER OR WORSE
trainval/jSS03JfgHEA/50010 NEW POWER VALUES PARTICIPATION AND NEW POWER IS ALL ABOUT DO IT YOURSELF
trainval/jSS03JfgHEA/50011 SO WE'VE SPENT A BIT OF TIME THINKING HOW CAN WE PLOT ORGANIZATIONS ON A TWO BY
trainval/jSS03JfgHEA/50012 ONCE YOU HAVE AN EXPERIENCE OF NEW POWER YOU TEND TO EXPECT AND WANT MORE OF IT
trainval/jSS03JfgHEA/50013 SO LET'S SAY YOU'VE USED A PEER TO PEER LENDING PLATFORM LIKE LENDING TREE OR PROSPER THEN YOU'VE FIGURED OUT THAT
trainval/jSS03JfgHEA/50014 AND IN FACT THAT MODEL MEANS THAT THE CHALLENGE FOR NEW POWER IS HOW DO YOU USE
trainval/jSS03JfgHEA/50015 BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT AN EXERCISE OF TOP DOWN PERFECTIONISM THEY ARE ABOUT THE NETWORK
trainval/jSS03JfgHEA/50016 SO WILL NEW POWER ELITES JUST BECOME OLD POWER AND SQUEEZE
trainval/jSS03JfgHEA/50017 OR WILL THAT NEW POWER BASE BITE BACK
trainval/jSS03JfgHEA/50018 AND TO ME THAT'S ABSOLUTELY WORTH TRYING FOR
trainval/jSSqQDPGW2k/50001 AND THIS SORT OF REPURPOSING IS ACTUALLY QUITE CHALLENGING
trainval/jSSqQDPGW2k/50002 WHEN DOCTORS FIRST SAW THIS MOOD ENHANCING EFFECT OF IPRONIAZID THEY DIDN'T REALLY RECOGNIZE WHAT THEY
trainval/jSSqQDPGW2k/50003 THEY WERE SO USED TO LOOKING AT IT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THIS ONE DISEASE THEY COULD NOT SEE THE LARGER
trainval/jSSqQDPGW2k/50004 AND MENTAL SET IS ANOTHER THING
trainval/jSSqQDPGW2k/50005 THAT'S SORT OF THIS PRECONCEIVED FRAMEWORK WITH WHICH WE APPROACH PROBLEMS
trainval/jSSqQDPGW2k/50006 AND THAT ACTUALLY MAKES REPURPOSING PRETTY HARD FOR ALL OF US WHICH IS I GUESS WHY THEY GAVE A TV SHOW
trainval/jSSqQDPGW2k/50007 IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT SURPRISING THEY WERE CAUGHT
trainval/jSSqQDPGW2k/50008 THEY HAVE TWO OTHER THINGS IN COMMON THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT
trainval/jSSqQDPGW2k/50009 AND THAT'S IN THE PATIENTS WHERE THEY DO WORK
trainval/jSSqQDPGW2k/50010 A PAINKILLER WILL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER BUT IS NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO TREAT THAT UNDERLYING DISEASE
trainval/jSSqQDPGW2k/50011 IT DIDN'T REALLY LOOK RIGHT TO ME
trainval/jSSqQDPGW2k/50012 THAT MEANS NO MATTER HOW MUCH TIME OR MONEY OR EFFORT WE PUT INTO IT IT WILL NEVER
trainval/jSSqQDPGW2k/50013 SO WE DID WHAT YOU DO IN SCIENCE WHEN YOU'RE NOT SURE AND WE RAN IT AGAIN
trainval/jSSqQDPGW2k/50014 SO WE RAN IT AGAIN
trainval/jSSqQDPGW2k/50015 AND WE ONLY PUBLISHED THIS A YEAR AGO BUT SINCE THEN OTHER LABS HAVE INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRMED THIS EFFECT
trainval/jSSqQDPGW2k/50016 AND LIKE I SAID WE ONLY GAVE A TINY AMOUNT OF THE DRUG AND IT LASTED FOR WEEKS AND THAT'S NOT LIKE ANYTHING YOU
trainval/jSSqQDPGW2k/50017 IT WAS TRADITIONALLY USED AS ANESTHESIA IN SURGERY
trainval/jSSqQDPGW2k/50018 5 TRILLION DOLLARS AND SINCE THEY ARE CHRONIC THAT COST IS COMPOUNDING AND IS THEREFORE
trainval/JSswZaKN2Ic/50001 THEIR BRAIN IS ON FIRE WITH YET
trainval/JSswZaKN2Ic/50002 THEY ENGAGE DEEPLY
trainval/JSswZaKN2Ic/50003 THAT HAS FAILED
trainval/JSuTsrxfYWQ/50001 SO AS A RESULT OF THAT DEMOGRAPHERS PREDICT THAT THROUGH 2025
trainval/jsZDlBU36n0/50002 I AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHY NATIONS FAIL AND WHY NATIONS SUCCEED AS WELL WHICH IS REALLY
trainval/jsZDlBU36n0/50003 I MEAN COME ON
trainval/jsZDlBU36n0/50004 DOES GREECE HAVE POLITICIANS LIKE THAT
trainval/jsZDlBU36n0/50005 IT STOPPED PEOPLE FROM COPYING HIS IDEA
trainval/jsZDlBU36n0/50006 AND THAT CREATED INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE TO INNOVATE
trainval/jsZDlBU36n0/50007 AND THROUGH OWNING A MONOPOLY A TELECOMMUNICATIONS MONOPOLY
trainval/jsZDlBU36n0/50008 LET ME SAY THAT THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON IN MEXICO IN NORTH KOREA AND ZIMBABWE
trainval/jsZDlBU36n0/50009 I'M GOING TO CALL THAT EXTRACTIVE ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS
trainval/jsZDlBU36n0/50010 SO HOW COME THE UNITED STATES ENDED UP LIKE THAT
trainval/jsZDlBU36n0/50011 OR HOW COME MEXICO IS LIKE THAT
trainval/jsZDlBU36n0/50012 AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT BOTH OF THESE EXAMPLES BOTH OF THESE ELEMENTS COME IN
trainval/jsZDlBU36n0/50013 HOW DOES GREECE FIT INTO THIS
trainval/jsZDlBU36n0/50014 I DON'T LIKE YOUR FACE
trainval/jsZDlBU36n0/50015 TO UNDERMINE THE STRONG STATE
trainval/jsZDlBU36n0/50016 THE WAY I'M TALKING NOW IS SORT OF POLITICS
trainval/jT5rRh9AZf4/50001 BECAUSE IT LEAVES US WITH THIS ALL OR NOTHING RELATIONSHIP WITH TECHNOLOGY RIGHT
trainval/jT5rRh9AZf4/50002 MY FRIENDS THINK I DO
trainval/jT5rRh9AZf4/50003 NANCY MIGHT WANT TO DISCONNECT BUT THEN SHE'D BE WORRIED
trainval/jT5rRh9AZf4/50004 WHAT IF I'M MISSING SOMETHING IMPORTANT
trainval/jT5rRh9AZf4/50005 DESIGN CAN FIX THIS PROBLEM
trainval/jT5rRh9AZf4/50006 SO WE'RE DOING TWO THINGS HERE
trainval/jT5rRh9AZf4/50007 AND THAT'S THAT WE'RE CHANGING THE QUESTION THAT WE'RE ANSWERING
trainval/jT5rRh9AZf4/50008 THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD GOAL
trainval/jT5rRh9AZf4/50009 BUT THAT WOULD KIND OF BE LIKE OUR GOAL WITH MESSAGING BEFORE WHERE WE'RE JUST TRYING TO DELIVER A MESASGE
trainval/jT5rRh9AZf4/50010 WHATEVER THAT WAS FOR THEM BY THE WAY
trainval/jT5rRh9AZf4/50011 IMAGINE YOU HAD WEB BROWSERS THAT HELPED ROUTE YOU TO THESE KINDS OF DESIGN PRODUCTS
trainval/jT5rRh9AZf4/50012 MAYBE LIKE IN MEDICINE WHERE WE HAVE A HIPPOCRATIC OATH TO RECOGNIZE THE RESPONSIBILTY AND THIS
trainval/jTfGAHroSSI/50001 WHERE WAS THE MOST OBVIOUS PLACE
trainval/JtSjYnXD83Q/50001 WE GET RAPED
trainval/JtSjYnXD83Q/50002 WE HAVE OUR PLACE
trainval/JTX0diTlUFU/50001 LIKE ROTEM I FOUND IT FASCINATING AND SPENT THE NEXT FEW WEEKS DIGGING UP INFORMATION ON MAGNETIC BACTERIA
trainval/JTX0diTlUFU/50002 WITH ROTTEN I CHANGED IMPROVED AND REFINED IT UNTIL WE GOT TO A CONCEPT
trainval/JTX0diTlUFU/50003 AND THIS ALLOWS US THE FANTASTIC ABILITY OF HAVING OUR DATA DUPLICATE ITSELF
trainval/JTX0diTlUFU/50004 WHY SPECIFICALLY MAGNETIC BACTERIA
trainval/JTX0diTlUFU/50005 WELL THEY HELP US BOTH WITH READING AND WRITING THE DATA
trainval/JTX0diTlUFU/50006 IT'S ALMOST SET IT AND FORGET IT
trainval/JTX0diTlUFU/50007 EACH OF THEM HAS ONE OR MORE CHAINS OF TINY MAGNETIC CRYSTALS CALLED MAGNETISMS
trainval/jUHE4SE3Mcg/50001 I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN PHILADELPHIA P
trainval/jUHE4SE3Mcg/50002 I'M FROM PITTSBURGH PENNSYLVANIA
trainval/jUIfiLplNqQ/50001 WE DID ABOUT 325 SHOTS
trainval/jUIfiLplNqQ/50002 AND THE SAUCE WAS CODE IN SOFTWARE THAT WE'D WRITTEN TO ALLOW THESE DISPARATE PIECES OF TECHNOLOGY TO COME
trainval/jUIfiLplNqQ/50003 SO THIS BECAME THE FOUNDATION OF OUR RESEARCH AS WE WENT FORWARD
trainval/jUIfiLplNqQ/50004 THIS WAS THE BREAKTHROUGH
trainval/jUIfiLplNqQ/50005 SO IT SEES A SMILE AS A SMILE
trainval/jv8m8rycnQs/50001 THAT FEELING OF HAPPINESS DOESN'T COME FROM THE ACTUAL MOMENT BUT INSTEAD HOW WE DECIDE TO
trainval/jv8m8rycnQs/50002 THAT'S CALLED OUR EMOTIONAL RESPONSE
trainval/jv8m8rycnQs/50003 IT'S CALLED RESPONSIBILITY
trainval/jv8m8rycnQs/50004 MY STORY TODAY IS A STORY OF RESPONSIBILITY
trainval/jv8m8rycnQs/50005 GROOMING IS HOW A CHILD'S SEX PREDATOR WEEDS OUT THE STRONG KIDS WITH HIGH SELF
trainval/jv8m8rycnQs/50006 I ALREADY HAVE A HISTORY OF DEPRESSION I'VE BEEN HOSPITALIZED FOR BEING SUICIDAL I
trainval/jv8m8rycnQs/50007 I HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FACT THAT MY ABUSE HAPPENED
trainval/jv8m8rycnQs/50008 I WAS AN INNOCENT CHILD AND THE ABUSE WAS NOT MY FAULT
trainval/jv8m8rycnQs/50009 HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE SAID OH I CAN'T
trainval/jv8m8rycnQs/50010 LET GO OF ANGER AND TOXIC PEOPLE
trainval/jv8m8rycnQs/50011 WHEN YOU TAKE RESPONSIBILITY YOU WILL HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE THE WHOLE WORLD
trainval/jvBaRf9LHDs/50001 BOOKS ARE THE TOOLS THAT RELEASE THE HEAVENS OF YOUR MIND
trainval/jvBaRf9LHDs/50002 AND LEADERS ARE READERS
trainval/jvBaRf9LHDs/50003 SO GET AROUND PEOPLE WHO CAN
trainval/jvBaRf9LHDs/50004 A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK ME DANIEL HOW DO YOU FIND THESE PEOPLE
trainval/jvBaRf9LHDs/50005 WELL I AM GLAD YOU ASKED
trainval/jvBaRf9LHDs/50006 IMAGINE IF YOU DID THIS IN EVERY AREA IN YOUR LIFE
trainval/jvBaRf9LHDs/50007 FINANCIALLY FOR PROMOTIONS FOR YOUR FAMILY AND YOU WROTE YOUR GOALS ON EVERY DAY
trainval/jVBp2nDmg7E/50001 BUT THE IMAGE THAT YOU SEE IN YOUR BRAIN AND THIS IS THE IMAGE THAT COUNTS CHANGED FOREVER
trainval/jVBp2nDmg7E/50002 BUT NEVER MIND ABOUT MAX'S BRAIN LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR OWN BRAIN
trainval/jVBp2nDmg7E/50003 IN THIS PROJECT WE ARE TRYING TO TEACH BLIND INDIVIDUALS TO SEE USING MUSIC
trainval/jVBp2nDmg7E/50004 SO ONE IS SHORT ONE IS LONGER AND PURER
trainval/jVBp2nDmg7E/50005 I WILL GIVE YOU ONE CLUE
trainval/jVBp2nDmg7E/50006 THE FIRST TWO LETTERS ARE ACTUALLY THE HI THAT YOU SAW THAT YOU SAW WITH YOUR EARS A SECOND AGO
trainval/jVBp2nDmg7E/50007 THIS IS ACTUALLY AN ILLUSION
trainval/jVBp2nDmg7E/50008 SO MAYBE THE BRAIN IS A TASK MACHINE RATHER THAN A SENSORY MACHINE
trainval/jVBp2nDmg7E/50009 NOW LET'S ADD A LITTLE SUNSHINE
trainval/jVBp2nDmg7E/50010 NOW A BLIND IN THIS CASE HAMUTAL ALSO BLIND FROM BIRTH WILL WANT TO ENTER A
trainval/jVBp2nDmg7E/50011 OK SO IF YOU MANAGED TO DO IT WELL DONE
trainval/jVBp2nDmg7E/50012 ACCORDING TO THE CLASSICAL VIEW OF HOW THE BRAIN IS ORGANIZED THE BRAIN IS A SENSORY MACHINE
trainval/jVBp2nDmg7E/50013 OF THESE HUGE NUMBER OF NEURONS ABOUT QUARTER IS DEDICATED TO VISION
trainval/jVBp2nDmg7E/50014 ARE THEY DEAD UNEMPLOYED
trainval/jVBp2nDmg7E/50015 SIT AT HOME AND WAIT
trainval/jVBp2nDmg7E/50016 OR HAVE THEY CHANGED FUNCTION
trainval/jVBp2nDmg7E/50017 THE ANSWER IS ACTUALLY QUITE SURPRISING
trainval/jVBp2nDmg7E/50018 WE CAN SEE IT IN THE NEXT MOVIE PAY ATTENTION TO THE ACTIVATION WHICH IS HIGHLIGHTED IN YELLOW
trainval/jVBp2nDmg7E/50019 AND IN SENSORY AUGMENTATION I'M TALKING ABOUT ADDING A NEW ABILITY TO THE ABILITIES THAT WE ALREADY HAVE
trainval/jVcaTtJmRNs/50001 I'M ALSO WORKING ON AN ANIMATED SERIES CALLED THE POLLINATORS
trainval/jVcaTtJmRNs/50002 IT'S ABOUT BEES AND OTHER POLLINATORS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT AND WHY THEY'RE SO IMPORTANT
trainval/jVcaTtJmRNs/50003 WHERE CAN I GET ONE
trainval/jVcaTtJmRNs/50004 WHERE ARE THEY
trainval/JvIbrDR1GSc/50001 WHAT A QUANTUM COMPUTER WOULD DO IS PUT FACTORING INTO THAT EASY CLASS
trainval/JvIbrDR1GSc/50002 SO FACTORING ALSO WOULD ONLY TAKE ABOUT N SQUARED STEPS FOR AN N DIGIT NUMBER
trainval/JvIbrDR1GSc/50003 THAT'S THE SET OF ALL THE PROBLEMS FOR WHICH A DIGITAL COMPUTER COULD AT LEAST QUICKLY RECOGNIZE AN
trainval/JvIbrDR1GSc/50004 BUT FINDING THE ANSWER MIGHT REQUIRE AN ASTRONOMICAL SEARCH
trainval/JvIbrDR1GSc/50005 IF WE WERE PHYSICISTS WE WOULD HAVE JUST CALLED THAT A LAW OF NATURE
trainval/JvIbrDR1GSc/50006 FOR NP COMPLETE PROBLEMS QUANTUM COMPUTERS SEEM TO GIVE YOU SOME ADVANTAGE LIKE
trainval/JvIbrDR1GSc/50007 EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS HAVE LIMITS
trainval/JvIbrDR1GSc/50008 BUT WHERE DO THOSE LIMITS COME FROM
trainval/JvIbrDR1GSc/50009 THAT DOES SOUND LIKE THAT WOULD CRACK THE NP COMPLETE PROBLEMS OR WHATEVER ELSE
trainval/JvIbrDR1GSc/50010 THE TROUBLE IS IT IS NOT THAT SIMPLE
trainval/JvIbrDR1GSc/50011 IF YOU JUST WANTED A RANDOM ANSWER THEN YOU COULD HAVE PICKED ONE YOURSELF WITH A LOT
trainval/JvIbrDR1GSc/50012 WELL WHY ISN'T THAT JUST A FANCY POMPOUS WAY OF SAYING THE CAT IS EITHER ALIVE
trainval/JvIbrDR1GSc/50013 NOW 50 CUBITS IS PROBABLY NOT ENOUGH YET TO DO ANYTHING
trainval/JvIbrDR1GSc/50014 OF COURSE BUT IN SOME SENSE THAT'S THE MORE EXCITING POSSIBILITY
trainval/JvIbrDR1GSc/50015 BECAUSE THAT'S THE POSSIBILITY THAT MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO REWRITE ALL THE PHYSICS TEXTBOOKS
trainval/JVwLjC5etEQ/50001 IT'S REALLY OBVIOUS
trainval/JVwLjC5etEQ/50003 JUST HANG ON
trainval/JVwLjC5etEQ/50004 IT'S BASED ON THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF WISDOM TRADITION IN ASIA
trainval/JVwLjC5etEQ/50005 HE SAID YES YES
trainval/JVwLjC5etEQ/50006 I HOPE NO ONE'S HURT
trainval/JVwLjC5etEQ/50007 WATCH IT ALL PASS MOMENT BY MOMENT
trainval/jxKUDXrtDFI/50001 HOW DID WE GET THERE
trainval/jxKUDXrtDFI/50002 WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO 2009 WHEN ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES GOT A GREAT IDEA
trainval/jxKUDXrtDFI/50003 HE CAME AT 9 A
trainval/jxKUDXrtDFI/50004 AND AFTER ALL THAT THE KNITTERS ACTUALLY FAILED TO BREAK THE WORLD RECORD
trainval/jxMvDpIeu9U/50001 WHY SHOULD WE DO THIS AS INDIANS AND PAKISTANIS
trainval/jxMvDpIeu9U/50002 WE ARE BUT TWO THREADS CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH
trainval/jxMvDpIeu9U/50003 AND IF OUR FATES ARE INTERTWINED THEN WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS GOOD KARMA IT IS GOOD
trainval/jxMvDpIeu9U/50004 GREETINGS TO ALL OF YOU FROM PAKISTAN
trainval/jxMvDpIeu9U/50005 IT FELT LIKE IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT
trainval/jYperQKUkcs/50001 AFTERWARDS MAYBE YOU CAN TELL ME WHY I DIDN'T THINK OF THIS SOONER
trainval/jYperQKUkcs/50002 AND WE WENT TO WORK
trainval/jYperQKUkcs/50003 THAT STRETCH IS CLEANER THAN IT'S BEEN IN YEARS
trainval/jYperQKUkcs/50004 I KNOW THAT I'VE LIVED THERE
trainval/jYperQKUkcs/50005 YOU INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON A WEEKNIGHT AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR SALES TOWARDS YOUR PROJECT
trainval/jYperQKUkcs/50006 WE WERE TOLD TO EXPECT BETWEEN 300 AND 400 DOLLARS
trainval/jyYjI7zQlaA/50001 HAS ITS ISSUES
trainval/jyYjI7zQlaA/50002 BUT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT L
trainval/jyYjI7zQlaA/50003 IT'S NOT A COMPETITION WITH RURAL FARM IT'S ACTUALLY REINFORCEMENTS
trainval/jyYjI7zQlaA/50004 THE SUM OF THE LOCAL IS THE GLOBAL
trainval/jyYjI7zQlaA/50005 AND READING THAT BOOK MADE ME REEXAMINE THAT THEORY BECAUSE I NEED TO EXPLAIN WHAT I MEAN BY THAT
trainval/jyYjI7zQlaA/50006 WHAT WE NEED ARE PEOPLE WHO SEE THE VALUE IN INVESTING IN THESE TYPES OF LOCAL ENTERPRISES WHO WILL
trainval/jyZAgG8SSXg/50001 AT THE ABBE MUSEUM WE WORK DAILY TO QUESTION OUR OPERATIONAL CHOICES OUR STRATEGIC
trainval/jzfV2xVsUKc/50001 AND OF COURSE THAT CROWD IS GROWING ALL THE TIME BECAUSE EVERY WEEK EVERY MONTH MORE PEOPLE WILL
trainval/jzfV2xVsUKc/50002 IF WE TAKE A BIGGER LEAP BACK IN HISTORY WE'LL SEE THAT FOR AS LONG AS THERE HAVE BEEN PUBLIC JUDICIAL
trainval/jzfV2xVsUKc/50003 GO ON AND JUMP
trainval/jzfV2xVsUKc/50004 PEOPLE HAD CLIMBED ONTO CARTS AND WAGONS IN THE STREET
trainval/jzfV2xVsUKc/50005 IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH ME
trainval/jzfV2xVsUKc/50006 THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT NOW
trainval/jzfV2xVsUKc/50007 BUT WE'RE NOT PASSIVE WHEN WE WATCH
trainval/jzfV2xVsUKc/50008 I WAS WORKING ON THE CRANIAL COLLECTIONS AND IT JUST STRUCK ME AS IRONIC THAT HERE WERE PEOPLE COMING
trainval/JzLiCBCbAMY/50001 SO IN ORDER TO PAINT THE PORTRAITS I HAD TO SPEND MORE TIME THAN PAINTING RESEARCHING READING
trainval/JzLiCBCbAMY/50002 I'M GOING TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF I WASN'T THINKING I'D BE LAUNCHING A PROJECT THAT WOULD TAKE AS OF NOW
trainval/JzLiCBCbAMY/50003 WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT
trainval/JzLiCBCbAMY/50004 THE LAW SAID THAT A WHITE PERSON COULDN'T EVEN SIT ACROSS THE AISLE FROM A BLACK PERSON BECAUSE OF THE
trainval/JzLiCBCbAMY/50005 HARRIETT WOULD NOT MOVE
trainval/JzLiCBCbAMY/50006 SHE WAS DRAGGED OFF THAT BUS SHE WAS SHOUTING THE WHOLE TIME
trainval/JzLiCBCbAMY/50007 THAT'S THE PART THE KIDS DON'T SING
trainval/JzLiCBCbAMY/50008 I WANT TO TELL ONE MORE STORY ABOUT WOODY GUTHRIE
trainval/JzLiCBCbAMY/50009 AND WOODY'S UP ON DECK AND AT LEAST IF THEY ARE HIT HE PROBABLY HAS A CHANCE
trainval/JzLiCBCbAMY/50010 WHY AREN'T THOSE MEN IN WITH THE OTHER MEN
trainval/JzLiCBCbAMY/50011 I HEAR VOICES WHO ARE THOSE PEOPLE
trainval/JzLiCBCbAMY/50012 THE CAPTAIN SAYS OH I CAN'T DO THAT
trainval/JzLiCBCbAMY/50013 WHAT DO YOU MEAN
trainval/JzLiCBCbAMY/50014 I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
trainval/JzLiCBCbAMY/50016 SO HE OPENED THE DOOR AND LET THE BLACK SOLDIERS COME IN AND SING WITH THE WHITE SOLDIERS
trainval/jZxLsDkvkVQ/50001 KNOWLEDGE BECOMES A WEIGHT UPON WISDOM
trainval/jZxLsDkvkVQ/50002 I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S HONEST
trainval/jZxLsDkvkVQ/50003 I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S TRUTHFUL
trainval/jZxLsDkvkVQ/50004 HOW DID I DO IT
trainval/k0GQSJrpVhM/50001 SO DON'T SEARCH FOR ONE DON'T WAIT FOR ONE JUST ACCEPT THE ONE YOU WERE OFFERED OR MAKE UP ONE YOURSELF AND
trainval/k0GQSJrpVhM/50002 WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME
trainval/K0PJbPlZoNI/50001 I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR STARTING THE FIRST ONLINE UNIVERSITY OUTSIDE OF THE US IN EUROPE
trainval/k0T6rfpYoqA/50001 AND IT HAS PROFOUNDLY CHANGED ME AS A PERSON
trainval/k0T6rfpYoqA/50002 BUT I WOULD OFTEN DRIFT OFF IN MIND IMAGINING BEING ON SOME GRAND ADVENTURE WITH ARAGORN OR GANDALF
trainval/k0T6rfpYoqA/50003 SORT OF LIKE A SIDEKICK I WASN'T THE MAIN CHARACTER
trainval/k0T6rfpYoqA/50004 SO I WANTED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS WORLD SO I STARTED READING THE SILMARILLION
trainval/k0T6rfpYoqA/50005 THE EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF WORK THAT TOLKIEN PUT INTO CREATING THE WORLD OF MIDDLE EARTH AND UNFORTUNATELY
trainval/k0T6rfpYoqA/50006 SO I SENT IT TO A WEBSITE
trainval/k0T6rfpYoqA/50007 AND SO I DID
trainval/k0T6rfpYoqA/50008 BUT THE FEEDBACK HAS BEEN QUITE TREMENDOUS
trainval/k1luKASSXcg/50001 SO MOST OF US GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN BEING UPRIGHT AND TENSE WHICH WE THINK IS GOOD POSTURE BUT
trainval/k1luKASSXcg/50002 THIS IS LIKE YOUR FOUNDATION
trainval/K2BES6FUAO4/50001 I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO WAIT AROUND TO GET A DAY PASS
trainval/K2BES6FUAO4/50003 AND I WAS THERE TO BE TELLING THE STORY
trainval/K2mhMzVCfhI/50001 I THINK SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE MAY HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT
trainval/K2mhMzVCfhI/50002 WE CALL IT E
trainval/K2mhMzVCfhI/50003 AND I HEAR A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT ON THE WEST COAST WHO SAY OH EL NI O IS COMING WE ARE GOING TO GET RAIN
trainval/K2mhMzVCfhI/50004 BUT AS YOU MAY HAVE DISCOVERED SOMETIMES WE SEE WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR
trainval/K2mhMzVCfhI/50005 BUT I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THIS EXAMPLE
trainval/K2mhMzVCfhI/50006 WE HAVE MANAGED TO MAKE THE NAME OF THIS THING REMARKABLY COMPLICATED
trainval/k3zZVQPaKKQ/50001 I'M 14 I'M BECOMING A JUGGLER
trainval/k4vzhweOefs/50001 SPEND AN AFTERNOON SPEND A WHOLE DAY TALK TO ANYBODY YOU WANT
trainval/k4vzhweOefs/50002 DON'T TELL US WHERE YOU ARE
trainval/k4vzhweOefs/50004 HOW DO WE EXPRESS OURSELVES
trainval/k4vzhweOefs/50005 BUT ALSO FOR GRAMMAR
trainval/k4vzhweOefs/50006 SO THAT'S A BIG PART OF WHAT WE DO
trainval/k4vzhweOefs/50007 AND PEOPLE WILL SIGN UP FOR A 45 DAY COURSE ON BUILDING A BICYCLE
trainval/k4vzhweOefs/50008 WHERE DO WE START
trainval/k4vzhweOefs/50009 ONE IT FREED OUR FIVE KIDS FROM FOLLOWING IN OUR STEPS OUR SHADOW THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT
trainval/k4vzhweOefs/50010 BECAUSE THE FIRST WHY YOU ALWAYS HAVE A GOOD ANSWER FOR
trainval/k4vzhweOefs/50011 I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SCARED TO GO
trainval/k4vzhweOefs/50012 PART OF IT WILL BE WRONG AND IT DOESN'T MATTER
trainval/k5hspA18IU0/50001 WHY IS THAT
trainval/K5PEJPSwt0k/50001 MINE WAS SHAPED BY MY DAD
trainval/K5PEJPSwt0k/50002 MY MOM HAD DIED OF CANCER AT 41
trainval/K5PEJPSwt0k/50003 LAUGHTER IS SO HEALING
trainval/K5PEJPSwt0k/50004 SO THAT WAS SORT OF THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF MY PITY PARTY
trainval/K5PEJPSwt0k/50005 WE AREN'T COPYING CELEBRITIES' LIVES
trainval/K5PEJPSwt0k/50006 WE AREN'T PERFECTING OUR LIVES
trainval/K5PEJPSwt0k/50007 WHEN I RECOVERED A LITTLE WHILE LATER I WAS STILL MINUS THE BODY PARTS BUT
trainval/K5wCfYujRdE/50001 THE GERMAN CAMP GUARDS THEY'VE GOT BORED
trainval/K5wCfYujRdE/50002 HE SAID HE HEARD SUSPICIOUS LAUGHTER
trainval/K5wCfYujRdE/50003 SO THE SITUATION SEEMED PRETTY DESPERATE
trainval/K5wCfYujRdE/50004 MARMITE IS A BREAKFAST SPREAD BELOVED OF THE BRITISH
trainval/K5wCfYujRdE/50005 I SEE IT IN OUR BUSINESS LEADERS
trainval/K5wCfYujRdE/50006 CESAR AND I TRIED TO WRITE A PIECE FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE EXPLAINING HOW THIS WORKS
trainval/K5wCfYujRdE/50007 AND PEOPLE DO TERRIBLE THINGS IN WARS
trainval/K5wCfYujRdE/50008 NEVERTHELESS ARCHIE MANAGED TO GET PERMISSION TO DO THIS
trainval/K5wCfYujRdE/50009 YOU PUT IT IN CARDBOARD BOXES
trainval/K5wCfYujRdE/50011 WE NEVER DO
trainval/K5wCfYujRdE/50013 AND IF YOU CAN'T FIND THE ANSWERS YOU MUST BE LAZY OR STUPID
trainval/K5wCfYujRdE/50014 I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO DO IT
trainval/K5wCfYujRdE/50015 WE'RE GOING TO TEST THEM OUT
trainval/k6DPjCmc3BM/50001 WHERE ARE THE KEYS TO MY FUTURE
trainval/k6DPjCmc3BM/50002 ADEQUATE HOUSING PERMANENT SOLUTIONS NOT TEMPORARY LIKE SHELTERS INDEPENDENT
trainval/k6qTwqiHnAM/50001 SO BEING A MECHANICAL ENGINEER BEING AT MIT AND HAVING LOTS OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO ME I THOUGHT I'D TRY TO DO SOMETHING
trainval/k6qTwqiHnAM/50002 IT MEETS OUR NEEDS
trainval/k6qTwqiHnAM/50003 AND THEN FINALLY TO GET THIS OUT TO THE PEOPLE IN SCALE WE TEAMED UP WITH THE LARGEST DISABILITY ORGANIZATION IN THE WORLD
trainval/k6qTwqiHnAM/50004 THE ROAD WAS TOO ROUGH
trainval/K6YCcsDQX4w/50001 SO THERE IS A LOT OF TRADITIONS THAT GO ALONG WITH IT FOR THE DANCERS FOR THE AUDIENCE AND FOR THE CITY OF NEW
trainval/K6YCcsDQX4w/50002 THAT'S ONE KIND OF BALLET
trainval/K74JqctvM2g/50001 ASTONISHINGLY THEY FOUND AN ENORMOUS INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF NEW NEURAL CONNECTIONS IN THOSE
trainval/K74JqctvM2g/50002 AND IN THE SENSE OF WHEN WE SAY TECHNOLOGIES THIS IS REALLY A BROADER SENSE THAT IT DOESN'T
trainval/K74JqctvM2g/50003 AND SO IN MANY RESPECTS TECHNOLOGICAL EVOLUTION DOES FOLLOW MANY OF THE SAME PATTERNS AS WELL
trainval/K74JqctvM2g/50004 IT'S AN INTERESTING WORD COEVOLUTION
trainval/K74JqctvM2g/50005 EXCEPT IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE IT'S ALSO GOING TO NOT ONLY RESTORE AND REPLACE LOST FUNCTION
trainval/K74JqctvM2g/50006 BUT IF THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IF OUR SURVIVAL IS AT STAKE
trainval/k7CX2JYxfE8/50001 MAKE YOU BE PART OF THE MOVIE
trainval/k7CX2JYxfE8/50002 SO IT CAN GO LIGHTING UP FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP
trainval/k7CX2JYxfE8/50003 1 2 3 THEN IT STOPS AND THEN IT GOES ALL THE WAY DOWN
trainval/k7CX2JYxfE8/50004 AND WE WERE LIKE WHY
trainval/k7CX2JYxfE8/50005 LIKE RALPH SAID
trainval/k7CX2JYxfE8/50006 WE TOOK THE LAMP BACK TO THE UNIVERSITY AND WE THOUGHT OK WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
trainval/k7djE1X16og/50001 IS THIS ALL THERE IS FOR MY LIFE
trainval/k7djE1X16og/50002 SO THAT'S WHAT I DID
trainval/k7djE1X16og/50003 I JOINED THIS VENTURE CAPITAL INCUBATOR AS A FOUNDING PARTNER
trainval/k7djE1X16og/50004 I CAN CRUSH YOU WITH A HUG
trainval/k7djE1X16og/50005 THAT DIDN'T GO OVER SO WELL
trainval/k7djE1X16og/50006 PEOPLE JUST DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT I DID
trainval/k7djE1X16og/50007 YOU KNOW HE LOOKS AT ME
trainval/k7djE1X16og/50008 AND WOMEN HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW
trainval/k7djE1X16og/50009 I THINK IT'S TIME WE TURN OVER THE TABLES
trainval/K8Dj0oSf1SA/50001 SO IT'S A VERY LOW PRESSURE ON THE SURFACE
trainval/K8Dj0oSf1SA/50002 WHERE DO WE COME FROM
trainval/K8Dj0oSf1SA/50003 THERE ARE SO MANY REALLY STRANGE THINGS OUT THERE
trainval/k8OgHJ4WXR0/50001 BUT THOSE ARE NOT SMALL PLANETS LIKE EARTH
trainval/k8OgHJ4WXR0/50002 IT REMINDS ME THAT NEARLY EVERY DAY I RECEIVE AN EMAIL OR EMAILS FROM SOMEONE WITH A
trainval/k8OgHJ4WXR0/50003 SO I BROUGHT MY TWO BIOCHEMISTRY FRIENDS AND WE WENT TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT OUR CRAZY THEORY
trainval/k8OgHJ4WXR0/50004 HOW ARE WE GOING TO FIND THESE PLANETS
trainval/k8OgHJ4WXR0/50005 WHY ARE YOU BOTHERING
trainval/k8OgHJ4WXR0/50006 AND THAT'S WHY I'M PLEASED TO TELL YOU ABOUT ALL THE ATMOSPHERES STUDIED NOW AND THIS IS REALLY A FIELD OF ITS OWN
trainval/K926HAKRFvw/50001 IF YOU STIMULATE A BIT MORE THE GAIT ACCELERATES
trainval/k9QTVIISlkg/50001 WERE PEOPLES' BELIEFS CONSISTENT WITH HOW PUBLIC POLICY WOULD IMPACT THEM
trainval/k9QTVIISlkg/50002 I FELT THAT MOST OF US AT OUR CORE ARE MODERATES
trainval/k9QTVIISlkg/50003 MOST OF US AREN'T NOT GOING TO FORGO THE LIVELIHOODS OF OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY FOR IDEOLOGY
trainval/k9QTVIISlkg/50004 HOW DOES HE DO IT WHAT DO YOU MEAN MODEL
trainval/k9QTVIISlkg/50005 THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF ECONOMIC MODELING
trainval/k9QTVIISlkg/50006 WHAT USED TO TAKE THEM MONTHS TO CREATE AND ASSESS A SINGLE POLICY THEY COULD NOW COME TO OUR
trainval/K9SQUZbAIoY/50001 WHY AM I HERE RIGHT NOW
trainval/K9SQUZbAIoY/50002 I WAS HAVING HAPPY HOUR A 20 DOLLAR BOTTLE OF WINE JUST HAVING FUN CHATTING WITH MY CO WORKERS I
trainval/K9SQUZbAIoY/50003 FREAK OUT YOU TURN THE BAR UPSIDE DOWN EVERYONE GET UP RIGHT NOW I NEED TO FIND MY PHONE
trainval/K9SQUZbAIoY/50004 NEXT DAY GET A NEW PHONE FORGET ABOUT THE OLD ONE
trainval/K9SQUZbAIoY/50005 IT'S GONE FOREVER
trainval/K9SQUZbAIoY/50006 I'M HERE FOR THE ABSOLUTE WORST REASON
trainval/K9SQUZbAIoY/50007 I KIND OF TELL MY FRIENDS ABOUT IT YOU GUYS GOTTA CHECK OUT MY PHONE
trainval/K9SQUZbAIoY/50008 THIS CRAZY THING IS HAPPENING
trainval/K9SQUZbAIoY/50009 BECAUSE I LOST MY CELL PHONE
trainval/K9SQUZbAIoY/50010 I MEAN WE ALL KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LOSE YOUR PHONE
trainval/K9SQUZbAIoY/50011 WE'RE ALWAYS LIKE WHERE'S MY PHONE WHERE'S MY PHONE
trainval/K9SQUZbAIoY/50012 5MILLION PEOPLE IN SOUTHERN CHINA AND IT'S PRETTY UNEVENTFUL UNTIL I GET ON MY LAST LEG
trainval/K9SQUZbAIoY/50013 WE TAKE A SELFIE AND WE GOT OFF THE PLANE AND I WALK TO THE BAGGAGE CLAIM
trainval/K9SQUZbAIoY/50014 WE BECAME VERY PROTECTIVE OF EACH OTHER
trainval/K9SQUZbAIoY/50015 IT ENDED LIKE A MOVIE
trainval/Ka70SHb1wFE/50001 YOUR MONEY CAN BE STOLEN
trainval/KabSmpUSYVM/50001 IT WASN'T THE BIGGEST LIVE VIDEO THAT WE HAD DONE TO DATE
trainval/KabSmpUSYVM/50002 WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS FRAMEWORK WITH OUR CONTENT CREATORS THEY INSTANTLY GET IT NO MATTER WHAT BEAT THEY COVER WHAT
trainval/KaiwGb0csas/50001 OF COURSE HE STUDIED A LOT
trainval/KaiwGb0csas/50002 HE STUDIED LAW AND PHILOSOPHY WITH GUIDANCE FROM MENTORS BUT HE ALSO REALIZED THAT BEING A LAWYER
trainval/KaiwGb0csas/50003 THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE TRUE IN TEACHING GENERAL MEDICINE NURSING AND OTHER FIELDS AND IT HAPPENS BECAUSE
trainval/KaiwGb0csas/50004 WE FOCUS ALL OUR TIME ON JUST DOING OUR JOB PERFORMING WHICH TURNS OUT NOT TO BE A GREAT WAY TO IMPROVE
trainval/KaiwGb0csas/50005 THE BEST SALESPEOPLE AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK DO ACTIVITIES WITH THE GOAL OF IMPROVEMENT
trainval/KaiwGb0csas/50006 IT VERY MUCH DOES
trainval/KaiwGb0csas/50007 WE'LL LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES
trainval/KaiwGb0csas/50008 SO THE WAY TO HIGH PERFORMANCE IS TO ALTERNATE BETWEEN THE LEARNING ZONE AND THE PERFORMANCE ZONE PURPOSEFULLY
trainval/KaiwGb0csas/50009 IT'S A SPIRAL TO EVER INCREASING CAPABILITIES BUT WE NEED TO KNOW WHEN WE SEEK TO LEARN AND WHEN WE SEEK TO
trainval/KaiwGb0csas/50010 A TIGHTROPE WALKER DOESN'T PRACTICE NEW TRICKS WITHOUT A NET UNDERNEATH AND AN ATHLETE WOULDN'T SET OUT TO FIRST TRY A NEW MOVE
trainval/KaiwGb0csas/50011 FOR EXAMPLE WE MIGHT FIND A MENTOR OR A TRUSTED COLLEAGUE WITH WHOM WE CAN EXCHANGE IDEAS OR HAVE VULNERABLE
trainval/kbAac9DxM1I/50001 WE HAVE ALREADY 3D PRINTED A 1
trainval/kbAac9DxM1I/50002 WHERE ELSE CAN WE PRINT WITH 3D PRINTING
trainval/kbAac9DxM1I/50003 WHY SHOULD I BUILD ON THE SPACE STATION
trainval/kbAac9DxM1I/50004 AND THEY HAD TO THIS WITH THE TOOLS AND THE MATERIALS THEY HAD ON THE SPACECRAFT
trainval/kbAac9DxM1I/50005 SO EXTREMELY DIFFICULT
trainval/kbAac9DxM1I/50006 WE NEED TO QUALIFY THE MATERIAL WE NEED TO QUALIFY THE PROCESS
trainval/kbAac9DxM1I/50007 BUT ALL OF THIS IS ALL HAPPENING
trainval/kbAac9DxM1I/50008 IT'S HAPPENING ALREADY
trainval/kbAac9DxM1I/50009 I WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY AND I WAS TAUGHT EXACTLY THE OTHER WAY AROUND THAT IS REMOVING MATERIAL
trainval/kbAac9DxM1I/50010 AND WE NEED TO EDUCATE PEOPLE
trainval/kbAac9DxM1I/50011 AND NOW WE HAVE A TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN ENABLE THIS
trainval/Kc0Kthyo0hU/50001 THIS PARADOXICAL EFFECT CALLED THE LANDAU DAMPING IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IN PLASMA PHYSICS
trainval/KChjQvXjk1g/50002 BUT ORNITHOLOGISTS ARE NOT THE ONLY GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ARE EXCITED ABOUT BIRDS AND BIRD CONSERVATION
trainval/KChjQvXjk1g/50003 MANY ISLANDS HAVE LOST THOSE COMPONENTS
trainval/KChjQvXjk1g/50004 WHAT IF THERE WERE A POSSIBILITY OF BRINGING BIRDS BACK FROM EXTINCTION
trainval/KChjQvXjk1g/50005 WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN
trainval/KChjQvXjk1g/50006 WE WOULD WANT TO BE SURE IN A PERFECT WORLD THAT THE CHICKS WOULD BE ABLE TO HATCH WALK AROUND AND FEED THEMSELVES
trainval/KCL8NjN7FMQ/50001 OUR CURRENT ROBOTS DON'T REALLY DO THAT
trainval/KCL8NjN7FMQ/50002 THIS IS ITS STOMACH
trainval/KCL8NjN7FMQ/50003 THAT'S FROM 40 50 YEARS AGO
trainval/KCL8NjN7FMQ/50004 BUT WE CAN'T FORCE THE MICROBES AND THEY GENERATE A SMALL AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY PER SECOND
trainval/KCL8NjN7FMQ/50005 THIS IS SLIGHTLY NEWER
trainval/KCL8NjN7FMQ/50006 IT LOOKS LIKE THE KIND OF THING WE DO
trainval/KCL8NjN7FMQ/50007 THAT CHANGES THE WAY IN WHICH WE USE ROBOTS
trainval/KCL8NjN7FMQ/50008 JUST SPREAD THEM AROUND
trainval/KCL8NjN7FMQ/50009 IT'S THE SAME PRINCIPLE
trainval/KCL8NjN7FMQ/50010 CAN YOU DO THIS
trainval/KCL8NjN7FMQ/50011 YOU CAN MAKE ROBOTS WHICH ARE BIODEGRADABLE
trainval/KCL8NjN7FMQ/50012 AND YOU CAN MAKE ARTIFICIAL MUSCLES OUT OF JELLY
trainval/KCL8NjN7FMQ/50013 WE HAVE TO PRETEND
trainval/kCOV51S7Xqg/50001 THEY HAVE TO BASICALLY MAKE SUGGESTIONS RECOMMENDATIONS AND OFFER
trainval/kCOV51S7Xqg/50002 FOR EXAMPLE TELLING THEM THIS IS CALLED A GRAPEFRUIT WHATEVER YOU'RE HOLDING RIGHT NOW
trainval/kCOV51S7Xqg/50003 AND THAT'S CALLED AN APPLE ET CETERA
trainval/KCr8s57hdzY/50001 AND WHAT ABOUT MOTHERLAND
trainval/KCr8s57hdzY/50002 SO IT WAS THE LIQUID LANDS THAT NEEDED FEMINISM AND ACTIVISM AND HUMAN RIGHTS AND
trainval/KCr8s57hdzY/50003 IT'S CALLED SYNESTHESIA
trainval/KCr8s57hdzY/50004 HE USED TO SAY WE ARE ALL GOING TO BE WALKING ON MOVING SANDS
trainval/KCr8s57hdzY/50005 AND I THINK MIX WE CAN
trainval/KCr8s57hdzY/50006 THEY CAN BE PORTABLE
trainval/kcwBHSUevxo/50001 THIS IS A PULSE OF LIGHT THAT'S ONLY ABOUT ONE WAVELENGTH OF LIGHT LONG SO IT'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF PHOTONS ALL
trainval/kcwBHSUevxo/50002 NOW IN OUR COMPANY THIS IS WHAT WE CALL THE PINKY SUCK MOMENT
trainval/KDBcoRLkut8/50001 WE OPENLY ACKNOWLEDGE IT
trainval/KDBcoRLkut8/50002 AND MY FAVORITE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS A QUESTION THAT CAME FROM THE AUDIENCE IN A REPUBLICAN DEBATE PRIOR TO THE LAST
trainval/KDBcoRLkut8/50003 BUT HE HAD A LONG LASTING INTEREST IN THE SCIENCE OF PREJUDICE AND SO WHEN A PRESTIGIOUS BRITISH SCHOLARSHIP
trainval/KDBcoRLkut8/50004 AND TO EXPLORE THIS HE DID A SERIES OF CLASSIC STUDIES WITH BRITISH ADOLESCENTS
trainval/KDBcoRLkut8/50005 AND THE THING IS THESE JUDGMENTS TEND TO BE ACCURATE
trainval/KDBcoRLkut8/50006 WE'RE VERY GOOD AT THIS SORT OF THING
trainval/KDBcoRLkut8/50007 AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT AVENUES
trainval/KDBcoRLkut8/50008 AND THAT COULD WELL HAVE BEEN A CATALYST FOR GREAT SOCIAL CHANGE
trainval/KDBcoRLkut8/50009 AND SMITH SAYS HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND
trainval/kdqUhTnAgJU/50001 BUT AT THE TIME DR
trainval/kdqUhTnAgJU/50002 AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANT J
trainval/kdqUhTnAgJU/50003 AFTER ALL IT WAS JOHN F
trainval/kdqUhTnAgJU/50004 KENNEDY AND HIS BROTHER ROBERT KENNEDY WHO KNEW ABOUT AND APPROVED THE SURVEILLANCE OF DR
trainval/kdqUhTnAgJU/50005 WE NOTICE WHEN THOSE LAWS ARE BROKEN AND THERE'S SOME OF KIND OF RAMIFICATION OR PUNISHMENT
trainval/kdqUhTnAgJU/50006 SO FUSION CENTERS ARE THESE JOINT TASK FORCES BETWEEN LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT ARE
trainval/kdqUhTnAgJU/50007 THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY AUDITED GROUPS THAT HAVE TEA PARTY
trainval/kdqUhTnAgJU/50008 BUT WHEN A PRESIDENT REPURPOSES THE POWER OF FEDERAL SURVEILLANCE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
trainval/kdqUhTnAgJU/50009 SO PLEASE JOIN ME AND LET'S GET TO WORK
trainval/kDXJhxLzmBQ/50001 COULD WE JUMP START THAT MEMORY BACK TO LIFE MAYBE EVEN PLAY WITH THE CONTENTS OF THAT MEMORY
trainval/kDXJhxLzmBQ/50002 DO I SAY HI
trainval/kDXJhxLzmBQ/50003 FIRST YOU FIND AND LABEL A MEMORY IN THE BRAIN AND THEN YOU ACTIVATE IT WITH A
trainval/kDXJhxLzmBQ/50004 AS SIMPLE AS THAT
trainval/kDXJhxLzmBQ/50005 BUT MEMORY IS NOT
trainval/kDXJhxLzmBQ/50006 IT TURNED OUT THAT ALL WE NEED TO DO IS BASICALLY TO LET THE BRAIN FORM A MEMORY AND THEN THE BRAIN WILL
trainval/kDXJhxLzmBQ/50007 SO WHENEVER A MEMORY IS BEING FORMED ANY ACTIVE CELLS FOR THAT MEMORY WILL ALSO HAVE THIS
trainval/kDXJhxLzmBQ/50008 SO WHAT IF WE COULD START OFF BY GOING INTO THE BRAIN AND JUST FINDING A SINGLE MEMORY TO BEGIN WITH
trainval/kDXJhxLzmBQ/50009 COULD WE POSSIBLY EVEN TURN IT INTO A FALSE MEMORY
trainval/kDXJhxLzmBQ/50010 SO FAR WHAT WE'VE TOLD YOU IS BASICALLY WE CAN CONTROL THIS PLAY BUTTON OF THE CLIP SO THAT WE CAN PLAY THIS VIDEO
trainval/kDXJhxLzmBQ/50011 WE'RE JUST TRYING TO CONNECT THE TWO
trainval/kDXJhxLzmBQ/50012 NOW I EVEN SEE A WORLD WHERE EDITING MEMORIES IS SOMETHING OF A REALITY BECAUSE WE'RE LIVING IN A TIME WHERE IT'S POSSIBLE TO PLUCK QUESTIONS FROM
trainval/kDXJhxLzmBQ/50013 NOW ONE DUDE IN LAB WAS EVEN ABLE TO REACTIVATE MEMORIES OF FEMALE MICE IN MALE MICE WHICH RUMOR HAS IT IS A PLEASURABLE
trainval/KE3SK9M3JjY/50001 STDS CAN CAUSE INFERTILITY AND DO CAUSE INFERTILITY IN THOUSANDS OF WOMEN EVERY YEAR
trainval/KE3SK9M3JjY/50002 AND STDS CAUSE WEIRD DISCHARGE AND BUMPS AND HERPES AND WARTS
trainval/KE3SK9M3JjY/50003 AND ALL OF THESE THINGS TOTALLY SUCK
trainval/KE3SK9M3JjY/50004 THEY'RE A LOT MORE LIKELY TO USE CONDOMS
trainval/KE3SK9M3JjY/50005 THEY'RE A LOT MORE LIKELY TO TAKE MEDICATION WHICH LOWERS THEIR VIRAL LOAD WHICH MAKES IT LESS LIKELY THAT THEY'LL TRANSMIT THE
trainval/KE3SK9M3JjY/50006 THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOUR PARENTS TEACH YOU HOW TO TALK ABOUT
trainval/KE3SK9M3JjY/50007 THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOUR FRIENDS TEACH YOU HOW TO TALK ABOUT
trainval/KE3SK9M3JjY/50008 IT'S NOT SHOWN IN MOVIES
trainval/KE3SK9M3JjY/50009 YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION UNLESS YOU JUST MAKE YOURSELF DO
trainval/KE3SK9M3JjY/50010 AND SO THE WEBSITE FEATURES TIPS AND SCRIPTS ABOUT HOW TO DO THIS AND VIDEOS THAT ACTUALLY MODEL WHAT THAT CONVERSATION LOOKS LIKE
trainval/KE3SK9M3JjY/50011 AND THAT WOULD MAKE SEX MORE AWESOME FOR EVERYBODY
trainval/KE3SK9M3JjY/50012 THEY DIED OF AIDS
trainval/kEejVSZ5mLY/50001 THEY GIVE US GREAT WEALTH BUT WE CAN NOW HAVE ALL OF THAT BUT WITHOUT THE DOWNSIDE
trainval/kEejVSZ5mLY/50002 WE CAN NOW GET SOLAR ENERGY FROM GERMANY AND HYDRO ENERGY FROM NORWAY
trainval/KElS5nZD5yc/50001 AND YOU GO TO ONE OF THESE CONVENTIONS AND SOME DUDE BUILT THE TITANIC
trainval/KElS5nZD5yc/50002 LIKE AM I INTO THIS
trainval/kFh3Q2eOZ1U/50001 I'M AN ENGINEER YOU KNOW
trainval/KfK3eKSkOQA/50001 AND I FOUND THEIR THEORY SURPRISINGLY APPLICABLE TO THE PROCESS OF LOSING WEIGHT
trainval/KfK3eKSkOQA/50002 SO OUR CAVEMEN IN THE STONE AGE DIDN'T HAVE ANY NOTICE OF COMPLEXITY HIS LIFE WAS
trainval/KfK3eKSkOQA/50003 I SHOWED THE AUDIENCE THE SAME TWO PICTURES LEAVING THE SECOND ONE TO RIGHT BEFORE THE END
trainval/KfK3eKSkOQA/50004 NO IT WAS THAT AUDIBLE SIGH OF GENUINE SURPRISE THAT I HAD HEARD WHEN SHOWING THE SECOND PICTURE THAT
trainval/KfK3eKSkOQA/50005 SO HAVE I FOUND ALL THE INGREDIENTS TO MY RECIPE OF LOSING WEIGHT AND KEEPING THE WEIGHT OFF AND
trainval/KfK3eKSkOQA/50006 I THINK THAT IN PAST FEW YEARS I HAVE FOUND OUT ABOUT QUITE A FEW THINGS THAT WORK FOR ME BUT IT'S THE FINAL
trainval/KfK3eKSkOQA/50007 I DON'T GET WHY SHE'S ON STAGE SHE'S STILL FAT
trainval/kFMZrEABdw4/50001 THEY GET NO GREAT PLEASURE FROM WHAT THEY DO
trainval/kFMZrEABdw4/50002 IN FACT ON THE CONTRARY I THINK IT'S STILL TRUE OF A MINORITY OF PEOPLE
trainval/kFMZrEABdw4/50003 CAN WE PUT YOURS ONLINE
trainval/kFMZrEABdw4/50004 BUT OUR MINDS ARE STILL HYPNOTIZED BY THEM AND WE HAVE TO DISENTHRALL OURSELVES OF SOME OF THEM
trainval/kFMZrEABdw4/50005 I DON'T MEAN THEY CAN'T THEY JUST OFTEN CHOOSE NOT TO
trainval/kFMZrEABdw4/50006 THERE ARE MANY GREAT MODELS
trainval/kFMZrEABdw4/50007 EVERYBODY WHO'S SPOKEN AT TED HAS TOLD US IMPLICITLY OR SOMETIMES EXPLICITLY A DIFFERENT STORY THAT LIFE IS
trainval/kFMZrEABdw4/50008 HE SAID AS A KID
trainval/kFMZrEABdw4/50009 IT WAS IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE CLASS AND I FELT DREADFUL
trainval/kFMZrEABdw4/50010 BUT IT'S WHAT I WANTED AND AS SOON AS I LEFT SCHOOL I APPLIED TO THE FIRE SERVICE AND I WAS ACCEPTED
trainval/kFMZrEABdw4/50013 IT WORKED OUT FOR ERIC THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING
trainval/kFX2LrNE3VI/50001 BUT WHO AM I TO JUDGE
trainval/kFX2LrNE3VI/50002 I FACE FACEBOOK MORE THAN BOOKS FACE ME HOPING TO BOOK FACE TO FACES
trainval/kFX2LrNE3VI/50003 I'M HOLDING MY DAUGHTER OVER A SKYPE CONFERENCE CALL WHILE SHE'S CRYING IN THE CRIB IN THE NEXT ROOM
trainval/khRkIVPa1Vc/50001 PLANTS CAN'T MOVE THEY'RE ANCHORED INTO THE GROUND
trainval/khRkIVPa1Vc/50002 THIS IS A HUGE ECONOMIC IMPACT
trainval/khRkIVPa1Vc/50003 THE HONEY INDUSTRY ITSELF IS A BIG INDUSTRY WITH 1
trainval/khRkIVPa1Vc/50004 SOME FOOD CROPS SUCH AS THE ALMOND CROP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IS
trainval/khRkIVPa1Vc/50005 LAST YEAR IN FACT HAD ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF COLONY LOSS IN RECORDED HISTORY WITH
trainval/khRkIVPa1Vc/50006 WE DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON BEES BUT WE'RE LOOKING INTO IT
trainval/khRkIVPa1Vc/50007 SO HONEY BEES ARE NOT AT RISK OF EXTINCTION PEOPLE LOVE HONEY BEES AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP HONEYBEES AND EXPAND THEIR
trainval/khRkIVPa1Vc/50008 SO WHAT ARE THEY
trainval/khRkIVPa1Vc/50009 SO THERE'S A RISK THAT AS THE RANGE OF PLANTS CHANGE AND AS THE RANGE OF BEES CHANGE WE COULD BE
trainval/khRkIVPa1Vc/50010 WHAT CAN WE DO
trainval/khRkIVPa1Vc/50011 WE HAVE A LOT OF TREES IN THE AREA
trainval/khRkIVPa1Vc/50012 SO IF WE CAN MAINTAIN THOSE TREE POPULATIONS PLANT MORE WE'RE CREATING HABITAT FOR BEES
trainval/khRkIVPa1Vc/50013 I HOPE THAT YOU HAVE BECOME MORE INTERESTED IN BEES IN THIS TIME
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50001 AND HE'S BEEN BY MY SIDE EVER SINCE
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50002 WILSON WITH ME
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50003 AND THEN I WENT ON TO COLLEGE AND OBVIOUSLY PLAYED COLLEGE BASKETBALL
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50004 THEY'RE SUPERHUMAN THESE MEN AND WOMEN
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50005 I ACTUALLY HAD A FRONT ROW SEAT
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50006 WILSON AND I REALIZED IT'S REALLY NOT
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50007 IT'S ABOUT A COMPETITIVE MINDSET
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50008 AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50009 SOME TWO KEY POINTS THAT WE SAW THAT MAYBE YOU COULD USE IN YOUR DAILY LIFE OR IN YOUR
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50010 LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50011 BEFORE I SHOT A FREE THROW I WOULD ACTUALLY AND YOU CAN TAKE THE TIME IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW WITH ME IS
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50012 EVEN JORDAN SPIETH THE NUMBER ONE GOLFER IN THE WORLD YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD NOW WITH TECHNOLOGY THEIR
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50013 MICHAEL GELLER WOULD SAY TO JORDAN SPIETH PAINT A PICTURE
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50014 WELL WHAT HE'S SAYING IS LOOK AT THE FLIGHT OF THE BALL
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50015 HOW IS IT GOING TO REACT
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50016 WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WERE IN THAT SITUATION
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50017 WELL HE DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE UP HOPE
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50019 SO WHAT HE WOULD DO FOR FOUR HOURS IS PLAY HIS GOLF COURSE BACK HOME
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50020 HE WOULD FEEL THE WIND ON HIS BACK AND HE WOULD KEEP ON WALKING ALONG
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50021 BUT HE DID THIS EVERY DAY
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50022 WHAT DO YOU THINK HE DID WHEN HE CAME BACK AFTER NOT TOUCHING A CLUB FOR SEVEN AND A HALF YEARS
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50023 THIS IS A MORE POWERFUL TOOL THAT WE CAN USE IN OUR DAILY LIVES
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50024 IF YOU'RE GOING TO A JOB INTERVIEW VISUALIZE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE JOB INTERVIEW
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50025 WILSON AND I HAVE BEEN FRIENDS FOR A LONG TIME
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50026 HOW MANY OF YOU WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50027 A LOT OF US WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50028 PUT ON THE DRESS SEE YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50029 EAT THE FOOD THAT YOU NEED TO DO BECAUSE WHEN YOU COME BACK YOU'VE ALREADY CREATED AN IMPRINT OF WHAT
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50030 ONE OF THE TENETS IS
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50031 GET OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50032 THINK ABOUT HOW HARD THAT COULD BE
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50033 THAT IS WHAT MAKES DELIBERATE PRACTICE SO DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT'S TEDIOUS AND PAINFUL
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50034 BUT IF YOU DO IT YOU'LL BE SUCCESSFUL IN WHAT YOU WANT TO ACCOMPLISH
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50035 AND THEN YOUR CHOICES AND YOUR DECISIONS ARE ALL BASED UPON WHAT YOU HAVE JUST DETERMINED
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50036 THE OTHER IS DELIBERATE PRACTICE
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50037 WHAT DELIBERATE PRACTICE IS IS USING SOMETHING IN YOUR FUNDAMENTALS TO BUILD UPON
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50038 AND THE THIRD PART IS
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50039 SO THEY'RE ALWAYS BREAKING DOWN NEW BARRIERS
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50040 THEY'RE ALWAYS CREATING NEW CHALLENGES FOR THEMSELVES
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50041 THEY'RE ALWAYS ABOUT WINNING
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50042 AND A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY WINNING
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50043 NO IT'S NOT ABOUT VANQUISHING AN OPPONENT
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50044 NOW THERE'S A LADY THAT INSPIRED ME AND IT WAS A TREMENDOUS STORY
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50045 AND I WANT TO KNOW
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50046 AND BOY DID SECRETARIAT RUN HIS RACE
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50047 HE SAID I WAS HERE FOR A RIDE
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50048 BUT GUESS WHAT
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50049 HE KEPT ON GOING
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50050 AND HE SAID IT WAS LIKE A LOCOMOTIVE GOING DOWN THE BACK STRETCH AND AROUND THE
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50051 THAT'S UNHEARD OF IN HORSE RACING
trainval/KI3WJXNhCJ8/50052 THAT'S TWO SECONDS
trainval/kiDfwUQySEs/50001 HOW COULD HE ABANDON HIS FAMILY HIS COMMUNITY
trainval/kiDfwUQySEs/50002 SO HERE I AM IN SPIRIT
trainval/kiDfwUQySEs/50003 TO DATE MY MOTHER MUST HAVE TAKEN CARE OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS OUR ENTIRE
trainval/kiDfwUQySEs/50004 WHEN I WAS TWO MY PARENTS WANTING TO GIVE MY BROTHER AND I A PROPER EDUCATION DECIDED THAT THEY WOULD MOVE
trainval/kiDfwUQySEs/50005 I WAS LOOKING THROUGH THE LENS OF MY CAMERA
trainval/kiDfwUQySEs/50006 NOT JUST IN PAKISTAN BUT IN THE WORLD
trainval/kiDfwUQySEs/50007 WITH NO PROPER SCHOOLS AROUND WE WERE HOMESCHOOLED MUCH OF OUR LIVES
trainval/kiDfwUQySEs/50008 AND THE FIRE BURNT HARD
trainval/kiDfwUQySEs/50009 MY BROTHER MADE HIS WAY TO STANFORD
trainval/kiDfwUQySEs/50010 THINK ABOUT IT
trainval/kiDfwUQySEs/50011 I ASKED WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP
trainval/kiDfwUQySEs/50012 WHILE OUR STRINGS CAN HOLD US BACK OUR STRINGS CAN ALSO GIVE US DIRECTION
trainval/kiDfwUQySEs/50013 OUR STRINGS ARE WHAT CAN LIGHT THE BRIGHTEST FIRE WITHIN US
trainval/kiDfwUQySEs/50014 AS HE WAS STARTING HIS LIFE AT HARVARD HIS ENTIRE WORLD CHANGED AROUND HIM IN A MATTER OF DAYS
trainval/kiDfwUQySEs/50015 HE WAS GIVEN ROUGHLY 1000 DAYS TO LIVE
trainval/kiDfwUQySEs/50016 AND DEVISED A PLAN AGAINST THEM
trainval/kiDfwUQySEs/50017 KIDS ALL OVER THE ENDS OF PAKISTAN WERE DREAMING BIG AUDACIOUS DREAMS OF BECOMING
trainval/kiDfwUQySEs/50018 HE STRETCHED THOSE STRINGS FAR AND WIDE AND HE CHALLENGED THEM JUST AS MUCH AS HIS STRINGS
trainval/kiDfwUQySEs/50019 THE KID WITH THE PIERCING EYES WITH THE SLIGHT HESITATION IN HIS VOICE LOOKED AT ME AND HE SAID
trainval/kiDfwUQySEs/50020 I TOOK THEIR PICTURES SO I WOULD ALWAYS REMEMBER THEM AND I ASKED THEM WHAT THEY WANTED TO BE WHEN THEY GROW UP
trainval/kiDfwUQySEs/50021 IN THAT MOMENT I FELT I ALONE BORE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO TOUCH THIS ONE KID'S
trainval/kiDfwUQySEs/50022 THIS WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY THIS WAS MY OPPORTUNITY
trainval/kiDfwUQySEs/50023 INSTEAD IF EACH OF US EMBRACED OUR STRINGS NOT SO THAT WE CAN BE TIED DOWN BY THEM BUT SO WE CAN
trainval/kiDfwUQySEs/50024 WITH THE SUPPORT OF AN AMAZING GROUP OF FRIENDS COLLEAGUES AND PARTNERS WE FORMED OUR ORGANIZATION THE
trainval/kiDfwUQySEs/50025 A TINY DROP IN A COSMIC OCEAN YES BUT SOMETIMES ONE DROP IS ALL IT TAKES TO
trainval/kiDfwUQySEs/50026 WHAT IF WE COULD QUESTION THEM CHALLENGE THEM RESHAPE AND REFORM THEM
trainval/kiDfwUQySEs/50027 I KNEW THE CHILDREN OF AKRI DREAMED THE SAME DREAMS I DID AND WE SHARED THE SAME STRINGS
trainval/KIKqRFZ3r1I/50001 THEY WERE ALL YOUNGER THAN ME
trainval/KIKqRFZ3r1I/50002 AND THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE HIGHLIGHT OF THIS WHOLE THING I TALK ABOUT
trainval/KIKqRFZ3r1I/50003 BUT COMPLETELY NECESSARY
trainval/KIMWfSe7ZJI/50001 I LOVE BEING A POLICE OFFICER BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A CALLING FOR ME AND NEVER A JOB
trainval/KIMWfSe7ZJI/50002 I WAS JUST SO TIRED
trainval/KIMWfSe7ZJI/50003 WE SAID THIS IS YOUR COMMUNITY TABLE
trainval/KIMWfSe7ZJI/50004 AND STOP THAT
trainval/KIMWfSe7ZJI/50005 BUT I SAY THIS
trainval/KIMWfSe7ZJI/50006 WE BEGAN TO DEAL WITH OUR YOUTH AND WITH THOSE WHO WE CONSIDER ARE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE FENCE
trainval/KIMWfSe7ZJI/50007 IT WAS THOSE GUARDIANS IT WAS THAT VILLAGE MENTALITY
trainval/KIMWfSe7ZJI/50008 THEY CAME AND SAID STOP THAT
trainval/KIMWfSe7ZJI/50009 AND DO THIS
trainval/KiPcxhJtuPQ/50001 AND YEARS AFTER I LEFT COVENANT HOUSE HE WAS STILL WORKING THERE
trainval/kiUnJ1d8vvw/50001 HOW DID THEY MAKE THEM
trainval/kiUnJ1d8vvw/50002 WE THINK WE ALREADY KNOW HOW SOMETHING WORKS SO WE CAN'T IMAGINE HOW IT COULD WORK
trainval/kiUnJ1d8vvw/50003 I RAN THESE WORKSHOPS EVERYWHERE
trainval/kiUnJ1d8vvw/50004 I WAS THERE
trainval/kiUnJ1d8vvw/50005 BUT IT'S ALSO VERY SERIOUS BECAUSE ALL THIS ACCESSIBILITY STUFF STARTED COMING UP WHERE PEOPLE CAN'T USE
trainval/kiUnJ1d8vvw/50006 AND THAT'S THE WORLD I REALLY WANT TO LIVE IN
trainval/KIysMV9wbVY/50001 WELL I'M GOING TO STAY IN THE UNIVERSITY
trainval/KIysMV9wbVY/50002 COME JOIN ME
trainval/KIysMV9wbVY/50003 I'M GOING TO BE AN HONEST LAWYER
trainval/KIysMV9wbVY/50004 THEN I THOUGHT WHY NOT
trainval/KIysMV9wbVY/50005 I'M GOING TO TRY
trainval/KJ3lcCa0G4Y/50001 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/kj9HYBDSknQ/50001 AND UNLESS THINGS CHANGE BY 2050 RESISTANT INFECTIONS WILL KILL MORE
trainval/kj9HYBDSknQ/50002 THE SAME STUDIES COULD BE DONE IN THE US FOR PATIENTS WITH MENINGITIS OR INFLUENZA
trainval/kj9HYBDSknQ/50003 I BELIEVE WE ARE POISED FOR A REVOLUTION IN HOW WE DIAGNOSE AND TREAT INFECTIONS NOT JUST IN THE US BUT
trainval/kj9HYBDSknQ/50004 SO THERE IS SOME DANGER THAT WHEN I TELL YOU THAT ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE IS ONE OF THE GREATEST THREATS TO
trainval/KjKBOo5tFX8/50001 6 TRILLION DOLLARS IN SIZE
trainval/kjmsb9pDrF0/50001 HOW TO TACKLE HOMOPHOBIA
trainval/Kk7kzUt3SLc/50001 SO AS A CHILD I READ VORACIOUSLY I LOVED TO READ
trainval/Kk7kzUt3SLc/50002 AND AS I CONTINUED MY STUDIES WHAT I REALIZED IS THAT THOSE CAMPS OF THOUGHT WERE VERY MUCH
trainval/Kk7kzUt3SLc/50003 ONCE WE GET RID OF THE DISEASE WE'RE HEALED
trainval/Kk7kzUt3SLc/50004 SO AS I DUG DEEPER WHAT I REALIZED IS THAT WHAT IS BEING CALLED COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE HERE IN THE
trainval/Kk7kzUt3SLc/50005 THESE ARE MEDICINES LIKE TIBETAN MEDICINE AYURVEDIC MEDICINE AND CHINESE
trainval/Kk7kzUt3SLc/50006 THE THREAD THAT TIES ALL OF THESE FORMS OF COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE TOGETHER WERE THE SAME THINGS THAT
trainval/Kk7kzUt3SLc/50007 PLACEBO'S ACTUALLY MADE UP OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS
trainval/Kk7kzUt3SLc/50008 BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT PLACEBO DOESN'T SEEM TO JUST APPLY TO COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE
trainval/Kk7kzUt3SLc/50009 IT ALSO APPLIES TO MODERN MEDICINE AS WELL
trainval/Kk7kzUt3SLc/50010 IS IT THE BIOCHEMICAL MOLECULAR MODEL CAMP OR IS IT THE COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE CAMP
trainval/kKeUISJko3o/50001 MAYBE THAT POWER UNDERLIES THE WAY YOU THINK OVERALL
trainval/kKeUISJko3o/50002 WHAT ABOUT IT
trainval/kKeUISJko3o/50003 AND YOU CAN WRITE THAT CODE DOWN
trainval/kKeUISJko3o/50004 OF HUMAN INTELLIGENCE IS A VISUAL TEST
trainval/kKeUISJko3o/50005 IT'S THE RAVEN'S TEST
trainval/KkYuhwr3esg/50001 SHOULD WE MEET NOW
trainval/KkyzYjPuxK8/50001 WE EXPERIENCE WHAT SHE CALLED THE CHOICE OVERLOAD PROBLEM
trainval/KkyzYjPuxK8/50003 IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE ARCHERY
trainval/kLIfeGflNp8/50001 FIRST WHY IS THE CURRENT SYSTEM NOT WORKING
trainval/kLIfeGflNp8/50002 BUT TODAY THAT SYSTEM IS FAILING
trainval/kLIfeGflNp8/50003 IN THEORY REFUGEES HAVE A RIGHT TO SEEK ASYLUM
trainval/kLIfeGflNp8/50004 IN THEORY REFUGEES HAVE A RIGHT TO A PATHWAY TO INTEGRATION OR RETURN TO THE COUNTRY THEY'VE COME
trainval/kLIfeGflNp8/50005 EDUCATION IS OFTEN OF POOR QUALITY
trainval/kLIfeGflNp8/50006 I THINK WE CAN RECONSIDER THAT CHOICE
trainval/kLIfeGflNp8/50007 KING ABDULLAH HAS PICKED UP ON THE IDEA
trainval/kLIfeGflNp8/50008 IT COULD ALSO BE USED AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL WHERE ONE OF THE GREAT CHALLENGES WE FACE IS TO PERSUADE LOCAL
trainval/kLIfeGflNp8/50009 IF WE ALLOWED REFUGEES TO DO THAT IT WOULD HAVE MAJOR ADVANTAGES
trainval/kLIfeGflNp8/50010 IT GIVES THEM THE RIGHT TO WORK
trainval/kLIfeGflNp8/50011 IT GIVES THEM FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT
trainval/kLIfeGflNp8/50012 WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN EUROPE WILL BE WITH US FOR MANY YEARS
trainval/klLtDoVkZ98/50001 WE CAN SEE THAT WITH GLOBALIZATION THE QUESTION WHERE ARE YOU FROM
trainval/kLRanIhp2jg/50001 THEY DID ALL THAT AND IT DIDN'T WORK
trainval/kLRanIhp2jg/50002 THIS IS HOW IT WAS IN MEIJI
trainval/kLRanIhp2jg/50003 EVERYTHING LOOKS FINE
trainval/kLRanIhp2jg/50004 OH THEY'RE GOING TO IYA BUT WHY
trainval/kLRanIhp2jg/50005 AND OF COURSE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE COME TO IYA FOR
trainval/kLRanIhp2jg/50006 THERE IS A NEW INDUSTRY FOR THESE PLACES
trainval/kLRanIhp2jg/50007 IT'S THERE AND IT CAN BE SAVED
trainval/kLRanIhp2jg/50008 AND I THINK WE FOUND THE WAY TO GO FORWARD
trainval/klUoJxGv9wg/50001 A LOT OF THINGS ARE GOING THROUGH YOUR HEAD
trainval/klUoJxGv9wg/50002 FOR ME IT WAS MOSTLY OUTRAGE
trainval/klUoJxGv9wg/50003 I WAS JUST OUTRAGED THAT HOW COME THIS IS THE BEST THAT WE CAN OFFER
trainval/klUoJxGv9wg/50004 AND I STARTED LOOKING MORE AND MORE INTO THIS
trainval/klUoJxGv9wg/50005 IT'S NOT JUST THE BEST DOCTORS COULD OFFER PATIENTS WITH BRAIN CANCER GENERALLY
trainval/klUoJxGv9wg/50006 WE'RE ACTUALLY NOT DOING THAT WELL ALL ACROSS THE BOARD WITH CANCER
trainval/klUoJxGv9wg/50007 I DON'T THINK WE QUITE WON THIS WAR YET AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE HERE WILL QUESTION THAT
trainval/klUoJxGv9wg/50008 HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ONE OF THE MOST DEADLY FORMS OF BRAIN CANCER
trainval/klUoJxGv9wg/50009 AND ALL YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS PATIENT IS THAT THERE'S A TUMOR ABOUT THE SIZE OF A GOLF BALL OR SO IN THE RIGHT FRONTAL LOBE OF THIS
trainval/klUoJxGv9wg/50010 AND THAT'S MORE OR LESS IT
trainval/km4GiwSIFCo/50001 SO I WENT TO THE ART ACADEMY IN LATVIA AND ASKED AN ARTIST
trainval/km4GiwSIFCo/50002 PLEASE STOP SENDING IN THOSE PICTURES OF DOGS IT'S NOT ABOUT THIS
trainval/KM4Xe6Dlp0Y/50001 I AM ON THIS STAGE BECAUSE I AM A PRETTY WHITE WOMAN AND IN MY INDUSTRY WE CALL THAT A SEXY GIRL
trainval/KM4Xe6Dlp0Y/50002 BUT UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE TO INFORM YOU THAT IN 2007 A VERY INSPIRED NYU PH
trainval/KM4Xe6Dlp0Y/50003 STUDENT COUNTED ALL THE MODELS ON THE RUNWAY EVERY SINGLE ONE THAT WAS HIRED AND OF THE
trainval/KM4Xe6Dlp0Y/50004 YOU CAN BE ANYTHING
trainval/KM4Xe6Dlp0Y/50005 THAT'S NOT ME
trainval/KM4Xe6Dlp0Y/50006 WHEN WILL I GET STOPPED
trainval/KM4Xe6Dlp0Y/50007 BUT MOSTLY IT WAS DIFFICULT TO UNPACK A LEGACY OF GENDER AND RACIAL OPPRESSION WHEN I AM
trainval/KM4Xe6Dlp0Y/50008 IF THERE'S A TAKEAWAY TO THIS TALK I HOPE IT'S THAT WE ALL FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE ACKNOWLEDGING THE
trainval/kmflTZnRuZI/50001 HOW DO WE KNOW THIS
trainval/kmflTZnRuZI/50002 IT'S JUST WHAT WE'RE MADE OUT OF
trainval/kmflTZnRuZI/50003 THAT'S WHAT DRIVES US THAT'S HOW WE SURVIVE
trainval/kmflTZnRuZI/50004 WE'VE DEVELOPED METHODS OVER TIME
trainval/kmflTZnRuZI/50005 BUT THAT NEVER STOPPED US
trainval/kmflTZnRuZI/50006 THAT PARTICLE GETS ITS MASS BY INTERACTING WITH THE HIGGS BOSON
trainval/kmflTZnRuZI/50007 WE MAKE A WHOLE BUNCH OF THESE THINGS
trainval/kmflTZnRuZI/50008 IT'S NOT AT ALL THE CASE
trainval/kmflTZnRuZI/50009 WHICH ONE OF THESE ENIGMAS HAS ALREADY BEEN SOLVED
trainval/kmflTZnRuZI/50010 THEREFORE IF WE CAN MEASURE THAT PARTICLE VERY CAREFULLY MAYBE WE CAN SOLVE THIS
trainval/kmflTZnRuZI/50011 THERE'S A KEY HERE
trainval/kmflTZnRuZI/50012 THERE'S SOMETHING THAT CAN HELP US OUT
trainval/kmflTZnRuZI/50013 SO LET'S SOLVE THIS OK
trainval/kmflTZnRuZI/50014 ANYBODY KNOW HEISENBERG
trainval/kmflTZnRuZI/50015 WE'VE GOT THAT HIGGS BOSON
trainval/kmflTZnRuZI/50016 IT'LL BE SOMETHING THAT WILL CHANGE IT
trainval/kmflTZnRuZI/50017 WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND SOMETHING THIS YEAR
trainval/kmflTZnRuZI/50018 BUT YOU HAVE TO EXPLORE EXPLORE EXPLORE
trainval/kMfPyytHwU4/50001 AT THAT TIME IT WAS BEFORE THE PROLIFERATION OF VIDEO
trainval/kMfPyytHwU4/50002 NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE WATCHING THE TALKS
trainval/kMfPyytHwU4/50003 SO AT THE TIME CHRIS AND I SAT DOWN TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO REALLY TAKE THE TED BRAND AND OPEN SOURCE IT IN A
trainval/kMfPyytHwU4/50004 SO OUT OF THAT THE TEDX PROGRAM WAS BORN
trainval/kMfPyytHwU4/50005 SO REALLY TEDX IS YOUR PROGRAM
trainval/kmNxhFFZWpM/50001 WE WERE A JOKE
trainval/kmNxhFFZWpM/50002 JUST ENOUGH TO GET RID OF INFLATION THEN EVERYTHING WOULD BE GOOD AGAIN
trainval/kmNxhFFZWpM/50003 WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY ALLOWS A SITUATION TO GET SO HARD THAT CANNOT GET ITS ACT TOGETHER
trainval/kmNxhFFZWpM/50004 AND WE LEARNED THROUGH THEM
trainval/kmNxhFFZWpM/50005 THEY JUST GOT TOGETHER
trainval/Kn5JRgz3W0o/50001 HE'D BEEN A MINER
trainval/Kn5JRgz3W0o/50002 IT WAS IN THE FOOTBALL GROUND
trainval/Kn5JRgz3W0o/50003 BUT SHE WAS REALLY AMAZED
trainval/Kn5JRgz3W0o/50004 SHE ALWAYS FELT A LITTLE BIT OF AN OUTSIDER ALTHOUGH SHE'S BEEN THERE ALMOST ALL HER LIFE A WOMAN OF RUSSIAN
trainval/Kn5JRgz3W0o/50005 SOME OF THE GUYS USED TO VERY HEAVY JOBS SAID I DON'T WANT TO BE A VICTIM
trainval/Kn5JRgz3W0o/50006 YOU HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO KNOW
trainval/Kn5JRgz3W0o/50007 YOU CAN SEE WILLFUL BLINDNESS IN BANKS WHEN THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SOLD MORTGAGES TO PEOPLE
trainval/Kn5JRgz3W0o/50008 EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF PEOPLE KNOW THERE'S A PROBLEM BUT THEY WON'T SAY ANYTHING
trainval/Kn5JRgz3W0o/50009 SO THERE'S THIS PROFOUND MYTHOLOGY AROUND WHISTLEBLOWERS WHICH SAYS FIRST OF ALL
trainval/Kn5JRgz3W0o/50010 AND HE SAID YOU KNOW I'M NOT THE KIND OF GUY TO RAT PEOPLE OUT BUT SOME
trainval/Kn5JRgz3W0o/50011 AND WHAT THEY'RE VERY PREPARED TO DO IS RECOGNIZE THAT YES THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ARGUMENT
trainval/KnCqR2yUXoU/50003 THIS IS A KIND OF A BLOWING STRAW
trainval/kNhyOYv2ejw/50001 WE REALLY LIVED EVERYTHING WE DID
trainval/kNhyOYv2ejw/50002 LET'S TRY TO SLOW DOWN TIME TRY TO EXPAND TIME TRY TO CREATE TIME
trainval/kNhyOYv2ejw/50003 TIME FLOWS THROUGH YOUR AND MY BRAIN JUST LIKE WATER THROUGH A GARDEN HOSE
trainval/kNhyOYv2ejw/50004 SAME GOES FOR YOUR BRAIN
trainval/kNhyOYv2ejw/50005 SOMEHOW OUR BRAINS ARE CONTRACTING
trainval/kNhyOYv2ejw/50006 THEY'RE ACTUALLY CAUSING TIME TO GO FASTER
trainval/kNhyOYv2ejw/50007 WHY IS THIS
trainval/kNhyOYv2ejw/50008 LET ME SHOW YOU WHY
trainval/kNhyOYv2ejw/50009 AND IT WAS ABOUT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE THAT MY OBSESSION WITH TIME MORPHED
trainval/kNhyOYv2ejw/50011 THERE'S A RANGE BUT APPROXIMATELY AROUND THE SAME PLACE
trainval/kNhyOYv2ejw/50012 NO THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS CHRONOLOGICAL TIME
trainval/kNhyOYv2ejw/50013 EVERYTHING WAS NEW
trainval/kNhyOYv2ejw/50014 AND THEY HAVE AN INCREDIBLE DEPTH OF EXPERIENCE
trainval/kNhyOYv2ejw/50015 MAYBE YOU TAKE A HALF DAY AT WORK
trainval/kNhyOYv2ejw/50016 AND SUMMERS LAST FOREVER
trainval/kNhyOYv2ejw/50017 HOW DO YOU MAXIMIZE THE SECOND LAW OF EXPERIENTIAL TIME
trainval/kNhyOYv2ejw/50018 E MC2 EVERYBODY IS FAMILIAR WITH THIS FORMULA THE LAW OF RELATIVITY
trainval/kNhyOYv2ejw/50019 TRADE AWESOME DAY FOR A BORING WEEK
trainval/kNhyOYv2ejw/50020 HE SAID GOODBYE TO THEM WHILE HE SHARED WITH THEM THE MEANING THAT THEY HAD HAD IN HIS LIFE
trainval/KNXOVpN8Wgg/50001 THEN APPLE RELEASED THE ALEX VOICE WHICH WAS THE BEST I'D HEARD
trainval/KNXOVpN8Wgg/50002 IT KNEW THINGS LIKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN EXCLAMATION POINT AND A QUESTION MARK
trainval/KNXOVpN8Wgg/50003 THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF HTML CODES YOU CAN USE TO CONTROL THE TIMING AND INFLECTION OF COMPUTER VOICES AND I'VE
trainval/KNXOVpN8Wgg/50004 THERE WAS SOMETHING COMFORTING ABOUT A VOICE THAT WAS NOT MY OWN
trainval/KNXOVpN8Wgg/50005 ALL OF THEIR VOICES HAD BEEN MADE BY A SPEAKER RECORDING ORIGINAL WORDS IN A CONTROL BOOTH
trainval/KNXOVpN8Wgg/50006 SO I SENT THEM MANY HOURS OF RECORDINGS OF MY VOICE INCLUDING SEVERAL AUDIO COMMENTARY TRACKS THAT I'D MADE FOR MOVIES
trainval/KNXOVpN8Wgg/50007 IRONIC THAT MY LEGS ARE FINE AND IT'S MY SHOULDERS THAT SLOW UP MY WALK
trainval/KNXOVpN8Wgg/50008 ONE OF THE FUNNIEST BLOGS ON THE WEB IS WRITTEN BY A FRIEND OF MINE NAMED SMARTASS
trainval/ko32Hr1SoPc/50001 AND THEY BOTH ARE BLIND
trainval/ko32Hr1SoPc/50002 SO THEY ARE VERY BRAVE
trainval/KOIsqRgJ3XM/50001 OR IN OTHER WORDS WHAT ROOM IN MY HOUSE
trainval/koOpvazE9VQ/50001 OH AND YOU FATHERS OUT THERE
trainval/kOPMqiKhoSc/50001 HANDS ON HEARTS HOW MUCH FOOD DO YOU THINK YOU'RE THROWING
trainval/kOPMqiKhoSc/50002 NOW THAT WAS YOU AT YOUR HOUSE
trainval/kOPMqiKhoSc/50003 BUT WHY IS IT THAT IT'S SUCH A HUGE PROBLEM
trainval/kOPMqiKhoSc/50004 LET'S WATCH THIS TOGETHER
trainval/kOPMqiKhoSc/50005 WHERE IS THE PROBLEM
trainval/kOPMqiKhoSc/50006 YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FOOD
trainval/kOPMqiKhoSc/50007 SO IT S TIME TO WAKE UP AND CHANGE
trainval/kOPMqiKhoSc/50008 YOU GO SEARCH FOR THE INGREDIENTS ACCORDINGLY
trainval/kOPMqiKhoSc/50009 IT'S NOT FOOD FROM THE GARBAGE
trainval/kOPMqiKhoSc/50010 SO WE TOOK IT FROM THE SELLERS AND WE STARTED WORKING AND COOKING
trainval/kOPMqiKhoSc/50011 SO WHAT DID WE DO
trainval/kOPMqiKhoSc/50012 AND THE FOOD SYSTEM IS A GOOD PLACE TO START WITH
trainval/kOPMqiKhoSc/50013 BUT AT THE SAME WHILE WE ARE BLIND TO MANY THINGS AND WE DON'T SEE
trainval/kOPMqiKhoSc/50014 NOW IMAGINE WHAT YOU COULD BE DOING WITH THE MONEY THAT YOU JUST WASTED
trainval/KOtFDsC8JC0/50001 EVERY TIME WE SEND OUT A TEXT MESSAGE WE GET BACK A FEW DOZEN TEXT MESSAGES HAVING
trainval/KOtFDsC8JC0/50002 AND IN FOUR MONTHS WE WERE IN ALL 295 AREA CODES IN AMERICA
trainval/KOtFDsC8JC0/50003 I HAVE A BOTTLE OF PILLS ON THE DESK IN FRONT OF ME
trainval/KOtFDsC8JC0/50004 SO SHE GETS THE ADDRESS AND THE COUNSELOR TRIGGERS AN ACTIVE RESCUE WHILE THEY'RE TEXTING BACK AND FORTH
trainval/KOtFDsC8JC0/50005 41 ACTIVE RESCUES A DAY
trainval/KOtFDsC8JC0/50006 WE CAN DO THINGS LIKE PREDICTIVE WORK
trainval/KOtFDsC8JC0/50007 AND WE'RE NOT HOMOPHOBIC
trainval/KOtFDsC8JC0/50008 ARE YOU SURE HE DIDN'T GRADUATE IN THE BOTTOM 10 PERCENT
trainval/KOtFDsC8JC0/50009 IT WAS SAD TO SEE AN ICON A FUNNYMAN COMMIT SUICIDE AND THERE WERE THREE HOUR WAIT TIMES ON
trainval/KOtFDsC8JC0/50010 THE DIFFERENCE WAS IF YOU TEXT US I WANT TO DIE OR I WANT TO KILL MYSELF THE ALGORITHM
trainval/KOtFDsC8JC0/50011 THINK ABOUT IT THOSE 6
trainval/KOtFDsC8JC0/50012 5 MILLION MESSAGES AUTO TAGGING THROUGH NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSES ALL OF THESE DATA POINTS
trainval/KOtFDsC8JC0/50013 AND IT'S IN A PLACE CALLED CRISISTRENDS
trainval/KOtFDsC8JC0/50014 AND I WANT FAMILIES TO SEE THAT SUBSTANCE ABUSE QUESTIONS SPIKE AT 5AM
trainval/KOtFDsC8JC0/50015 I WANT SOMEBODY TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE NATIVE AMERICAN RESERVATIONS IN MONTANA
trainval/KOtFDsC8JC0/50016 I DON'T THINK OF MYSELF AS A MENTAL HEALTH ACTIVIST
trainval/KoXdjyJyxbE/50001 WHERE DO THESE IMPRESSIONS OF TODAY'S YOUNG PEOPLE COME FROM
trainval/KoXdjyJyxbE/50002 I COULD BRING THEM OUT HERE
trainval/KoXdjyJyxbE/50003 YOU ALL KNOW THE RESPONSE
trainval/KoXdjyJyxbE/50004 COULD YOU IMAGINE WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE
trainval/KoXdjyJyxbE/50005 YOU SEE THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF US DO IN SITUATIONS LIKE THAT
trainval/KoXdjyJyxbE/50006 IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF ALL THE PLANNING AND MARKING AND EXTRA STUFF THAT WE DO
trainval/KoXdjyJyxbE/50007 IT'S A METAPHOR THAT NOT ONLY IMPLIES AVOIDING CONFRONTATION BUT IT ALSO
trainval/KoXdjyJyxbE/50008 IN MY LINE OF WORK AS HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER I HEAR VOICES JUST LIKE THAT IN THE HALLWAYS I SEE BULLYING ALL THE TIME
trainval/KoXdjyJyxbE/50009 BUT IT WASN'T A CONVERSATION THAT I EVER PLANNED TO DELIBERATELY HAVE WITH ANY OF MY CLASSES BECAUSE LET'S
trainval/KoXdjyJyxbE/50010 THE HIDDEN CURRICULUM I'M TALKING ABOUT IS A TERM THAT DESCRIBES ALL THE CONVERSATIONS
trainval/KoXdjyJyxbE/50011 SO IN THAT MOMENT WHEN I CAME OUT TO MY STUDENTS IT FELT AS IF A BOMB HAD DROPPED
trainval/KoXdjyJyxbE/50012 MY STUDENTS HAD ALL KINDS OF QUESTIONS FOR ME NOT ABOUT MY PERSONAL LIFE BUT ABOUT GAY HISTORY AND OTHER
trainval/KoXdjyJyxbE/50013 AT THE END OF THE CONVERSATION I HAD TO PICK UP MY CUP OF COFFEE THAT I ALWAYS HAVE STEP OUT INTO THE
trainval/KoXdjyJyxbE/50014 NOW I WAS THAT TEACHER WHO HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT BEING GAY WITH HIS CLASS
trainval/KoXdjyJyxbE/50015 THE WHOLE SITUATION WAS WHIPPING THROUGH MY MIND SO FAST
trainval/KoXdjyJyxbE/50016 MY ANXIETY WAS GOING UP
trainval/KoXdjyJyxbE/50017 AND WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT
trainval/KoXdjyJyxbE/50018 HERE I WAS FACE TO FACE WITH ANOTHER FOOTBALL PLAYER BUT THIS TIME INSTEAD OF KNOCKING ME
trainval/KoXdjyJyxbE/50019 THAT MOMENT MEANT MORE TO ME THAN A BUILDING FULL OF PEOPLE WEARING PINK SHIRTS AND THOSE PINK
trainval/KoXdjyJyxbE/50020 OF ALL THE ASSIGNMENTS THAT I GAVE THAT YOUNG MAN ALL THE ESSAYS HE WROTE THAT MOMENT OF
trainval/KoXdjyJyxbE/50021 KIDS LIKE NOAH WHO SAT FOR OVER AN HOUR IN A MCDONALD'S FEEDING AND TALKING TO A HOMELESS MAN
trainval/kpfsQbFV5SU/50001 FROM THE MOMENT WE'RE BORN TO THE MOMENT WE DIE EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY
trainval/kpfsQbFV5SU/50002 OUR SEXUALITY IS A FUNDAMENTAL FACET OF OUR HUMANITY
trainval/kpfsQbFV5SU/50003 OKAY HOW ABOUT THIS ONE HOW ABOUT
trainval/kpfsQbFV5SU/50004 AND THAT SEXUALITY IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF WHO WE ARE AND IT'S NORMAL AND
trainval/kpfsQbFV5SU/50005 IF YOU CAN JUST GO IN THE BACK THEY ARE ALL THERE
trainval/kpfsQbFV5SU/50006 YOU JUST PICK OUT YOURS AND YOU CAN GO HOME
trainval/kpfsQbFV5SU/50007 WE HAVE TO MAKE A WORLD WHERE WHAT'S BETWEEN OUR LEGS AND THE WAY WE USE IT IS NOT USED TO CREATE
trainval/kpfsQbFV5SU/50008 THANKS VERY MUCH
trainval/KPN8LHVeFYA/50001 AND I SAID OK
trainval/KPN8LHVeFYA/50002 I KNEW THAT WHEN I WAS DRIVING THIS CAR BACK FROM IOWA I WAS GOING TO HAVE TO PASS THROUGH THIS TOWN SO I TOOK THE
trainval/KPN8LHVeFYA/50003 AND THEN I HEAR MY NAME OVER THE INTERCOM
trainval/KPN8LHVeFYA/50004 AND THE BOOK HAS THIS PICTURE ON THE COVER
trainval/KPN8LHVeFYA/50006 THAT'S WHAT I DO
trainval/KPN8LHVeFYA/50007 MAYBE IF YOU CALL THE U
trainval/KPN8LHVeFYA/50008 THEY WANTED BLACKS TO BE TRIED BY JURIES OF THEIR PEERS BECAUSE TO THAT POINT THEY WERE BEING TRIED BY ALL WHITES
trainval/KPN8LHVeFYA/50009 THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH NOT WANTING TO BE KILLED BY THE POLICE
trainval/KPN8LHVeFYA/50010 SO WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS ORGANIZATION
trainval/KPN8LHVeFYA/50011 YOU PROBABLY SAW THIS A FEW WEEKS AGO
trainval/KPN8LHVeFYA/50012 THEY WOULD WORK WITH THESE ORGANIZATIONS AND SET UP THE SAME KINDS OF PROGRAMS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES
trainval/KPN8LHVeFYA/50014 WE HAVE TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS ORGANIZATION FOR OURSELVES AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THAT
trainval/KPN8LHVeFYA/50015 IT WOUNDED SEVERAL PEOPLE
trainval/KPPxXeoIzRY/50001 I FEEL LIKE I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SAY AND SOMETHING TO SHARE
trainval/KPPxXeoIzRY/50002 I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS GOING TO BE GOOD OR NOT
trainval/KPPxXeoIzRY/50003 AND I'M GOING TO IMAGINE THIS YOU CAN DO THIS TOO IF YOU LIKE THAT I'M GOING TO JUST TAKE THE LETTER T AND I'M GOING TO IMAGINE IT IN MIND AND
trainval/KPPxXeoIzRY/50004 AND WE'LL SEE WHAT WE COME UP WITH
trainval/KPPxXeoIzRY/50005 I'M NOT ASKING THEM TO COPY EXACTLY
trainval/KPPxXeoIzRY/50006 AND THAT WAS THE VERY FIRST TIME THAT I FOUND AN OPPORTUNITY TO FEEL THAT I WAS ABLE TO EXPRESS MY OWN VOICE AND THAT'S WHAT'S
trainval/KPPxXeoIzRY/50008 SO WHAT THEY ARE ARE JUST PURE LINES
trainval/KPPxXeoIzRY/50009 THE SECOND ONE WHICH IS USING THEM AS OBJECTS TO THINK WITH THEIR ARCHITECTURAL OBJECTS I DO A SERIES OF PROVOCATIONS I SAY IF THIS
trainval/kpyc84kamhw/50001 LET'S NOT FUNDRAISE
trainval/kpyc84kamhw/50002 WHAT THAT MEANT WAS THAT INSTEAD OF SHOWING VALUE WE WOULD JUST FOCUS ON ADDING VALUE
trainval/kpyc84kamhw/50003 HE ENDED UP WALKING 70000 KILOMETERS
trainval/kpyc84kamhw/50004 WHAT WAS THE FORCE
trainval/kpyc84kamhw/50005 AND THE MARKER OF GIFTIVISM IS THAT IS FOR THE 100
trainval/kpyc84kamhw/50006 ALL THESE PEOPLE RECOGNIZED THAT
trainval/kpyc84kamhw/50007 WHAT WOULD EMERGE IF WE TURN THIS QUESTION ON ITS HEAD
trainval/kpyc84kamhw/50008 THAT WE ARE SELFISH
trainval/kpyc84kamhw/50009 SO WE TOLD ALL OUR FRIENDS ABOUT IT
trainval/kpyc84kamhw/50010 SO THEY DECIDE TO DO AN EXPERIMENT
trainval/kpyc84kamhw/50011 HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY
trainval/kpyc84kamhw/50012 IS THIS A FUNDRAISER
trainval/kpyc84kamhw/50013 I'D LIKE TO CONTRIBUTE
trainval/kpyc84kamhw/50014 AND I THINK GANDHI TACKLES THIS SPOT ON IN ONE SENTENCE THERE IS ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE'S NEED
trainval/kpyc84kamhw/50015 AND THESE GUYS ACTUALLY DO A LOT OF AMAZING INTERESTING STUFF
trainval/kpyc84kamhw/50016 THEY START TO CONNECT THEY START TO BOND
trainval/kpyc84kamhw/50017 AND JULIO SAYS I'M ABOUT TO GO TO HAVE DINNER
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50001 THROUGH THESE EXPERIENCES I'VE COME TO RECOGNIZE THAT EACH OF US HAVE SOMETHING CALLED A RANGE OF ACCEPTABLE
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50002 BUT SOMETIMES WE'RE TOO WEAK
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50003 POWER COMES IN LOTS OF FORMS
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50004 OR SOMETIMES BEING NEW TO A COUNTRY LIKE AN IMMIGRANT OR NEW TO AN ORGANIZATION OR NEW TO AN EXPERIENCE
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50005 WE HAVE VERY LITTLE LEEWAY
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50006 THE PROBLEM IS WHEN OUR RANGE NARROWS THAT PRODUCES SOMETHING CALLED THE LOW POWER
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50007 WHEN OTHER PEOPLE SEE ME AS POWERFUL THEY GRANT ME A WIDER RANGE
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50009 ON AVERAGE WOMEN MAKE LESS AMBITIOUS OFFERS AND GETS WORSE OUTCOMES THAN
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50010 BUT HANNAH RILEY BOWLES AND EMILY AMANATULLAH HAVE DISCOVERED THERE'S ONE SITUATION WHERE WOMEN GET THE SAME
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50011 THEY BECOME MORE ASSERTIVE
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50012 HOW DO WE DO THAT
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50013 BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50014 LET'S DO A LITTLE EXPERIMENT
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50015 WHEN MY NIECE WAS FOUR SHE RESISTED GETTING DRESSED AND REJECTED EVERYTHING
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50016 WHAT IF I GAVE MY DAUGHTER A CHOICE
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50017 THIS SHIRT OR THAT SHIRT
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50018 OKAY THAT SHIRT
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50019 THIS PANT OR THAT PANT
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50020 OKAY THAT PANT
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50021 ONE OF THE WAYS IS TO BE A MAMA BEAR
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50022 THIS IS SO POWERFUL
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50023 THERE'VE BEEN MULTIPLE TIMES IN MY LIFE WHERE I HAVE BEEN FOREWARNED THAT A LOW POWER PERSON HAS BEEN
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50024 I TOOK THEIR PERSPECTIVE I BECAME MORE INVESTED IN THEIR CAUSE I BECAME MORE COMMITTED TO THEM BECAUSE
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50025 THE ANSWERS ARE ALWAYS THE SAME
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50026 THEIR EYES LIT UP AND GOT BIG
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50027 THEY SMILED A BIG BEAMING SMILE
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50028 MY EYES LIT UP
trainval/KPzccnstSXg/50030 I WANT TO END WITH A FEW WORDS FROM MY LATE FATHER THAT HE SPOKE AT MY TWIN BROTHER'S WEDDING
trainval/kQa11RMCeSI/50001 THEY'RE BASICALLY RETAINING THEIR JUVENILE CHARACTERISTICS VERY LATE IN WHAT WE CALL
trainval/kQa11RMCeSI/50002 FOURTH GRADERS LOVE THEIR DINOSAURS THEY MEMORIZE THEM
trainval/KQbTvFHymLc/50001 DRAG QUEENS ARE AMAZING ROLE MODELS FOR HOW TO CREATE CONFIDENCE
trainval/KQbTvFHymLc/50002 WOULD SHE QUIT AND JUST WALK OFF THAT DAMN STAGE
trainval/KQEWc3LVfyc/50001 BUT AS I SAID THIS HASN'T WORKED OUT VERY WELL
trainval/KQEWc3LVfyc/50002 THAT'S BECAUSE WE DO WANT A PEACEFUL COMFORTABLE AND DIGNIFIED DEATH BUT
trainval/KQEWc3LVfyc/50003 LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
trainval/KQEWc3LVfyc/50004 LET'S TALK ABOUT A PATIENT NAMED LISA
trainval/KQEWc3LVfyc/50005 WHY IS THAT
trainval/KQEWc3LVfyc/50006 WE'VE SPENT THE LAST 40 YEARS TRYING TO IMPROVE CARE AT THE END OF LIFE AND BY SOME MEASURES
trainval/KQEWc3LVfyc/50007 DON'T TAKE MY HOPE AWAY IS WHAT THEY BEG OF US NEAR THE END
trainval/KQEWc3LVfyc/50008 THE CLOSER WE GET THE END OF OUR LIVES THE MORE FEARFUL WE BECOME THE MORE
trainval/KQEWc3LVfyc/50009 HE COULD NEVER ACCEPT THAT
trainval/KQEWc3LVfyc/50010 DEATH IS NOT A BATTLE WE HAVE LOST
trainval/KQEWc3LVfyc/50011 DEATH IS NOT A FAILURE OF WILL
trainval/KQEWc3LVfyc/50012 ONE OF MY PATIENTS WAS TELLING ME HOW UPSET SHE WAS WITH HER ONCOLOGIST
trainval/KQEWc3LVfyc/50013 HOPE IS VITAL
trainval/Kqm9AEvJgxU/50001 IT DOES MAKE SENSE THIS IS A LOGICAL SNACK
trainval/KRrNST9OAcA/50001 THESE KINDS OF LOSSES ARE OUT OF OUR CONTROL
trainval/kSGFq12w5WU/50001 IT WAS SO ARCHITECTURAL
trainval/kSGFq12w5WU/50002 IT'S KIND OF A FORWARD OSMOSIS
trainval/kSGFq12w5WU/50003 NATURE HAS BEEN DOING THAT FOR A LONG TIME
trainval/kSGFq12w5WU/50004 AND THEY'RE HAVING APPLIANCES IN YOUR HOME TALK TO ONE ANOTHER THROUGH THAT ALGORITHM AND
trainval/kSGFq12w5WU/50005 NONE OF THESE ARE USING THE ORGANISMS
trainval/kSGFq12w5WU/50006 AND THAT INFORMATION WILL GO INTO ASKNATURE
trainval/KshwSURVhZA/50001 FROM ROCK DRAWINGS IN CAVES DATING BACK THOUSANDS OF YEARS TO THE LATEST IPHONE
trainval/KshwSURVhZA/50002 SHORTOLOGY BECAME A PROJECT OF 13 BOOKS HUNDREDS OF STORIES CHARACTERS
trainval/KshwSURVhZA/50003 WE WANTED TO CREATE SOMETHING WHICH COULD HELP ANYONE TO EXPRESS IDEAS
trainval/KsqZqa9zYXA/50001 ALL I COULD DO WAS WISH SOMEONE APPROPRIATE WOULD APPEAR AND SOLVE
trainval/KsqZqa9zYXA/50002 THE NEWS WERE SO SUDDEN FOR ME
trainval/kSR8G8mfp84/50001 IF JENIPHER WANTS CREDIT HER OPTIONS ARE LIMITED
trainval/KsSSMh1QhMc/50001 EVEN THE BBC AND THE NEW YORK TIMES
trainval/KsSSMh1QhMc/50002 SO HOW MANY OF YOU ARE SORT OF MAKING YOURSELVES SMALLER
trainval/KsSSMh1QhMc/50003 WE MAKE OURSELVES SMALL
trainval/KsSSMh1QhMc/50004 THEY TAKE MORE RISKS
trainval/KsSSMh1QhMc/50005 BUT REALLY POWER IS ALSO ABOUT HOW YOU REACT TO STRESS
trainval/KsSSMh1QhMc/50006 PROBABLY NOT RIGHT
trainval/KsSSMh1QhMc/50007 WHERE ARE YOU BEING EVALUATED EITHER BY YOUR FRIENDS
trainval/KsSSMh1QhMc/50008 FOR TEENAGERS IT'S AT THE LUNCHROOM TABLE
trainval/KsSSMh1QhMc/50009 IT'S YOU TALKING TO YOURSELF
trainval/KsSSMh1QhMc/50010 SO THIS REALLY SPIKES YOUR CORTISOL
trainval/KsSSMh1QhMc/50011 WE ALSO EVALUATE THESE PEOPLE MUCH MORE POSITIVELY OVERALL
trainval/KsSSMh1QhMc/50012 THEY SAY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FINISH COLLEGE
trainval/KsSSMh1QhMc/50013 EVENTUALLY I GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE
trainval/KsSSMh1QhMc/50014 YOU'RE JUST GOING TO DO IT AND DO IT AND DO IT EVEN IF YOU'RE TERRIFIED AND JUST PARALYZED AND HAVING AN OUT OF
trainval/KsSSMh1QhMc/50015 LIKE I HAVE BECOME THIS
trainval/KsSSMh1QhMc/50016 I AM ACTUALLY DOING THIS
trainval/KsSSMh1QhMc/50017 THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
trainval/KsSSMh1QhMc/50018 CONFIGURE YOUR BRAIN TO COPE THE BEST IN THAT SITUATION
trainval/KsSSMh1QhMc/50019 GET YOUR TESTOSTERONE UP
trainval/KsSSMh1QhMc/50020 GET YOUR CORTISOL DOWN
trainval/KsSSMh1QhMc/50021 I WAS THROWN FROM THE CAR
trainval/kSva30kSgHM/50001 IT HAS FUSION OF VERTEBRAE IN THAT TAIL
trainval/kSva30kSgHM/50002 IT'S A RATHER HORRIBLE DEBILITATING DISEASE AND IT LOOKS A LOT LIKE THE FUSION OF BONES AT THE END OF THE
trainval/KSWL5iqvPlY/50001 I RESENTED THE PART OF ME THAT WAS IN PAIN
trainval/KSWL5iqvPlY/50002 HOLDING FOUR YEAR OLD SASHA'S HAND FELT SO GOOD I'VE DECIDED TO DIRECT A FEATURE LENGTH
trainval/KSWL5iqvPlY/50003 I WANTED TO SHARE MY STORY WITH THE WORLD AND PUSH FOR A CONVERSATION THAT I FELT OUR SOCIETY WAS STRUGGLING TO
trainval/KSWL5iqvPlY/50004 I CAN'T CHANGE THE PAST I CAN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT I WAS SEXUALLY ABUSED AS A CHILD
trainval/kSxhDZaLyVQ/50001 BECAUSE ALL I KNEW GROWING UP WAS THAT MY DAD LOVED MY GRANDPA AND GRANDPA LOVED
trainval/kSxhDZaLyVQ/50002 WHEN I WOULD HEAR OTHER PEOPLE SAY
trainval/kSxhDZaLyVQ/50003 AND WHEN I LOOKED AROUND I BEGAN TO SEE WHAT MY TRUTH REALLY WAS
trainval/kSZEsPnhIXg/50001 BUT NOT JUST EVERYDAY
trainval/kSZEsPnhIXg/50002 CAN WE DO THIS MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY
trainval/kSZEsPnhIXg/50003 CAN WE WAKE UP
trainval/kSZEsPnhIXg/50004 BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ARE AFRAID RIGHT
trainval/kSZEsPnhIXg/50005 WE DO STUPID THINGS
trainval/ktOeFgmdIAo/50001 NOW LET'S IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT THAT I WAS PREGNANT
trainval/ktOeFgmdIAo/50002 THERE'S ALSO A GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH SHOWING THAT PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE MORE DISCRIMINATION
trainval/ktOeFgmdIAo/50003 EVEN THE THREAT OF DISCRIMINATION LIKE WORRYING YOU MIGHT BE STOPPED BY POLICE WHILE DRIVING YOUR CAR
trainval/ktOeFgmdIAo/50004 I BECAME A DOULA A LAY PERSON TRAINED TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO PEOPLE DURING PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
trainval/ktOeFgmdIAo/50005 AND BECAUSE I'M LATINA AND A SPANISH SPEAKER IN MY FIRST VOLUNTEER DOULA GIG AT A PUBLIC HOSPITAL IN NORTH
trainval/ktOeFgmdIAo/50006 BUT WHEN I TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THESE APPALLING STATISTICS I'M USUALLY MET WITH AN ASSUMPTION THAT IT'S ABOUT EITHER
trainval/ktOeFgmdIAo/50007 IT'S WHAT RESEARCHERS CALL THE IMMIGRANT PARADOX AND IT FURTHER ILLUSTRATES THAT THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE US ENVIRONMENT THAT IS MAKING
trainval/ktOeFgmdIAo/50008 THE SOLUTION IS CALLED THE JJ WAY
trainval/ktOeFgmdIAo/50009 BUT BY PROVIDING ACCESSIBLE AND RESPECTFUL PRENATAL CARE JENNIE HAS ACHIEVED SOMETHING REMARKABLE
trainval/ktOeFgmdIAo/50010 NO ONE IS TURNED AWAY DUE TO LACK OF FUNDS
trainval/ktOeFgmdIAo/50011 NO ONE IS CHASTISED FOR SHOWING UP LATE TO THEIR APPOINTMENTS
trainval/ktOeFgmdIAo/50012 WE CAN'T HAVE YOU NOT EATING
trainval/ktOeFgmdIAo/50013 THAT WE IS ACTUALLY A REALLY CRUCIAL ASPECT OF JENNIE'S MODEL
trainval/ktOeFgmdIAo/50014 SHE SEES HER STAFF AS PART OF A TEAM THAT ALONGSIDE THE WOMAN AND HER FAMILY HAS ONE GOAL
trainval/ktOeFgmdIAo/50015 REMEMBER THOSE STATISTICS I TOLD YOU THAT BLACK WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO GIVE BIRTH TOO EARLY TO GIVE BIRTH TO LOW BIRTH WEIGHT
trainval/ktOeFgmdIAo/50016 WELL YOU'D BE WRONG
trainval/ktOeFgmdIAo/50017 THEY INVOLVE ELABORATE PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS MEANT TO PROTECT US THAT WHEN OVERSTIMULATED ACTUALLY MAKE US SICK
trainval/ktOeFgmdIAo/50018 THEIR APPROACH IS CASUAL AND FRIENDLY
trainval/ktOeFgmdIAo/50019 AS TRINA DEFLATED THE BLOOD PRESSURE CUFF SHE SAID WE'LL SEE ABOUT CHANGING YOUR PRESCRIPTION OK
trainval/kTqgiF4HmgQ/50001 THEY'RE JUST BEING REINVENTED IN WAYS THAT ARE RELEVANT FOR THE FACEBOOK AGE
trainval/kTqgiF4HmgQ/50002 HOW DO WE MIMIC THE WAY TRUST IS BUILT FACE TO FACE ONLINE
trainval/kTqgiF4HmgQ/50003 JUST BECAUSE SEBASTIAN IS A WONDERFUL HOST DOES NOT MEAN THAT HE CAN ASSEMBLE IKEA FURNITURE
trainval/kTqgiF4HmgQ/50004 I THINK TASKRABBIT AND OTHER EXAMPLES OF COLLABORATIVE CONSUMPTION ARE LIKE LEMONADE STANDS ON STEROIDS
trainval/kTqgiF4HmgQ/50005 THEY'RE JUST BRILLIANT
trainval/kTqgiF4HmgQ/50006 BUT THE BIGGER PRINCIPLE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING BEHIND STACK OVERFLOW I THINK IS INCREDIBLY EXCITING
trainval/kTqgiF4HmgQ/50007 PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO REALIZE THAT THE REPUTATION THEY GENERATE IN ONE PLACE HAS
trainval/kTsqFn33RiQ/50001 A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THIS IS HOUSING
trainval/kTsqFn33RiQ/50002 I KNOW THIS IN PART BECAUSE THIS IS MY STORY
trainval/kTsqFn33RiQ/50003 AND YOU MIGHT THINK I'M TALKING ABOUT TORONTO
trainval/kTsqFn33RiQ/50004 YOU'RE ENTITLED TO THAT TOO
trainval/KTTtn0iSZyA/50001 THIS WASN'T WORKING
trainval/KTTtn0iSZyA/50002 AND SHE WAS AFRAID
trainval/KTTtn0iSZyA/50003 SHE WAS NOT BEING STUBBORN WHEN SHE REARED SHE WAS FEARING FOR HER LIFE
trainval/KTTtn0iSZyA/50004 BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT NOW SAL SEES ME AS A SOURCE OF SUPPORT AND
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50001 I DON'T SEE THESE AS WOMEN'S ISSUES THAT SOME GOOD MEN HELP OUT WITH
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50002 IN FACT I'M GOING TO ARGUE THAT THESE ARE MEN'S ISSUES FIRST AND FOREMOST
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50003 IT'S ALMOST LIKE A CHIP IN OUR BRAIN IS ACTIVATED AND THE NEURAL PATHWAYS TAKE OUR ATTENTION IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION WHEN WE HEAR THE
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50004 THERE'S SOME CONFUSION ABOUT THE TERM GENDER
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50005 AND LET ME ILLUSTRATE THAT CONFUSION BY WAY OF ANALOGY
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50006 AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN THEY HEAR THE WORD GENDER THINK IT MEANS WOMEN
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50007 THAT'S A GOOD ENGLISH SENTENCE
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50008 NOT JUST WOMEN AND GIRLS BUT ALSO MEN AND BOYS
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50009 WE'VE GONE FROM JOHN BEAT MARY TO MARY WAS BEATEN BY JOHN
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50010 WE'RE NOT EVEN THINKING ABOUT JOHN IT'S TOTALLY FOCUSED ON MARY
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50011 AND OFTEN TIMES MEN LIKE MYSELF GET A LOT OF CREDIT AND PUBLIC ACCLAIM FOR DOING THE WORK THAT WOMEN
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50012 WHY DO THEY KEEP GOING BACK
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50013 WHY WAS SHE DRINKING WITH THOSE GUYS IN THAT HOTEL ROOM
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50014 SO ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE CAN USE THE SPOTLIGHT IS TO THANK WOMEN AND HONOR WOMEN'S LEADERSHIP GOING FORWARD
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50015 THIS IS ALL UNCONSCIOUS
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50016 IT'S A LEGITIMATE THING TO ASK
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50017 ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT MARY IS NOT GOING TO GET US ANYWHERE IN TERMS OF PREVENTING VIOLENCE
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50018 THE QUESTIONS ARE NOT ABOUT MARY THEY'RE ABOUT JOHN
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50019 WHY IS THAT A COMMON PROBLEM IN OUR SOCIETY AND ALL OVER THE WORLD TODAY
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50020 WE HEAR ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50021 THAT'S A VERY NAIVE NOTION RIGHT
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50022 SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE IN OUR SOCIETY AND IN THE WORLD
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50023 WE DON'T LIKE IT WHEN PEOPLE CHALLENGE OUR POWER
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50024 WHAT ARE THE ROLES OF VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS IN HELPING TO PRODUCE ABUSIVE MEN
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50025 WHAT ABOUT ALL THOSE BOYS
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50026 WHAT ABOUT ALL THE YOUNG MEN AND BOYS WHO HAVE BEEN TRAUMATIZED BY ADULT MEN'S VIOLENCE
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50027 YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50028 AND IF WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT MALE VICTIMS LET'S TALK ABOUT MALE VICTIMS
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50029 MOST MALE VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE ARE THE VICTIMS OF OTHER MEN'S VIOLENCE
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50030 SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT BOTH WOMEN AND MEN HAVE IN COMMON
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50031 WE ARE BOTH VICTIMS OF MEN'S VIOLENCE
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50032 I'M USING THE GENDER BINARY
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50033 I KNOW THERE'S MORE THAN MEN AND WOMEN THERE'S MORE THAN MALE AND FEMALE
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50034 HOW DOES ALL THIS WORK
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50035 THERE'S A WHOLE SPECTRUM
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50036 WHAT DO WE DO
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50037 HOW DO WE SPEAK UP
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50038 HOW DO WE CHALLENGE OUR FRIENDS
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50039 HOW DO WE SUPPORT OUR FRIENDS
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50040 BUT HOW DO WE NOT REMAIN SILENT IN THE FACE OF ABUSE
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50041 NOW WHEN IT COMES TO MEN AND MALE CULTURE THE GOAL IS TO GET MEN WHO ARE NOT ABUSIVE TO CHALLENGE MEN WHO ARE
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50042 JUST LIKE WITH HETEROSEXISM IF YOU'RE A HETEROSEXUAL PERSON AND YOU YOURSELF DON'T ENACT HARASSING OR ABUSIVE BEHAVIORS TOWARDS
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50043 WE'LL SEE A RADICAL DIMINUTION OF THE ABUSE
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50044 BECAUSE THE TYPICAL PERPETRATOR IS NOT SICK AND TWISTED
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50045 THERE'S BEEN AN AWFUL LOT OF SILENCE IN MALE CULTURE ABOUT THIS ONGOING TRAGEDY OF MEN'S VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND CHILDREN
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50046 THERE'S BEEN AN AWFUL LOT OF SILENCE
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50047 BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR TAKING A STAND ON THESE ISSUES SHOULD NOT FALL ON THE SHOULDERS OF LITTLE BOYS OR
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50048 HOW CAN WE CHANGE THE SOCIALIZATION OF BOYS AND THE DEFINITIONS OF MANHOOD THAT LEAD TO THESE CURRENT OUTCOMES
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50049 ADULT MEN WITH POWER ARE THE ONES WE NEED TO BE HOLDING ACCOUNTABLE FOR BEING LEADERS ON THESE ISSUES BECAUSE WHEN SOMEBODY SPEAKS UP IN A
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50050 BUT ON A BIG SCALE WE NEED MORE ADULT MEN WITH POWER TO START PRIORITIZING THESE ISSUES
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50051 WE KNOW ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WE CAN EASILY DO THAT
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50052 IT'S UNBELIEVABLE REALLY
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50053 BUT WHEN YOU GET INTO IT YOU REALIZE THERE ARE PRESSURES ON MEN
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50054 BY THE WAY WE OWE IT TO WOMEN
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50055 OTHER PEOPLE WILL SAY WELL GET OFF IT
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50056 THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50057 BUT WE ALSO OWE IT TO OUR SONS
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50058 WE ALSO OWE IT TO YOUNG MEN WHO ARE GROWING UP ALL OVER THE WORLD IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY DIDN'T MAKE THE CHOICE TO BE A
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50059 THEY DIDN'T MAKE THE CHOICE
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50060 I KNOW WE CAN DO IT WE CAN DO BETTER
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50061 MY ARGUMENT IS HE DOESN'T NEED SENSITIVITY TRAINING
trainval/KTvSfeCRxe8/50062 HE NEEDS LEADERSHIP TRAINING BECAUSE HE'S BEING A BAD LEADER BECAUSE IN A SOCIETY WITH GENDER DIVERSITY AND
trainval/kTz52RWSbD0/50001 SHOULDN'T WE GO AHEAD WITH OUR ENLIGHTENED PROGRESSIVE SELVES AND RELEGATE USELESS CONCEPTS LIKE RACE TO THE DUSTBINS OF
trainval/kTz52RWSbD0/50002 BUT NOW IN THE NAME OF URBAN RENEWAL AND PROGRESS THESE COMMUNITIES ARE PUSHED OUT IN SERVICE OF
trainval/kTz52RWSbD0/50003 SO WE TYPICALLY ARRIVE TO EVENTS 30 MINUTES EARLY
trainval/kTz52RWSbD0/50004 THESE TIME SPACE CLASHES BETWEEN PROTESTERS AND POLICE BETWEEN GENTRIFIERS AND
trainval/kTz52RWSbD0/50005 OUR LIVES ARE LIVES OF PERPETUAL URGENCY
trainval/kTz52RWSbD0/50006 SO TODAY WHITE PEOPLE CONTINUE TO CONTROL THE FLOW AND THRUST OF HISTORY WHILE TOO OFTEN TREATING BLACK
trainval/KU0zEEDRKXo/50001 AND WHERE DID THE MONEY COME FROM USUALLY
trainval/kU7veyGGps4/50001 SO WE'RE GOING TO PLAY A LITTLE GAME I LIKE TO CALL WHICH IS WHICH
trainval/kU7veyGGps4/50002 I PLAY THIS WITH NEW DOCTORS AND ASTRONOMERS I WORK WITH
trainval/kU7veyGGps4/50003 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU TWO IMAGES ON THE SCREEN
trainval/kU7veyGGps4/50004 ONE OF THEM IS BIOMEDICAL AND ONE OF THEM IS ASTRONOMICAL AND YOU HAVE TO PICK THEM CORRECTLY IN
trainval/kU7veyGGps4/50005 SO HERE IS THE FIRST SET
trainval/kU7veyGGps4/50006 IF WE WERE TO LOOK AT THE RAW DATA FROM THESE TELESCOPES
trainval/kU7veyGGps4/50008 ALL I CAN SAY IS IT HAS JUST BEEN WONDERFUL
trainval/kU7veyGGps4/50009 NOT REALLY GOOD AT THAT WHOLE GREEN YELLOW BLUE THING
trainval/KVhWqwnZ1eM/50001 BECAUSE AFTER ALL TALKING ABOUT THE DEVELOPING WORLD IS LIKE HAVING TWO CHAPTERS IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES
trainval/KVhWqwnZ1eM/50002 THE LAST CHAPTER IS ABOUT PRESENT AND PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THE OTHER IS ABOUT THE PAST WHERE YOU
trainval/KVhWqwnZ1eM/50003 DOES YOUR MINDSET CORRESPOND TO MY DATASET
trainval/KVhWqwnZ1eM/50004 YOU CAN WATCH ME FOR ONE MINUTE NOW AND YOU'LL SEE THE WHOLE THING
trainval/KVhWqwnZ1eM/50005 BECAUSE IN FACT THIS IS CHILD LABOR
trainval/KVhWqwnZ1eM/50007 AND ASIA COULD HAVE SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT BEFORE THEY GOT THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
trainval/KVhWqwnZ1eM/50008 WE HAVE ALL THIS AT THE SAME TIME
trainval/KVhWqwnZ1eM/50009 THAT'S WHY IT'S SO PROBLEMATIC TO DESCRIBE WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD
trainval/KVhWqwnZ1eM/50010 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/KVhWqwnZ1eM/50011 QUITE THE OPPOSITE OF THE WORLD BANK WHO COMPILED DATA WITH GOVERNMENT MONEY TAX MONEY AND THEN
trainval/KVhWqwnZ1eM/50012 AND WHEN IT COMES TO FREE DATA AND TRANSPARENCY UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS ONE OF THE BEST
trainval/KVhWqwnZ1eM/50013 AND HOW FAST HAS THIS HAPPENED
trainval/KVhWqwnZ1eM/50014 DON'T MAKE IT AFRICA
trainval/KVhWqwnZ1eM/50015 DON'T MAKE IT A RACE ISSUE
trainval/KVhWqwnZ1eM/50016 MAKE IT A LOCAL ISSUE
trainval/KVhWqwnZ1eM/50017 IT WILL NEVER AFFECT A RICH PERSON
trainval/KVhWqwnZ1eM/50018 THAT HAS NOW DISAPPEARED AND THEY ARE NOW IN GREAT ECONOMIC PROBLEM
trainval/KVhWqwnZ1eM/50019 AND ONE WEEK AGO FOR THE FIRST TIME THERE WERE FOUR LINES ON THE INTERNET
trainval/KVhWqwnZ1eM/50020 THIS IS NOT THE STATE DEPARTMENT
trainval/KVhWqwnZ1eM/50021 AND WE HAVE A HIGH HOPE IN YOU
trainval/KVjkFqS7Y6A/50001 IT'S ESSENTIALLY THIS VIRTUAL MAP THAT ONLY EXISTS IN YOUR BRAIN
trainval/KVjkFqS7Y6A/50002 MAYBE YOU'VE HAD THAT EXPERIENCE AS WELL
trainval/KVjkFqS7Y6A/50003 SO THAT'S WHAT I DID
trainval/kvpUiBqHoVM/50001 BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM
trainval/kvpUiBqHoVM/50002 THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE DON'T REALLY LIKE THE UNIVERSE THAT WE'VE ENDED UP WITH
trainval/kvpUiBqHoVM/50003 WE'VE GOT THIS 96 OF THE UNIVERSE IN A FORM THAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND
trainval/kvpUiBqHoVM/50004 AND SO WE NEEDED A NEW SOLUTION
trainval/kvpUiBqHoVM/50005 WE DECIDED TO CALL FOR HELP
trainval/kvpUiBqHoVM/50006 WE SET UP A WEB SITE CALLED GALAXY ZOO
trainval/kvpUiBqHoVM/50007 THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TODAY
trainval/kvpUiBqHoVM/50008 SOMETHING ELSE VERY INTERESTING HAPPENS WHEN YOU INVITE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO TAKE PART IN YOUR RESEARCH
trainval/kvpUiBqHoVM/50009 HE INSPIRED MANY OTHER PEOPLE TO COME TO GALAXY ZOO AND JOIN IN
trainval/kvpUiBqHoVM/50010 WE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS THERE
trainval/kvpUiBqHoVM/50011 BUT BECAUSE WE HAD SO MANY EYES AND WE COULD PAY INDIVIDUAL ATTENTION TO EACH IMAGE WE WERE ABLE TO
trainval/kvpUiBqHoVM/50012 THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT CONFRONTS SCIENTISTS IN FIELD AFTER FIELD AFTER FIELD
trainval/kvpUiBqHoVM/50013 WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO INSTEAD IS LOOK FOR THE INDIRECT SIGNS THAT THEY'RE THERE
trainval/kvpUiBqHoVM/50014 AND THEN WE MADE THE NICE IMAGE SO THAT THEY COULD TRY AND IMAGE WHAT THAT PLANET WAS LIKE
trainval/kvpUiBqHoVM/50015 IT'S GOING TO SCAN THE WHOLE SKY ONCE EVERY 3 NIGHTS
trainval/kvpUiBqHoVM/50016 AND IT'S NO EXAGGERATION TO SAY IT'S GOING PROVIDE A MOVIE OF THE UNIVERSE
trainval/kvpUiBqHoVM/50017 WE'RE GOING TO SEE ALL THE ASTEROIDS WHIZZING AROUND THE SOLAR SYSTEM
trainval/kvpUiBqHoVM/50018 WE COULD PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT IT IS THAT MACHINES CAN DO
trainval/kvpUiBqHoVM/50019 MAYBE THEY CAN CLASSIFY THE ROUTINE EVENTS
trainval/kvpUiBqHoVM/50020 AND PLANET HUNTERS 1B IS CURRENTLY A UNIQUE WORLD
trainval/KvQRF6PKojA/50001 AND I THINK THIS IS BECAUSE THERE IS LESS ROOM LEFT FOR THEIR ENGAGEMENT
trainval/Kw5vyJ30djM/50001 TO BE MY AUTHENTIC SELF AND TO JUST HAVE MY FAMILY BE PROUD OF ME
trainval/Kw5vyJ30djM/50002 AND IT BECAME CLEAR VERY QUICKLY THAT THE SAME FORCES THE SAME FORCES THAT SAID TO ME
trainval/Kw5vyJ30djM/50003 NO YOU'RE NOT A WOMAN THOSE ARE THE SAME FORCES THAT SAY THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO LOVE ONLY ONE WAY TO LIVE
trainval/KxDwieKpawg/50002 AND HE ORDERS A PINT AND THEY SIT IN SILENCE FOR A WHILE
trainval/KxDwieKpawg/50003 YOU'VE GONE THROUGH HUNDREDS OF TV CHANNELS JUST SWITCHING CHANNEL AFTER CHANNEL AND THEN SUDDENLY YOU ACTUALLY
trainval/KxDwieKpawg/50004 SOMETIMES IT'S AS SIMPLE AS ONCE UPON A TIME
trainval/KxDwieKpawg/50005 GAVE IT MORE LOVE AND CARE THAN MY OWN CHILD
trainval/KxDwieKpawg/50006 AND IT'S LIKE A MAGNET
trainval/KxDwieKpawg/50008 AND WOODY'S WAS TO DO WHAT WAS BEST FOR HIS CHILD
trainval/KxDwieKpawg/50009 SO I WANTED TO BECOME MUCH BETTER AT IT AND LEARN ANYTHING I COULD
trainval/KxDwieKpawg/50010 SO I RESEARCHED EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY COULD
trainval/KxDwieKpawg/50011 IN THE SHORT TERM HAVE YOU MADE ME WANT TO KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT
trainval/KxDwieKpawg/50012 BUT UNDER THAT WAS THIS GLOBAL TENSION OF WILL WE EVER FIND NEMO IN THIS HUGE VAST OCEAN
trainval/KxDwieKpawg/50013 AND WE GOT A HOLD OF THAT FAX
trainval/KxDwieKpawg/50014 SHE GAVE A WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF MICHAEL CORLEONE AL PACINO'S CHARACTER IN THE GODFATHER AND THAT PROBABLY HIS
trainval/KxDwieKpawg/50015 AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT ALWAYS DROVE ALL HIS CHOICES
trainval/KxDwieKpawg/50016 YET THERE WAS SOMETHING MORE BEING SAID
trainval/KxDwieKpawg/50017 WHAT EXACTLY WAS IT
trainval/KxDwieKpawg/50018 AND IT WASN'T UNTIL ON ONE OF MY LATER VIEWINGS THAT THE VEIL WAS LIFTED AND IT WAS IN A SCENE WHERE HE'S WALKED ACROSS THE
trainval/KxDwieKpawg/50019 EVERYTHING LAWRENCE DID IN THAT MOVIE WAS AN ATTEMPT FOR HIM TO FIGURE OUT WHERE HIS PLACE WAS IN THE WORLD
trainval/KxDwieKpawg/50020 AND WHEN AN ARTIST DOES THAT TO ANOTHER ARTIST IT'S LIKE YOU'RE COMPELLED TO PASS IT ON
trainval/KxDwieKpawg/50021 USE WHAT YOU KNOW
trainval/KxDwieKpawg/50022 DRAW FROM IT
trainval/KxDwieKpawg/50023 IT DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN PLOT OR FACT
trainval/Kxg0SEpOcWs/50001 AND SOME OF THE IMPLICATIONS ARE QUITE AMAZING
trainval/kyaiTGmwxnU/50001 I'M THE FIRST WOMAN IN BOTH SIDES OF MY FAMILY TO EVER WORK OUTSIDE THE HOME AND EVER
trainval/kyaiTGmwxnU/50002 WHEN I HEAR THESE ARGUMENTS I STILL CONTINUE TO BRISTLE BECAUSE I HAVE FAMILY AND FRIENDS
trainval/kyaiTGmwxnU/50003 AND TO MY PARENTS ME DOING SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS HAVING A SLEEVELESS TOP RIGHT NOW SHOWING MY SHOULDERS
trainval/kyaiTGmwxnU/50004 WOMEN ARE NOW ALLOWED TO PRAY IN OUR CHURCH WIDE MEETINGS AND THEY NEVER WERE BEFORE IN THE GENERAL CONFERENCES
trainval/kyaiTGmwxnU/50005 WE'RE ALL JUST PART OF RELIGIONS
trainval/KyamsZXXF2w/50001 AND SO THESE COMBINE TO FORM A VERY INTENSE EMOTIONAL ENGAGEMENT
trainval/KyamsZXXF2w/50002 THAT WOULD BE VERY BORING
trainval/KyamsZXXF2w/50003 WE ALSO SAY THERE'S GOING TO BE LOADS OF OTHER ITEMS OF VARYING QUALITIES AND LEVELS OF EXCITEMENT
trainval/KyamsZXXF2w/50005 NO WE WANT ONE OR TWO MONSTERS ON THE SCREEN AT ANY ONE TIME
trainval/KyamsZXXF2w/50007 I'M GOING TO GIVE UP
trainval/KyamsZXXF2w/50008 THIS LIGHTS THE BRAIN UP
trainval/KyamsZXXF2w/50009 THERE ARE REAL CONCERNS THERE
trainval/KyamsZXXF2w/50010 WE CAN USE CALCULATED RANDOMNESS
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50001 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50002 AND I WANT TO KNOW THAT CAUSE I WANT TO EMPATHIZE WITH THAT CAUSE
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50003 WHEN I AM TRAVELING I FIND THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT SLICES OF CULTURE THAT I NEVER REALIZED PEOPLE COULD BE
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50004 WHY ARE YOU GOING TO IRAN
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50005 SMELL THIS CHEESE
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50006 IT SMELLS LIKE THE FEET OF ANGELS
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50007 AND IF I AM MAKING A TOUR OR A GUIDEBOOK OR A TV SHOW AND I AM NOT CONNECTING PEOPLE WITH PEOPLE I AM KIND OF NERVOUS BECAUSE
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50008 THAT'S THE MARK OF A GOOD TRIP
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50009 AND I'D LIKE TO TAKE JUST A FEW MINUTES TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50010 WHY DO AMERICANS HAVE SUCH SOFT BREAD
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50011 NORWEGIANS HAVE THE NORWEGIAN DREAM
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50012 BULGARIANS HAVE THE BULGARIAN DREAM
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50013 YOU ALREADY HAVE
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50014 CUT GLASS PEAKS AGAINST THAT BLUE SKY
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50015 WELL IN THE ADULTHOOD YOU REALIZE
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50016 AND AHEAD OF ME I HEAR THE LONG LEGATO TONES OF AN ALPHORN ANNOUNCING THAT THE HELICOPTER STOCKED MOUNTAIN HUT IS OPEN
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50017 IT DOESN'T DIMINISH OURS BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO REMEMBER IN OUR TRAVELS THAT THERE ARE OTHER HEROES
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50018 ONE GREAT WAY TO MAKE YOUR TRAVELS MORE MEANINGFUL IS TO RELATE TO TO EMBRACE A
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50019 AN EASY ONE IS
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50021 A PRESENT DAY NATHAN HALE
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50022 A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS DUE FOR A VACATION
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50023 I WAS HEADING FOR MAZATL N AND I WAS JUST NEEDY FOR A NICE STRETCH OF PRISTINE BEACH SWEPT FREE OF
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50025 YOU'RE IN IRAN ANYTIME SOMETHING'S FRUSTRATING TO US AND OUT OF OUR CONTROL WE SAY DEATH TO THAT
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50026 I THOUGHT WELL HAVE I EVER SAID DAMN SOMETHING
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50027 IRAN HAS GOT BAGGAGE AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH THEM SMARTLY
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50028 IT'S A THRIVING COUNTRY OF 70 MILLION PEOPLE
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50029 I SAID YEAH
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50030 SHE DID ONE OF THOSE LITTLE POINT ON MY CHEST THINGS SHE SAID
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50031 I WANT TO KNOW WHAT MAKES THEM TICK
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50032 WELL YOU KNOW THEY GREW UP WITH THE SHAH ON THE THRONE
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50033 YOU NEED TO GO THERE AND MEET THESE PEOPLE
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50034 A GREAT SORT OF LEARNING AREA WADING POOL FOR WORLD EXPLORATION TO ME IS EUROPE
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50035 IN EUROPE THEY'VE GOT THE SAME VICTIMLESS CRIME ISSUES AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO THEM
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50036 MY FRIENDS IN EUROPE ALWAYS REMIND ME
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50037 A SOCIETY HAS TO MAKE A CHOICE TOLERATE ALTERNATIVE LIFE STYLES OR BUILD MORE PRISONS
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50038 I THINK IT'S INTERESTING WHEN YOU GO TO SCANDINAVIA HOW MANY DRUNK TEENAGERS YOU FIND ON DECORATED TRUCKS
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50039 JUST SAY NO
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50040 I'VE GOT A GOOD FRIEND IN SWITZERLAND WHO'S A SCHOOL TEACHER IN A LITTLE TRADITIONAL VILLAGE WHERE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME LAST
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50041 AND FOR 30 YEARS I'VE HAD THE POOR REACHING IN MY WINDOW
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50042 AND I'LL TELL YOU
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50043 I JUST LOVE TURKEY AND AS A TOUR GUIDE I HAD THE CHANCE TO TAKE A GROUP TO GET TO KNOW A WHIRLING DERVISH
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50044 I KNEW THIS DERVISH AND I ASKED HIM
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50045 I'M A DERVISH THAT'S LIKE A MONK THAT FOLLOWS MEVLANA THAT'S SORT OF A TEACHER IN ISLAM
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50047 AND I WHIRL AND I WHIRL AND I LOSE MYSELF IN THAT TRANSE THINKING OF THE TEACHINGS OF MEVLANA
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50048 TO BE THERE AS TOUR GUIDE WITH MY GROUP WATCHING HIM HIS HEAD TILTED OVER HIS ROBE THEN GOES OUT AND HE LOSES
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50049 NOW APPRECIATING THE VALUE OF TRAVEL IS NOTHING NEW
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50050 1400 YEARS AGO MOHAMMED SAID
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50051 IN OTHER WORDS IT'S HELPED ME TO BECOME A BETTER CITIZEN OF THIS PLANET
trainval/kYXiegTXsEs/50052 WELL IT'S BEEN 25 YEARS SINCE THEY ARRESTED A POT SMOKER IN THE NETHERLANDS AND WHAT THEY FOUND AFTER 25 YEARS IS
trainval/kyznWXHEX1o/50001 BUT EVEN HIGH SCHOOL
trainval/kyznWXHEX1o/50002 I SAID I'M DOING GREAT
trainval/kyznWXHEX1o/50003 HE SAID WONDERFUL
trainval/kYZqyjzuaOw/50001 OR PRE SYMBOLIC PLAY
trainval/kYZqyjzuaOw/50002 WHAT IS HAPPENING IN FIRST PLAY
trainval/kYZqyjzuaOw/50003 THERE IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF POSITIVE SENSORY INPUT
trainval/kYZqyjzuaOw/50004 I WAS FORTUNATE TO TRAIN WITH DR
trainval/kYZqyjzuaOw/50005 LET'S SAY I'M MEETING A FIVE YEAR OLD FOR THE FIRST TIME
trainval/kYZqyjzuaOw/50006 OR THAT CLAPPING GAME HOW ABOUT THAT ONE
trainval/KzeQSZ3bQ2g/50001 GRAPHENE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD
trainval/kzhJb5jcH58/50001 I WISH I KNEW HOW TO LET GO SOMETIMES AND REMOVE MYSELF FROM THE MORE AGGRESSIVE PARTS OF
trainval/kzhJb5jcH58/50002 ALL THEY REALLY DO IS GUIDE CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE IN CONFLICT SO THEY CAN COME TO THEIR OWN
trainval/kzhJb5jcH58/50003 SHE FIXED THE DOORKNOB AND THEN OFFERED TO TAKE THE TOOLS BACK DOWNSTAIRS
trainval/kzhJb5jcH58/50004 WE DIDN'T SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS
trainval/kzhJb5jcH58/50005 BUT OF COURSE MY LAZY PERFECTIONIST SELF DOES NOT LIKE BEING REMINDED WHEN I DO THINGS
trainval/kzhJb5jcH58/50006 I CAN'T BELIEVE IT
trainval/KZIGekgoaz4/50001 ANOTHER CHALLENGE IS HEDONIC ADAPTATION
trainval/KZIGekgoaz4/50002 I HAD COME HERE TO BECOME A CANCER SPECIALIST
trainval/KZIGekgoaz4/50003 OUR MIND IS WANDERING
trainval/KZIGekgoaz4/50004 THESE NETWORKS COLLABORATE TO CREATE TWO MODES OF THE BRAIN
trainval/KZIGekgoaz4/50005 THE FIRST MODE OF THE BRAIN IS THE FOCUSED MODE
trainval/KZIGekgoaz4/50006 BUT WE DON'T GIVE OURSELVES ENOUGH DOSES OF THAT
trainval/KZIGekgoaz4/50007 SO RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK TWO TO THREE BILLION PEOPLE ARE WALKING AROUND THE PLANET WITH NO IDEA WHERE THEY ARE
trainval/KZIGekgoaz4/50009 SO I'M SURE YOU'VE EXPERIENCED THIS OR NOT EXPERIENCED THIS
trainval/KZIGekgoaz4/50010 SO WE WERE FOCUSED ON SAFETY AND SURVIVAL
trainval/KZIGekgoaz4/50011 SO THAT IS A CHALLENGE
trainval/KZIGekgoaz4/50012 CAN I TRUST HIM WITH MY CATTLE MY HOUSE MY FAMILY
trainval/KZIGekgoaz4/50013 SO WE DEVELOP A JUDGMENTAL ATTENTION
trainval/KZIGekgoaz4/50014 WHAT SHOULD I DREAD
trainval/KZIGekgoaz4/50015 OR CHASING DEADLINES
trainval/KZIGekgoaz4/50016 MINUS FIVE SECONDS RIGHT
trainval/KZIGekgoaz4/50017 LET'S SAY YOU HAVE NOT MET YOUR PARTNER FOR 30 DAYS
trainval/KZIGekgoaz4/50018 I HAVE FINITE TIME
trainval/KZIGekgoaz4/50019 TWO SUPPORTING IDEAS HERE
trainval/KZIGekgoaz4/50020 THEY WORK 100 PERCENT OF THE TIME
trainval/KZIGekgoaz4/50021 HONEY YOU WERE REALLY RIGHT WHEN YOU
trainval/KZIGekgoaz4/50023 NEVER BEEN ROBBED BEFORE
trainval/KZIGekgoaz4/50024 THESE ARE ALL INTENTIONAL SPRINKLE PRACTICES
trainval/KZIGekgoaz4/50025 THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE SCIENCE DOESN'T KNOW IT
trainval/KZIGekgoaz4/50026 THAT IS WHAT WE NEED AND WE ARE SPRINKLING IT
trainval/kZP8KqrSbcw/50001 WE USED TO BE GOOD AT THRIFTING
trainval/kZP8KqrSbcw/50002 TURNS OUT THERE'S A COMPANY CALLED LAND DETECTOR THAT'S ACTUALLY WORKING IN CHINA AND ALSO SOON IN SOUTH AFRICA THAT'S ABLE
trainval/kZP8KqrSbcw/50003 IT'S THE WATER BOTTLE
trainval/kZP8KqrSbcw/50004 WHY IS THAT INTERESTING
trainval/kZP8KqrSbcw/50006 PLASTICS OFFER ABOUT ONCE OR TWICE OF RECYCLING WHETHER IT'S A BOTTLE WHETHER IT'S A CHAIR WHATEVER IT IS IF
trainval/kZP8KqrSbcw/50007 DESIGN IN THE ABILITY FOR IT TO BE TAKEN APART
trainval/kZP8KqrSbcw/50008 AND WHAT YOU CAN DO THEN IS THE MILK OR THE BACTERIA PRODUCE IN MUCH LARGER VOLUMES AND THEN
trainval/l141Mauo74A/50001 AND SO THE BIG QUESTION THAT I ASKED MYSELF BACK IN DECEMBER OF 2012 IS
trainval/l141Mauo74A/50002 WELL HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME WHO WANT TO BE MENTORS GET REALLY GREAT MATCHES
trainval/l141Mauo74A/50003 AND WHEN I THINK BACK ON ALL OF THE SKILLS AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I'VE GAINED FROM MENTORS THE GREATEST GIFT I
trainval/l1fodZNF1GI/50001 I KNOW IT'S VERY COMPLICATED
trainval/l1fodZNF1GI/50002 THE PRODUCT IS COMPLETELY ADAPTIVE
trainval/l1fodZNF1GI/50003 IN FACT IT BECAME THE OLDEST CONTINUOUSLY OPERATING COMPANY IN THE WORLD
trainval/l1fodZNF1GI/50004 HOW WAS THIS POSSIBLE
trainval/l1SdDWg7XBk/50001 WE USE IT TO DEHUMANIZE THE OTHER OR TO DIFFERENTIATE OURSELVES AND OUR REAL OR PERCEIVED
trainval/L2M15ZeTLxc/50001 FORMAL CHOIRS AND BACKYARD JAMS RECORDING SESSIONS AND BAND PRACTICES
trainval/L2M15ZeTLxc/50002 IT'S BASIC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY
trainval/L2M15ZeTLxc/50003 BUT WHAT IF WE MADE A CONSCIOUS CHOICE TO REVERSE THIS TREND
trainval/L2M15ZeTLxc/50004 WHAT IF WE SURROUNDED OUR SCHOOLS WITH NATIVE PLANTS WHICH ATTRACTED NATIVE ANIMALS WHICH CREATED
trainval/L2M15ZeTLxc/50005 IF I NAME YOU I ASSUME YOU DON'T HAVE A NAME FOR YOURSELF OR IF YOU DO I DON'T CARE
trainval/L2M15ZeTLxc/50006 I'M SHOWING UP AS A LISTENER
trainval/L2M15ZeTLxc/50007 WHO KNOWS HOW FAR WE COULD GO IF WE FUNDED AND CELEBRATED OUR LISTENERS AS MUCH OR MORE THAN OUR SPEECH
trainval/L2M15ZeTLxc/50008 I BELIEVE THAT THAT ONE SIMPLE ACT HAS THE POWER TO ENHANCE OUR INDIVIDUAL WELL BEING AND IMPROVE OUR CHANCES FOR
trainval/l2oywAEJ9hE/50001 PLATO SAID THAT IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR DREAMS THEY CAN ACTUALLY GIVE YOU INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO BEHAVE IN YOUR OWN
trainval/l2oywAEJ9hE/50002 THAT WAS A MESS
trainval/l2oywAEJ9hE/50003 I NEED TO ORDER THIS
trainval/l2oywAEJ9hE/50004 AND IT CREATES AN INCOHERENT STORY LINE I'M SURE MANY OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH
trainval/l2oywAEJ9hE/50005 SO AT FIRST I WAS LIKE THAT'S COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS
trainval/l2oywAEJ9hE/50006 DREAMS FALL INTO A RARE CATEGORY OF SUBJECTS THAT ARE BOTH NON CONFRONTATIONAL AND INTERESTING
trainval/l2oywAEJ9hE/50007 THERE'LL BE AN IMMEDIATE REACTION YOU KNOW PEOPLE SAYING OH WHAT WAS IT
trainval/l2oywAEJ9hE/50008 POLITICS AND ECONOMIC ISSUES AND SOCIAL ISSUES
trainval/l2oywAEJ9hE/50009 ALL OF THEM CREATE BARRIERS BETWEEN PEOPLE RATHER THAN UNIFYING US
trainval/l2oywAEJ9hE/50010 SO ON THE SUBJECT OF EVERYTHING BEING CONNECTED I WOULD ENCOURAGE ALL OF YOU TO GO OUT AND PUT MORE EMPHASIS ON YOUR DREAMS
trainval/l2oywAEJ9hE/50011 THINK ABOUT THEM WRITE THEM DOWN TALK ABOUT THEM WITH PEOPLE
trainval/l2oywAEJ9hE/50012 AND SHE PULLED ME OVER AND I SAID WHAT IT IS
trainval/l2S0V1DeDa4/50001 AND THE TINY WATER CRYSTALS HERE NOW LOOK FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE THEY ARE FROZEN DROPLETS OF
trainval/l2S0V1DeDa4/50002 WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE LIVING ORGANISMS THERE OF COURSE IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT MATTER
trainval/l2S0V1DeDa4/50003 AND THAT WILL HAVE TO AWAIT THE ARRIVAL BACK AT ENCELADUS OF THE SPACECRAFTS
trainval/l2S0V1DeDa4/50004 WE'VE FLOWN THE CASSINI SPACECRAFT BY THIS MOON NOW SEVERAL TIMES FLYING
trainval/L2upTRjXeJM/50001 CASE IN POINT
trainval/L2upTRjXeJM/50002 THE GLOBAL MEDIA MONITORING PROJECT HAS FOUND THAT STORIES BY FEMALE REPORTERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO CHALLENGE
trainval/L2upTRjXeJM/50003 AND SHE WORKED WITH AN EDITOR AT NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO TO TRY TO GET A STORY AIRED NATIONALLY
trainval/L2upTRjXeJM/50004 PUTTING THEM THERE MADE THEM MORE RECOGNIZABLE
trainval/L2upTRjXeJM/50005 A RECENT GLOBAL SURVEY FOUND THAT 73 PERCENT OF THE TOP MEDIA MANAGEMENT JOBS ARE STILL HELD BY MEN
trainval/L2upTRjXeJM/50006 BUT THIS IS ALSO ABOUT SOMETHING FAR MORE COMPLEX
trainval/L51h8BBu7b8/50001 TURBULENT RELATIONSHIPS WITH HIS FAMILY LED HIM TO TO BE THROWN OUT
trainval/L51h8BBu7b8/50002 IN HIS MID 20S HE HAD A BREAKDOWN
trainval/L51h8BBu7b8/50003 YOU SEE EVERYONE WANTS SOCIETY TO CHANGE
trainval/L51h8BBu7b8/50004 WHAT MATTERS IS WHAT YOU BELIEVE
trainval/L51h8BBu7b8/50005 GIVE PRAISE FOR THE PARTS OF YOUR BODY THAT ARE WORKING
trainval/L51h8BBu7b8/50006 MAYBE EXERCISE A LITTLE BIT
trainval/L51h8BBu7b8/50007 WE WORKED ON HER BELIEF SYSTEM
trainval/L51h8BBu7b8/50008 SELF MASTERY THIS IS YOUR INNER WORK
trainval/L51h8BBu7b8/50009 MAKE SURE YOU WRITE IT DOWN
trainval/L51h8BBu7b8/50010 STAY BEHIND LATER
trainval/l5Bbg96VODk/50001 COMPARE THAT TO JUST 30 EIGHT YEARS AGO
trainval/l5Bbg96VODk/50003 WHERE MEMBERS OF STAFF SUFFERED POST TRAUMATIC STRESS AS A RESULT OF A CONSTANT VIOLENCE AND DYSFUNCTION
trainval/l5Bbg96VODk/50004 EIGHT YEARS ON AND OUR SCHOOL IS ALMOST UNRECOGNIZABLE
trainval/l5Bbg96VODk/50005 THE VIOLENCE AND THE APATHY TOWARDS EDUCATION TOO
trainval/l5Bbg96VODk/50006 AND OUR BOYS WELL THEY WEAR THEIR UNIFORM WITH GREAT PRIDE
trainval/l5Bbg96VODk/50007 THEY WANT TO BE AT THIS SCHOOL
trainval/l5Bbg96VODk/50008 MY FATHER NEVER HAD THE CHANCE TO FINISH HIS SCHOOLING AND YET HE REMAINS AS ONE OF THE GREATEST TEACHERS THAT I'VE EVER
trainval/l5Bbg96VODk/50009 A SCHOOL WHERE TOO MANY PEOPLE HAD GIVEN UP ON
trainval/l5Bbg96VODk/50010 I HEARD ALL SORTS OF STORIES BEFORE I STARTED THERE
trainval/l5Bbg96VODk/50011 YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME
trainval/l5Bbg96VODk/50012 ONCE THRIVING IT HAD LOST ITS WAY
trainval/l5Bbg96VODk/50013 THAT A FAMILY IS THERE FOR YOU
trainval/l5Bbg96VODk/50014 WE WERE THERE FOR THEM WHEN THEY FELL
trainval/l5Bbg96VODk/50015 WE TRIED TO CATCH THEM DOING THE RIGHT THING AND ACKNOWLEDGE THEM FOR THAT
trainval/l5Bbg96VODk/50016 AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/l5Bbg96VODk/50017 AND YEP YOU GUESSED IT
trainval/l5Bbg96VODk/50019 SO DID ALL THIS TINKERING AND REVIEWING AND ENGAGING AND ALL THAT SORT OF STUFF ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE ACADEMICALLY
trainval/l5Bbg96VODk/50020 LAST YEAR 65 OF OUR BOYS WENT ON TO FURTHER EDUCATION
trainval/l5Bbg96VODk/50021 HE HAD MY BACK
trainval/l5Bbg96VODk/50022 THE POSITIVITY IS INFECTIOUS AND SUPERSTARS WELL THEY'RE MADE UP OF ORDINARY PEOPLE
trainval/l5Bbg96VODk/50023 WHERE REGARDLESS OF WHERE A SCHOOL SITS ON SOME SIMPLISTIC RANKING SYSTEM
trainval/l5d8GW6GdR0/50001 SO IF WE WANT TO MAKE AN IMPACT ON CLIMATE CHANGE WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT BUILDINGS
trainval/l5d8GW6GdR0/50002 SO SOME SOCIAL SCIENTISTS WERE THINKING HOW DO WE GET HOMEOWNERS TO REDUCE THEIR ENERGY CONSUMPTION
trainval/l5d8GW6GdR0/50003 THEY SENT AUDITORS OUT TO LOOK AT PEOPLE'S HOMES
trainval/l5d8GW6GdR0/50004 SO FRAMING LOSS CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE
trainval/l5d8GW6GdR0/50005 ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON FOR DECADES IS TRYING TO REDUCE LITTERING TRYING TO GET US TO PUT OUR TRASH AND OUR WASTE
trainval/l5d8GW6GdR0/50006 SO STOP TRYING TO CHANGE IT
trainval/l5d8GW6GdR0/50007 WHEN PEOPLE ENGAGE IN THE BEHAVIORS YOU WANT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO MEASURE THE ATTITUDES YOU EXPECT
trainval/l5d8GW6GdR0/50008 SO DON'T CHANGE ATTITUDES SET BEHAVIORAL EXPECTATIONS
trainval/l5d8GW6GdR0/50009 THEY ALSO CARE ABOUT BUILDING GREEN BUILDINGS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT IT SAVES RESOURCES LIKE ELECTRICITY AND
trainval/l5d8GW6GdR0/50010 WHAT THEY REALLY SHOULD BE DOING IS BRINGING THEIR FRIEND WITH THEM AND ASKING THEIR FRIEND TO COME BY EVERY FIVE
trainval/l5d8GW6GdR0/50011 ANYTIME THERE'S NO ACTION CAN YOU JUST WALK BY AND DROP SOMETHING IN
trainval/l5d8GW6GdR0/50012 THAT'S THE GREATEST PREDICTOR
trainval/l5d8GW6GdR0/50013 WHAT'S WRONG WITH A IS THAT IT SETS THE INADVERTENT NORM THE BEHAVIOR THAT YOU'RE NOT
trainval/l5d8GW6GdR0/50014 MAKE YOUR CHANGE MEANINGFUL
trainval/l5d8GW6GdR0/50015 YOU MIGHT BE TRYING TO IMPROVE HEALTH YOU MIGHT BE TRYING TO CHANGE THE ENVIRONMENT ALL OF
trainval/l5d8GW6GdR0/50016 WE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL
trainval/l5d8GW6GdR0/50017 BUT YOU WILL BE THE LEAST SUCCESSFUL IF YOU LET COMMON SENSE BE YOUR GUIDE
trainval/l5d8GW6GdR0/50018 SO THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SHARE IT WITH YOU TODAY
trainval/l5d8GW6GdR0/50019 PLEASE USE IT IN YOUR LIVES
trainval/l5ZJ6bK1EIc/50001 WHERE DO WE LIKE TO KISS PEOPLE
trainval/l5ZJ6bK1EIc/50002 THEY NEED PSYCHIATRIC HELP
trainval/l5ZJ6bK1EIc/50003 MAX HAS KINDLY DONATED HIS PHOTOGRAPH TO ME
trainval/l5ZJ6bK1EIc/50005 WE CAN CATEGORIZE IT LIKE THAT
trainval/L6N06hTuESE/50003 EDISON JUST CONNECTED THE DOTS FOR A LONG TIME TO MAKE AN ELECTRIC BULB
trainval/L6N06hTuESE/50004 WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
trainval/L6N06hTuESE/50006 IT SEEMS THAT SOMETIMES THE THINGS MAY BE OBTAINED DISCOVERIES CAN BE FOUND DOTS
trainval/L6N06hTuESE/50007 WE CAN RECONNECT THE SPOTS AND SO WE SEE THE ANIMAL
trainval/L6N06hTuESE/50008 WE THEREOF MAKE SOME ERRORS
trainval/L6N06hTuESE/50009 THEN ACCIDENTALLY BY PLAYING WITH HIPPOCAMPUS HE FOUND THAT SOME CELLS WHICH RESPOND ONLY WHEN THE
trainval/L6N06hTuESE/50010 WE DID NOT KNOW HOW THE MAP IS CONSTRUCTED
trainval/L6N06hTuESE/50012 IT ALWAYS COMES TO THE WALL
trainval/L6N06hTuESE/50013 USUALLY THE SCIENTISTS SHOW SOME GRAPHS OR SOME
trainval/L6N06hTuESE/50015 HOW DO WE KNOW IT
trainval/L6PW0Nw35X0/50001 THE RAT COMES OUT
trainval/L6PW0Nw35X0/50003 NOW HERE IS THE QUESTION
trainval/L6PW0Nw35X0/50004 EVENTUALLY THE RATS FIND THEIR WAY BUT THE HUMAN BEINGS WILL GO DOWN THE FOURTH TUNNEL
trainval/L6PW0Nw35X0/50005 I MEAN WE REPEAT THE SAME THINGS OVER AND OVER AGAIN
trainval/L6PW0Nw35X0/50006 WE BELIEVE THAT THE ONLY POSSIBLE CHOICE AFTER SCHOOL IS UNIVERSITY THE ONLY POSSIBLE
trainval/L6PW0Nw35X0/50008 THE RAT GOES DOWN THE FOURTH TUNNEL THERE'S NO CHEESE IN THE FOURTH TUNNEL
trainval/L6PW0Nw35X0/50009 WE WANT TO FIGURE IT OUT
trainval/L6PW0Nw35X0/50010 WE WANT TO SOLVE THIS PART BUT SCRAMBLE THE OTHER PART
trainval/L7CqpVQDL0E/50001 WE NEED TO REMOVE IT FROM THAT MYSTERIOUS PLACE IT SEEMS TO EXIST AND SETTLE IT MORE CLEARLY
trainval/L7CqpVQDL0E/50002 AND WHILE IT DOES MOST OF THE TIME SOMETIMES IT DOES NOT AND WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT
trainval/l92bqJNkIao/50001 THEY SHOULD BE ASKED WHAT THEY THINK AND WHAT THEY WANT AND SOMETIMES DEVELOPMENTS WILL PUT IN A SLIDE
trainval/l92bqJNkIao/50002 WITH DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY
trainval/l92bqJNkIao/50003 SO THIS IS WHAT WE DO THIS IS WHAT JOE AND I DO
trainval/l92bqJNkIao/50004 WE GRADUATED A YEAR AGO FROM UNIVERSITY AND IT WAS PART OF JOE'S FINAL YEAR PROJECT
trainval/l92bqJNkIao/50005 SO THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR WORKSHOPS THE KIDS WILL SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES AND THE IDEAS AND WHAT THEY LIKE AND
trainval/l92bqJNkIao/50007 THEY JUST WANT TO SAY WHAT THEY THINK AND THEY'RE NOT REALLY WILLING TO BE OPEN MINDED ABOUT THE
trainval/l92bqJNkIao/50008 WE'VE STARTED TO INCLUDE ADULTS IN THIS PROCESS AS WELL
trainval/l92bqJNkIao/50009 SO A FEW WEEKS AGO WE DID A BIG PROJECT FOR THE BRIGHTON COUNCIL
trainval/l92bqJNkIao/50010 THEY'RE LOUD AND THEY'RE NOISY BUT IT'S IN A REALLY POSITIVE WAY AND IT WORKS REALLY WELL
trainval/l92bqJNkIao/50011 IT SHOULDN'T BE THIS WAY
trainval/L9Sc1j9VRwE/50001 HAITI WAS SOMETHING WE HADN'T SEEN BEFORE
trainval/L9Sc1j9VRwE/50002 OUT OF THIS RUBBLE OF HAITI AND FROM THIS DEVASTATION CAME SOMETHING THAT WE CALL TERA THE TRILOGY
trainval/L9Sc1j9VRwE/50003 IN MONGOLIA FOR INSTANCE WHERE 30 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ARE NOMADIC SMS INFORMATION SYSTEMS ARE
trainval/lAzQWtkPzbI/50001 THINK ABOUT INSECTS
trainval/lAzQWtkPzbI/50002 MANY TIMES THEY ARE PROTEINS
trainval/lbBDoFp2HIQ/50001 AT THE END OF A BUSY DAY WHEN I WAS AN HOUR BEHIND I LOOKED AT THE CLOCK IT WAS 4
trainval/lbBDoFp2HIQ/50002 ESSENTIALLY I WAS STILL CURIOUS
trainval/lbBDoFp2HIQ/50003 PUZZLED I SCROLLED THE IMAGES MYSELF
trainval/lbBDoFp2HIQ/50004 WHY IS THAT
trainval/lbBDoFp2HIQ/50005 WHAT IT ALSO DOES IS IT LOOKS FOR LEVERAGE POINTS SMALL ACTIONS THAT HAVE
trainval/lbBDoFp2HIQ/50006 IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES THE FOLLOWING QUESTION
trainval/lbBDoFp2HIQ/50007 SO FROM THE MOMENT WE GET INTO MEDICAL SCHOOL IT'S A DEEP CULTURE OF COMPETITION
trainval/lbBDoFp2HIQ/50008 ARE WE READY TO ACCEPT THIS
trainval/lbIh6yngKHo/50001 THAT MEANS PROGRAMMING THEM
trainval/lbIh6yngKHo/50002 CHORUS CHORUS VERSE ETC
trainval/lbIh6yngKHo/50003 SO THE BIGGEST EFFECT THAT WE'VE SEEN HAS BEEN FOR WOMEN AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATINOS
trainval/lbIh6yngKHo/50004 IN PROGRAMMING IN EARSKETCH WE OFTEN USE DATA STRUCTURES AS WAYS OF HOLDING COLLECTIONS OF
trainval/LbIXYEW9CSQ/50002 AND SO WE ALLOWED MULTINATIONALS INTO INDIA
trainval/lbnVu3AtS0o/50001 WELL WHEN I'M NOT FIGHTING THE CODED GAZE AS A POET OF CODE I'M A GRADUATE STUDENT AT THE
trainval/LBvHI1awWaI/50001 AND WHILE THIS GOLDFISH LIVES IN A VERY SAFE ENVIRONMENT IT'S ALSO VERY LIMITING IN MOST EVERY WAY
trainval/LBvHI1awWaI/50002 WE SEE CHAOS OCCUR AT TIMES IN BUSINESS MERGERS NATURAL DISASTERS AND HORRIFIC EVENTS LIKE 9 11
trainval/LCuAu67OCDk/50001 THEY MUST WEAR ALL WHITE AFTER THEIR HUSBANDS DIE FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES
trainval/LCuAu67OCDk/50002 ISLAM ALSO FURTHER INCREASES A WOMAN'S AUTONOMY BY GIVING HER MARITAL RIGHTS
trainval/LCuAu67OCDk/50003 AND HISTORICAL RECORDS ALSO SHOW THAT PROPHET MUHAMMAD WOULD CONSULT WOMEN ON DECISIONS
trainval/LCuAu67OCDk/50004 I MEAN NOT ONLY DID MY PEERS QUESTION MY LEGITIMACY BUT AIRPORT SECURITY
trainval/LCuAu67OCDk/50005 I BELIEVE IN WOMENS' RIGHTS EQUALITY AND FREEDOM
trainval/LCuAu67OCDk/50006 NOW BEFORE I LEAVE YOU TODAY I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT A MOMENT IN MY LIFE
trainval/LCxcnUrokJo/50001 TODAY IT'S LESS THAN TWO PERCENT
trainval/LCxcnUrokJo/50002 WHY ARE THERE SO FEW FARMERS TODAY
trainval/LCxcnUrokJo/50003 MANY OF THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE NOW WORK
trainval/LCxcnUrokJo/50004 THERE WILL BE JOBS
trainval/LCxcnUrokJo/50005 DOES THAT MEAN THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT
trainval/LCxcnUrokJo/50006 NOW I STARTED THIS TALK WITH A PARADOX
trainval/LCxcnUrokJo/50007 WHY DOESN'T THAT MAKE OUR LABOR SUPERFLUOUS OUR SKILLS REDUNDANT
trainval/lcZyzcTS5GU/50001 WITH YOUR BACK AGAINST THE BARS WHICH CONFINE YOU AND YOUR SOUL FREE FROM THE SHACKLES WHICH HELD YOU BOUND
trainval/lcZyzcTS5GU/50002 I KNOW WE WILL MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME AS WE WALK THROUGH THIS WORLD HAND IN HAND
trainval/lcZyzcTS5GU/50003 MY CALL TO ACTION TODAY IS A VERY SIMPLE ONE IT WOULD REQUIRE ONLY A RULE CHANGE AND THAT WOULD BE TO
trainval/lD69n6Ur2P8/50001 I ESCAPED I RAN HOME IN TEARS
trainval/lD69n6Ur2P8/50002 AND LUCKILY FOR ME THAT DAY MY FATHER WAS HOME EARLY
trainval/lD69n6Ur2P8/50003 WHERE ARE THEY
trainval/lD69n6Ur2P8/50004 IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER IF YOU AGREE WITH THIS OR NOT
trainval/lD69n6Ur2P8/50005 NOW HERE'S A COOL THING ABOUT YOUR VOICE
trainval/ldhppc7GmZg/50001 HE'S FEELING PRETTY AWESOME TODAY
trainval/ldhppc7GmZg/50002 IT'S BEEN A REAL PLEASURE TO BE ABLE TO SHARE MY STORY
trainval/LdjNw8SZc5U/50001 YES I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU TAKE ME AS AS THE INTELLIGENCE THAT HB HAS BUT FROM FRACTIONS TO DECIMALS I AIN'T DUMB
trainval/LdjNw8SZc5U/50002 AND IF YOU'RE HAVING A NUMBER PROBLEM I FEEL BAD FOR YOU SON
trainval/LdjNw8SZc5U/50003 I'M BREAK IT DOWN FOR THE PI SOLO LIKE 3
trainval/LdjNw8SZc5U/50004 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/LdjNw8SZc5U/50005 AND IF I WAS A T
trainval/LdjNw8SZc5U/50007 LIKE IF YOU'RE WITH A DINOSAUR EVERYTHING ELSE SEEMS SECONDARY
trainval/LdjNw8SZc5U/50008 THE THING WITH DINOSAURS IS DINOSAURS ARE KIND OF AWESOME MORE THAN THAT THEY ACTUALLY EXISTED
trainval/LdjNw8SZc5U/50009 YES MY LOVE IS REAL
trainval/LdjNw8SZc5U/50010 THIS AIN'T NO DAMSEL IN DISTRESS TRAPPED PRINCESS DRAGON SLAYING QUEST BECAUSE 1 DRAGONS NEVER HAPPENED 2 MOST
trainval/lDq9SQxvsNU/50001 IT REQUIRES THAT EVERYONE TREAT CHOICE AS A PRIVATE AND SELF DEFINING
trainval/lDq9SQxvsNU/50002 I'M AWARE OF THIS CUSTOM
trainval/lDq9SQxvsNU/50003 COM WITH WHAT IS IT
trainval/lDq9SQxvsNU/50004 AND ONE WAS CALLED BALLET SLIPPERS
trainval/lDq9SQxvsNU/50005 AND THE OTHER ONE WAS CALLED ADORABLE
trainval/lDq9SQxvsNU/50006 WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THEM
trainval/lDq9SQxvsNU/50007 AND I BROUGHT WOMEN INTO THE LABORATORY AND I ASKED THEM WHICH ONE WOULD YOU PICK
trainval/lDq9SQxvsNU/50008 HOW DID THEY GET ME TO DO THAT
trainval/lECfUfqNVoo/50001 WHAT IS HAPPINESS ACCORDING TO YOU
trainval/lECfUfqNVoo/50002 THIS USED TO BE SOMETHING THAT CONFLICTED MY THOUGHTS AND LIFE
trainval/lECfUfqNVoo/50003 SO I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF ANY OF YOU ASKED ME
trainval/lECfUfqNVoo/50004 HOW SURE ARE YOU THAT WHAT SOCIETY PERCEIVES TO BE THE CHILD LEFT BEHIND IS WHAT'S NOT
trainval/LETgWDSSzSI/50001 AND I'M TALKING STRAIGHT UP WELFARE
trainval/LETgWDSSzSI/50002 MONTHLY CASH ASSISTANCE HOUSING ALLOWANCE FOOD STAMPS WEEKLY TRIPS TO THE FOOD
trainval/LETgWDSSzSI/50003 IT'S THE KIND OF LIFE YOU EXPECTED
trainval/LETgWDSSzSI/50004 IT'S WHAT YOU WERE EXPOSED TO AS A YOUNG CHILD
trainval/LETgWDSSzSI/50005 IT WAS ALREADY YOUR LIVED EXPERIENCE
trainval/LETgWDSSzSI/50006 YOU ALL HAVE THE POWER TO DO THAT
trainval/LETgWDSSzSI/50007 INDIVIDUALS LIKE MY FIRST GRADE TEACHER WHO ALWAYS TOLD ME HOW SMART I WAS AND HOW LUCKY
trainval/LETgWDSSzSI/50008 WHAT A POWERFUL MESSAGE TO SEND TO A YOUNG PERSON
trainval/LETgWDSSzSI/50009 IT'S ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE ACHIEVE THE GOALS THAT THEY WANT TO ACHIEVE AND NOT DETERMINING WHAT THEIR GOALS SHOULD
trainval/LETgWDSSzSI/50010 IT WAS A COUPLE WEEKS BEFORE THE WINTER HOLIDAYS AND A COLLEAGUE CAME FORWARD
trainval/LETgWDSSzSI/50011 AND LATER THAT DAY THAT STUDENT CAME DOWN TO MY OFFICE JUST COMPLETELY UPSET
trainval/LETgWDSSzSI/50012 HE STARTED PACING BACK AND FORTH AND I ASKED HIM WHAT'S GOING ON
trainval/LETgWDSSzSI/50013 AND I LOOKED AT HIM AND HIS EYES WELLED UP WITH TEARS AND HE SAID MAN THESE PEOPLE DON'T
trainval/LETgWDSSzSI/50014 I DON'T WANT TO HAVE A NICE CHRISTMAS
trainval/LETgWDSSzSI/50015 I WANT SOMEONE TO LOVE ME MAKE ME FEEL LIKE I MATTER MAKE ME BELIEVE I CAN BE SOMEBODY INSTEAD OF MAKING ME
trainval/LETgWDSSzSI/50016 AND I AM PROOF OF THAT
trainval/LETgWDSSzSI/50017 I WOULDN'T BE STANDING HERE PROUDLY TODAY HAD OTHERS NOT BELIEVED IN ME AND SHOWN ME THE WAY
trainval/LETgWDSSzSI/50018 SO AS MAHATMA GANDHI SAID BE THE CHANGE THAT YOU WISH TO SEE IN THE WORLD
trainval/LETgWDSSzSI/50019 AND THAT IS TRULY HOW I LIVE MY LIFE BOTH PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY
trainval/LETgWDSSzSI/50020 SHE WANTED TO BE AN ADVOCATE FOR THOSE SHE CONSIDERED VOICELESS BECAUSE SHE SAID THEIR NEEDS
trainval/LEzsELPNmr4/50001 JUST LOOK AT THE SURFACE
trainval/lfBpsV1Hwqs/50001 YOU WEREN'T GOING TO HAVE THEM ANYWAY
trainval/lfBpsV1Hwqs/50002 WASTE OF LIFE
trainval/lfBpsV1Hwqs/50003 I DON'T WANT GAMERS TO REGRET THE TIME THEY SPENT PLAYING TIME THAT I ENCOURAGED THEM TO SPEND
trainval/lfBpsV1Hwqs/50004 NOW LET ME TELL YOU THAT STORY
trainval/lfBpsV1Hwqs/50005 NOW WHY A GAME
trainval/lfBpsV1Hwqs/50006 IT JUST VANISHED
trainval/lfBpsV1Hwqs/50007 I MEAN IF IT HADN'T WORKED FOR ME THERE'S NO WAY I WOULD HAVE BELIEVED IT WAS POSSIBLE
trainval/lfBpsV1Hwqs/50008 I UNDERSTAND MYSELF BETTER
trainval/lfBpsV1Hwqs/50009 I KNOW WHO I REALLY AM NOW
trainval/lfBpsV1Hwqs/50010 I HAVE A NEW SENSE OF MEANING AND PURPOSE IN MY LIFE
trainval/lfBpsV1Hwqs/50011 BUT HOW DOES IT WORK
trainval/lfBpsV1Hwqs/50012 HOW DO YOU GET FROM TRAUMA TO GROWTH
trainval/lfBpsV1Hwqs/50013 AND I FEEL LIKE YOU CAN DO IT
trainval/lfBpsV1Hwqs/50014 I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOU
trainval/lfBpsV1Hwqs/50015 SO EVERYBODY READY
trainval/lfBpsV1Hwqs/50016 THAT'S ALL IT TAKES
trainval/lfBpsV1Hwqs/50017 EVERY SINGLE SECOND THAT YOU ARE NOT SITTING STILL YOU ARE ACTIVELY IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF YOUR HEART AND
trainval/lfBpsV1Hwqs/50018 IT GETS STRONGER THE MORE YOU EXERCISE IT
trainval/lfBpsV1Hwqs/50019 SO TACKLING A TINY CHALLENGE WITHOUT GIVING UP EVEN ONE AS ABSURD AS SNAPPING YOUR FINGERS
trainval/lfBpsV1Hwqs/50020 PRETTY CLEVER RIGHT
trainval/lfBpsV1Hwqs/50021 SO IF YOU SPEND THESE SEVEN AND A HALF MINUTES TODAY DOING SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOU
trainval/LFJ9WAHowcg/50001 BUT WHY DOES THE EARTH GO AROUND THE SUN
trainval/LFJ9WAHowcg/50002 BUT IF YOU'RE ANYTHING LIKE ME YOU'LL WANT TO SEE SOME OF THAT FOR YOURSELF SO LET ME SHOW YOU
trainval/LFJ9WAHowcg/50003 AND SO I COME TO MY WISH
trainval/lfrG2bidW5g/50001 MEXICO CAN'T FIX DRUG TRAFFICKING
trainval/lfrG2bidW5g/50002 EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN ONE COUNTRY SOONER OR LATER HAS AN IMPACT ON THINGS IN OTHER COUNTRIES
trainval/lfrG2bidW5g/50003 THAT'S THE 21ST CENTURY WORLD
trainval/lfrG2bidW5g/50004 ONE OR TWO PEOPLE SAID I HAD NO IDEA MY COUNTRY CONTRIBUTED SO MUCH
trainval/lfykytI3A6k/50001 BY PREVENTING THEM FROM THEIR OPPRESSION
trainval/lfykytI3A6k/50002 AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO
trainval/LgBjU8ovWh0/50001 RELAX YOUR FACE
trainval/LgBjU8ovWh0/50002 AND THAT SEPARATION HAS BROUGHT FEELINGS AND THOUGHTS OF UNWORTHINESS
trainval/LgBjU8ovWh0/50003 WHO AM I TO CHANGE THE WORLD
trainval/LgBjU8ovWh0/50004 AND WE CAN STEER OUR PERSONAL LIVES TO ITS GOAL THAT WE WANT AND THAT IS IN HARMONY WITH WHO WE
trainval/LgBjU8ovWh0/50005 IF YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH CLOSING YOUR EYES THAT'S FINE
trainval/LgBjU8ovWh0/50006 HOW SHOULD I LIVE
trainval/LgBjU8ovWh0/50008 WHAT DID YOU DO WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD
trainval/LgBjU8ovWh0/50009 LET US ALL WORK OUR OWN PATH TOWARDS HOW WE WANT THE WORLD TO BE
trainval/LgBjU8ovWh0/50010 AT THAT MOMENT I MADE A DECISION
trainval/lGbuCmuTJHg/50001 BUT I'M NOT ALONE
trainval/lGbuCmuTJHg/50002 I ADMITTED I HAD A PROBLEM
trainval/lGbuCmuTJHg/50003 AND I CHOSE TO LIVE
trainval/LgntY0dOfSc/50001 THEY ARE SMALL YOU CAN'T SEE THEM
trainval/LgntY0dOfSc/50002 THEY ARE A FRACTION OF A MILLIMETER
trainval/LgntY0dOfSc/50003 WE USE MICROSCOPES TO SEE THEM
trainval/LgntY0dOfSc/50004 I TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY BEHAVE HOW THEY FUNCTION THESE CANCER CELLS
trainval/LgntY0dOfSc/50005 I AM RUNNING OUT TRYING TO CATCH A MEETING OR WHATEVER
trainval/LgntY0dOfSc/50006 ABOUT TEN MINUTES LATER I FIND THE HOOD RELEASE
trainval/LgntY0dOfSc/50007 THERE IS PROBABLY SOMETHING WRONG BEHIND IT
trainval/LgntY0dOfSc/50008 MAYBE THE ENGINE IS BROKEN MAYBE THE CARBURETOR FELL OFF OR THE STEERING WHEEL
trainval/LgntY0dOfSc/50009 SO WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS I AM TALKING ABOUT
trainval/LgntY0dOfSc/50011 SO MY LABORATORY MAKES VIDEOS OF CANCER CELLS AND WE LOOK AT HOW THEY FUNCTION THESE ARE SORT
trainval/LgntY0dOfSc/50012 THESE ARE THE SYMPTOMS WE HAVE GROWTH AND WE HAVE SPREAD OR MOVEMENT
trainval/LgntY0dOfSc/50013 SO I KIND OF WANT TO THROW OUT SOME STATISTICS TO YOU THAT ARE KIND OF SCARY FOR ME KIND OF FRIGHTENING
trainval/LgntY0dOfSc/50014 BUT WHAT ABOUT CANCER WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR
trainval/LgntY0dOfSc/50015 THIS IS THE IMPORTANT POINT
trainval/LgntY0dOfSc/50016 AND THAT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WE WORK ON IS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS AS CANCER
trainval/LgntY0dOfSc/50017 THESE GUYS ARE TINY LIKE A FRACTION OF A MILLIMETER
trainval/LgntY0dOfSc/50018 HOW DO I PICK WHAT I WANT
trainval/LgntY0dOfSc/50019 HOW DO I KNOW WHICH IS THE BAD CANCER CELL
trainval/LgntY0dOfSc/50020 HOW DO I KNOW WHICH IS THE RINGLEADER
trainval/LgntY0dOfSc/50021 THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO HERE
trainval/LgntY0dOfSc/50023 THESE CHANGES ARE KNOWN AS MUTATIONS
trainval/LgntY0dOfSc/50024 SO WE CAN UNCOVER THE MOLECULAR MUTATIONS FOR EVERYBODY'S CANCER
trainval/LgntY0dOfSc/50025 PREVIOUSLY WE SAID LUNG CANCER BREAST CANCER PROSTATE CANCER
trainval/LgntY0dOfSc/50026 WE ARE THINKING ABOUT CANCERS ENTIRELY DIFFERENTLY
trainval/LgntY0dOfSc/50027 WE HAVE A TREATMENT FOR IT
trainval/LGtNFHtM81A/50001 SO I WASN'T BUYING IT
trainval/LH8MPbFoRjw/50002 I'VE SPENT MOST OF MY CAREER RESEARCHING THESE PROGRAMS
trainval/LH8MPbFoRjw/50003 I'VE TALKED TO A LOT OF DIRECTORS OF STATE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES ABOUT THESE ISSUES A LOT OF LEGISLATORS ABOUT THESE ISSUES
trainval/LH8MPbFoRjw/50004 WHEN LEGISLATORS AND OTHERS THINK ABOUT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WHAT THEY FIRST OF ALL THINK ABOUT ARE BUSINESS TAX
trainval/LH8MPbFoRjw/50005 THEY HAND OUT ALL KINDS OF BUSINESS TAX BREAKS
trainval/LH8MPbFoRjw/50006 NOW THOSE PROGRAMS CAN MAKE SENSE IF THEY IN FACT INDUCE NEW LOCATION DECISIONS AND THE WAY THEY CAN
trainval/LH8MPbFoRjw/50007 IT'S A SOMEWHAT MORE INDIRECT WAY
trainval/LH8MPbFoRjw/50008 SPECIFICALLY THE INTERDEPENDENCY HERE IS IS THAT THERE ARE HUGE
trainval/LH8MPbFoRjw/50009 SO WHEN YOU LOOK FOR EXAMPLE AT METROPOLITAN AREAS SUCH AS THE BOSTON AREA MINNEAPOLIS ST
trainval/LH8MPbFoRjw/50010 IT'S NOT EXACTLY A LOW COST PROPOSITION
trainval/LH8MPbFoRjw/50011 THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS A LOT ON ITS PLATE AND STATE GOVERNMENTS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO STEP UP
trainval/LH8MPbFoRjw/50012 SO CLEARLY THE PRODUCTIVITY OF FIRMS IN SILICON VALLEY HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE SKILLS NOT ONLY OF THE WORKERS AT
trainval/LH8MPbFoRjw/50013 ANOTHER OBJECTION USED SOMETIMES HERE TO INVEST IN EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS IS CONCERN
trainval/LH8MPbFoRjw/50014 AND SO THEY'LL BOTH UNDERINVEST BECAUSE EVERYONE'S GOING TO MOVE OUT
trainval/LH8MPbFoRjw/50015 OR AT LEAST ENOUGH OF THEM WILL STAY THAT IT WILL PAY OFF FOR YOUR STATE ECONOMY
trainval/LH8MPbFoRjw/50016 WELL ONE OBVIOUS BARRIER IS COST
trainval/LH8MPbFoRjw/50017 AT LEAST I HOPE NOT
trainval/LH8MPbFoRjw/50019 IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE STILL INVESTED IN THAT YOU STILL BELIEVE IN THE NOTION OF INVESTMENT
trainval/LH8MPbFoRjw/50020 THAT IS THE NOTION OF INVESTMENT
trainval/LH8MPbFoRjw/50021 YOU SACRIFICE NOW FOR A RETURN LATER
trainval/Lh9lDWPMWrM/50001 AND WE NEED VITAMIN D
trainval/Lh9lDWPMWrM/50002 IT'S NOW A REQUIREMENT THAT CHILDREN HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT
trainval/Lh9lDWPMWrM/50003 MY GRANDMOTHER GREW UP IN GLASGOW BACK IN THE 1920S AND 30S WHEN RICKETS WAS A REAL PROBLEM AND COD
trainval/Lh9lDWPMWrM/50004 AND THAT REALLY PREVENTED THE RICKETS THAT USED TO BE COMMON IN THIS CITY
trainval/Lh9lDWPMWrM/50005 AND I AS A CHILD WAS FED COD LIVER OIL BY MY GRANDMOTHER
trainval/Lh9lDWPMWrM/50006 HIGH VITAMIN D LEVELS I THINK ARE A MARKER FOR SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE AND SUNLIGHT
trainval/Lh9lDWPMWrM/50007 IT ALSO DILATES THE CORONARY ARTERIES SO IT STOPS ANGINA
trainval/Lh9lDWPMWrM/50008 SO IT'S NOT JUST IN THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM IT ARISES
trainval/Lh9lDWPMWrM/50009 IT ARISES IN THE SKIN
trainval/Lh9lDWPMWrM/50010 HOW DO YOU HAVE LOW BLOOD PRESSURE IN YOUR SKIN
trainval/Lh9lDWPMWrM/50011 WE COULDN'T TURN OFF THE NITRIC OXIDE
trainval/Lh9lDWPMWrM/50012 IF YOUR LEG IS CHOPPED OFF AND YOU LOSE BLOOD YOUR BODY WILL CLAMP DOWN INCREASE THE HEART RATE DO EVERYTHING IT CAN TO KEEP YOUR
trainval/Lh9lDWPMWrM/50013 IN WINTER OR SUMMER IT'S THE SAME AMOUNT OF LIGHT
trainval/Lh9lDWPMWrM/50014 WE THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
trainval/LhjsRjC6B8U/50002 WHY WAS THIS SO NORMAL
trainval/LhjsRjC6B8U/50003 WOMEN ARE EQUAL NOW MORE OR LESS
trainval/LhjsRjC6B8U/50004 IF WOMEN ARE EQUAL NOW THEN TO TALK ABOUT SEXISM TO COMPLAIN ABOUT SEXISM MUST BE OVERREACTING
trainval/lhP52caGW6s/50001 I THINK WE SHOULD PERHAPS DO A BIT MORE OF IT
trainval/lhP52caGW6s/50002 THEY GET A BAD RAP
trainval/lhP52caGW6s/50003 THEY ARE IN FACT THE MOST DIVERSE EVOCATIVE POETIC ASPECT OF NATURE
trainval/lhP52caGW6s/50004 AND YOU'LL SEE THEM AROUND WHERE YOU LIVE
trainval/lhqYBhLh1IM/50002 ARE YOU MARRIED TO A JAPANESE
trainval/lhqYBhLh1IM/50003 I OFTEN REPLY WITH
trainval/lhqYBhLh1IM/50005 BUT WHAT I REALLY WANT TO SAY IS
trainval/LhszKevcH30/50001 RECORD DIGGING IS A LIFESTYLE
trainval/LhszKevcH30/50002 MY PARENTS USED TO GIVE ME MONEY TO EAT AND ON MOST DAYS INSTEAD OF EATING I WOULD SAVE IT AND BUY MYSELF A RECORD AT
trainval/LhszKevcH30/50003 AS A YOUNG MAN HE PLAYED AND TOURED WITH LIVE BANDS IN THE US AND IN EUROPE BUT HAD NEVER RECORDED AN ALBUM OR A
trainval/LhszKevcH30/50004 WE ARE MUSIC ARCHIVISTS
trainval/LhszKevcH30/50005 WE ARE TASTEMAKERS AND CURATORS
trainval/Ligs82S0qN8/50001 THE STORIES WE TELL HAVE PROFOUND EFFECTS ON WHAT WE EXPECT FROM PEOPLE AND THEREFORE ON HOW WE INTERACT WITH THEM
trainval/Ligs82S0qN8/50002 WE WILL PROBABLY GIVE HER HANDOUTS WITHOUT SEEKING TO INVOLVE HER IN THE PROCESS
trainval/Ligs82S0qN8/50003 THE RATS LABELED AS BRIGHT SOLVED THE MAZE MUCH QUICKER THAN THE RATS LABELED AS DULL
trainval/Ligs82S0qN8/50004 YOU WOULDN'T GET IT ANYWAY
trainval/Ligs82S0qN8/50005 WHAT'S YOUR VISION FOR YOUR VILLAGE
trainval/Ligs82S0qN8/50006 MORE THAN AN ORGANIZATION PROJECT POTENTIAL IS A MIND SET
trainval/Ligs82S0qN8/50007 RECENTLY SOMEONE ASKED SUHANI WHAT'S YOUR VISION
trainval/Ligs82S0qN8/50008 AND WHAT DO YOU WANT YOUR LEGACY TO BE
trainval/Ligs82S0qN8/50009 IT'S TIME FOR US TO BEGIN IDENTIFYING CELEBRATING AND BUILDING ON THE STRENGTHS THAT PEOPLE
trainval/Ligs82S0qN8/50010 WE NEED TO FOCUS ON POTENTIAL IN PLACE OF PROBLEMS
trainval/Ligs82S0qN8/50011 CREATE SHARED OBJECTIVES INSTEAD OF OBSTACLES AND EMPOWER DREAMS INSTEAD OF FURTHERING
trainval/Ligs82S0qN8/50012 AND WHY NOT
trainval/LiyaSr5aeho/50001 THIS BRAIN SITS IN YOUR BODY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE BRAIN AND THE BODY
trainval/LiyaSr5aeho/50002 SO HOW DID MR
trainval/LiyaSr5aeho/50003 ROGERS HAD FOR ALL OF US AND TEACH NOT ONLY READING WRITING ARITHMETIC VERY IMPORTANT 3 RS
trainval/LiyaSr5aeho/50004 AND THAT'S THE BASIS OF THE EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE ACTUALLY AND IT'S THE BASIS AS YOU'LL SEE IN THE MOMENT OF SOCIAL
trainval/LiyaSr5aeho/50005 WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS HAND MODEL OF THE BRAIN AND I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU ALL HOW TO DO THIS
trainval/LiyaSr5aeho/50006 SO THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS WE NEED TO REALLY THINK DEEPLY ABOUT
trainval/LiyaSr5aeho/50007 THE BRAINSTEMS ARE ALSO GOING TO HAVE THE FIGHT FLIGHT FREEZE REACTION
trainval/LiyaSr5aeho/50008 SOME PEOPLE CALL THAT THE HEAD BRAIN SOME PEOPLE JUST CALL IT THE BRAIN BUT ACTUALLY YOU HAVE A BRAIN AROUND YOUR HEART
trainval/LiyaSr5aeho/50009 TO DEMONSTRATE HOW THIS WORKS UP LEWIS WHY DON'T YOU COME UP
trainval/LiyaSr5aeho/50010 THAT'S BASICALLY THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE MEAN BY THE NERVOUS SYSTEM
trainval/LiyaSr5aeho/50011 LET'S DO THE HAND MODEL
trainval/LiyaSr5aeho/50012 THERE'S ALL SORTS OF LAYERS TO IT AND IT MAKES MAPS TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD
trainval/LizFrxTK5Qo/50001 THIS IS HOW SCIENCE LEARNS
trainval/LizFrxTK5Qo/50002 HE CAN THEN WEAR A PROSTHETIC AND RUN AND JUMP AND PLAY
trainval/LizFrxTK5Qo/50003 BUT WE DIDN'T LEARN ABOUT IT FROM COMMON CANCERS
trainval/LizFrxTK5Qo/50004 I WRITE ABOUT THESE CONVERSATIONS
trainval/LizFrxTK5Qo/50005 THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE TERRIBLY FRAUGHT
trainval/LizFrxTK5Qo/50006 I'M GOING TO QUIT MY JOB
trainval/LizFrxTK5Qo/50007 I'M GOING TO MOVE IN WITH MY PARENTS
trainval/LizFrxTK5Qo/50008 BUT HIS CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PATIENT WERE EXACTLY WHAT A PATIENT MIGHT WANT
trainval/LizFrxTK5Qo/50009 BRIMMING WITH CONFIDENCE
trainval/LizFrxTK5Qo/50010 WHAT WILL YOU TELL THEM
trainval/lJGtXuCmZBM/50001 I FOUND MYSELF BECOMING A LITTLE BIT OF A TECHNOPHOBE
trainval/lJGtXuCmZBM/50002 AND WE WERE IN CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW NOTHING HAD CHANGED SINCE THE TIME OF THE ANCIENT INDIAN EPIC THE
trainval/lJGtXuCmZBM/50003 WE'RE HARNESSING ENERGY FROM THE SUN
trainval/LJhklPJz9U8/50001 ALL CACILDA AND I HAVE DONE IS EXTEND THIS SHARING BEHAVIOR TO SEXUALITY
trainval/LJhklPJz9U8/50002 YOU'VE KNOWN THESE PEOPLE YOUR ENTIRE LIFE
trainval/LJhklPJz9U8/50003 I'M NOT SAYING THAT THEY DIDN'T LOVE THE PEOPLE THEY WERE HAVING SEX WITH
trainval/LJhklPJz9U8/50004 AND I'M NOT SAYING THERE WAS NO PAIR BONDING GOING ON
trainval/LJhklPJz9U8/50005 SO THIS IS MY POINT
trainval/LJhklPJz9U8/50006 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLANET IN THE AMAZON WE'VE GOT MANY TRIBES WHICH PRACTICE WHAT
trainval/LJhklPJz9U8/50007 NONVIOLENCE IS A CHOICE LIKE VEGETARIANISM BUT IT'S NOT WHO YOU ARE
trainval/LJhklPJz9U8/50008 BUT THAT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE
trainval/LJhklPJz9U8/50009 WE HAVE APPETITES
trainval/ljqra3BcqWM/50001 WE HAD FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIERS WE HAD US ARMY SOLDIERS AND US MARINES ALONG
trainval/ljqra3BcqWM/50002 AND THAT PERSON WAS ME
trainval/LkOmfSSQLgI/50001 I ENJOYED WORKING IN AN OPEN AND DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT BASED
trainval/LkOmfSSQLgI/50002 SO REFUGEES CAN BE POTENTIAL PARTNERS AND RESOURCES OF ECONOMIC CHANGE
trainval/LkOmfSSQLgI/50003 YES I AGREE
trainval/LkOmfSSQLgI/50004 BECAUSE WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER REFUGEES AND LOCAL CITIZENS ADDING UP
trainval/LkOmfSSQLgI/50005 TRY TO ASK HIM WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO HERE
trainval/lkVYV2P8dQE/50002 IT SLOWS THE HEART BEAT DOWN
trainval/lkVYV2P8dQE/50003 MY MAMA NEVER WHISPERED THE SHAME OF POVERTY IN OUR EARS
trainval/lkVYV2P8dQE/50004 SHE TAUGHT US TO DANCE TO OUR OWN SHADOWS
trainval/lkVYV2P8dQE/50005 WE GO DOWN DARK ALLEYS THEY GO DEEPER INTO THE SHADOWS FURTHER THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN BUT
trainval/lkzoQuzlW4M/50001 HOW WELL DO WE MAKE DECISIONS
trainval/lkzoQuzlW4M/50002 BECAUSE IF IT SENDS AN IMAGE TO THE EARTH IT TAKES ABOUT 12 MINUTES ON
trainval/lkzoQuzlW4M/50003 SO IT WOULD BE TOO LATE
trainval/lkzoQuzlW4M/50004 I THINK EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM WAS A CHILD AT SOME POINT
trainval/lkzoQuzlW4M/50005 AND THIS IS TRUE FOR EMPLOYEE EMPLOYER RELATIONSHIP AS WELL
trainval/lkzoQuzlW4M/50006 WHERE WOULD YOU GO
trainval/lkzoQuzlW4M/50008 WHERE YOU HAVE TO COMPARE THE BENEFITS AND COSTS OF DIFFERENT CITIES NOW YOU HAVE TO COMPARE THE REPUTATIONS OF
trainval/llhT0BtSst0/50001 WE'RE NOW OVER 22 IN COLORADO
trainval/llhT0BtSst0/50002 IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS BUILT INTO THE SCHOOL GROUND
trainval/llhT0BtSst0/50003 IT'S PART OF THE PLAYGROUND
trainval/LlJJRGPfqwA/50001 DEAR MIND SORRY FOR THINKING TOO MUCH
trainval/LlJJRGPfqwA/50002 TIME DOESN'T HEAL ANYTHING
trainval/LLmhQmicusM/50001 IT'S SO WONDERFUL TO BE HERE
trainval/LLmhQmicusM/50002 WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES US HUMAN
trainval/LLmhQmicusM/50003 I MARRIED A NEANDERTHAL
trainval/LLmhQmicusM/50004 HE MOVED TO MOSCOW AND BASICALLY TOOK CARE OF DIMITRI SINCE HE WAS IN THE SECOND GRADE ABOUT EIGHT
trainval/LLmhQmicusM/50005 WELL HOW DID THEY GET THIS WAY
trainval/LLmhQmicusM/50006 WHY WOULD YOU WANT THEM TO HAVE SPLOTCHY COATS
trainval/LLmhQmicusM/50007 AND SO DIMITRI THEN DECIDED TO DO WHAT NOBODY ELSE HAS DONE BEFORE OR SINCE AND HE WAS GOING TO
trainval/LLmhQmicusM/50008 HE HAD THIS OVEN MITT BECAUSE THESE FOXES WERE ESSENTIALLY WILD THEY WOULD BITE IF YOU TRIED TO HOLD THEM SO HE HAD THIS
trainval/LLmhQmicusM/50009 I WENT TO THIS TALK BY STEVE CHURCHILL WHO IS THE WORLD'S EXPERT ON NEANDERTHALS AND HE PUTS
trainval/LLmhQmicusM/50010 THIS IS SERIOUSLY IMPRESSIVE BECAUSE IN ORDER TO DO THIS YOUR DOG HAS TO UNDERSTAND THAT
trainval/LLmhQmicusM/50011 SO IT TURNS OUT THAT THESE FOXES THAT DIMITRI HAD DOMESTICATED THEY ALSO
trainval/LLmhQmicusM/50012 AND IF I REPHRASE THAT GAME TO YOU AND IF THERE WAS SOMEBODY IF YOU HAD THE CHOICE TO SHARE THE 100 WITH A
trainval/LLmhQmicusM/50014 SO WE GAVE THEM THIS COOPERATIVE GAME WHERE YOU HAVE TO COOPERATE WITH ANOTHER
trainval/LLmhQmicusM/50015 AND IT TURNS OUT THAT BONOBOS ARE BETTER THAN CHIMPANZEES AT THIS
trainval/LLmhQmicusM/50016 SO ECONOMIC THEORY PREDICTS THAT WE'RE JUST GOING TO KEEP ALL THE MONEY BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHY WOULD YOU GIVE ANY OF IT AWAY
trainval/LLmhQmicusM/50017 AND YOU KNOW SHE TOOK IT LIKE A CHAMP
trainval/LLmhQmicusM/50018 IT WAS NOT THE MOST GENIUS IDEA BUT ALL I COULD COME UP WITH I WAS SO SLEEP DEPRIVED
trainval/LLmhQmicusM/50021 IS SHE GOING OUTSIDE
trainval/LLmhQmicusM/50022 I MEAN WHEN WE ARRIVED IN EUROPE WE WIPED OUT ALMOST ALL OF THEM EXCEPT FOR WOLVES
trainval/LLmhQmicusM/50023 SO IF WOLVES WERE AGGRESSIVE TOWARDS PEOPLE AND THEY WERE LARGER THAN THEY ARE TODAY WE JUST WOULD HAVE KILLED THEM
trainval/LLmhQmicusM/50024 SO ONLY THE SUPER FRIENDLY WOLVES WOULD HAVE SURVIVED
trainval/LLmhQmicusM/50025 WE HAD THIS EXPLOSION OF TECHNOLOGY
trainval/LlQXs0yofMs/50001 NOT ONE SINGLE STUDY
trainval/LlQXs0yofMs/50002 NOW IT'S AS OUTDATED AS THE MAP THAT CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS REJECTED WHEN HE SET SAIL FOR THE
trainval/LlQXs0yofMs/50003 LET ME EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT
trainval/LlQXs0yofMs/50004 YOU DRINK THE WHOLE BOTTLE YOU'LL PROBABLY FALL OVER
trainval/LlQXs0yofMs/50005 LOW AMOUNTS LOW DOSES OF TOXIC CHEMICALS HAVE THE ABILITY TO INTERFERE WITH THE HUMAN BODY HAVE THE ABILITY
trainval/LlQXs0yofMs/50006 THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD AT LEAST A DEFINITION
trainval/LM3ISST2eg8/50001 THE SPELLING RULES ARE RELAXED
trainval/LM3ISST2eg8/50002 GRAMMAR RULES ARE RELAXED
trainval/LM3ISST2eg8/50003 YOU CAN SHORTEN WORDS
trainval/LM3ISST2eg8/50004 SPELL THEM PHONETICALLY
trainval/LM3ISST2eg8/50005 LOUIS UNIVERSITY IN THE U
trainval/LM3ISST2eg8/50006 I WORKED WITH PROFESSOR KEVIN SCANNELL
trainval/LM3ISST2eg8/50007 WE WANTED TO FIND OUT JUST HOW IRISH IS BEING USED ONLINE
trainval/LM3ISST2eg8/50008 WELL WE TOOK LANGUAGE PROCESSING TOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN DESIGNED FOR USE WITH GRAMMATICAL WELL STRUCTURED IRISH
trainval/LM3ISST2eg8/50009 WHAT CHALLENGES WOULD ARISE
trainval/LM3ISST2eg8/50010 AND WHAT WE'VE FOUND IS IRISH IS BEHAVING JUST LIKE ANY OTHER LANGUAGE ONLINE AND ANY OTHER LANGUAGE
trainval/LM3ISST2eg8/50011 IT'S A VERSION OF IRISH THAT'S MORE ACCESSIBLE TO A BROADER RANGE OF SPEAKERS AND IN PARTICULAR TO
trainval/LM3ISST2eg8/50012 AND YOU START TO ENGAGE WITH THE OTHER LINGUISTIC COMMUNITY SPEAKERS
trainval/LmPBNaO1c58/50001 BUT GUESS WHAT
trainval/LMrzdkSYnYY/50001 WE OWN OUR MINDS
trainval/LMrzdkSYnYY/50002 SO FROM THE RETINA YOU GO ONTO VISUAL CORTEX
trainval/LMrzdkSYnYY/50003 THAT'S WHERE THE DIFFERENCE IS
trainval/LMrzdkSYnYY/50004 ONLY THE WEALTH OF OUR MINDS IS NOT THE VERY FACT THAT WE HAVE A SELF THAT WE CAN
trainval/LMrzdkSYnYY/50005 THE AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SELF IS BUILT ON THE BASIS OF PAST MEMORIES AND MEMORIES OF THE
trainval/LNHBMFCzznE/50001 REMEMBER THAT LONG TERM MEMORIES TAKE TIME
trainval/LNHBMFCzznE/50002 YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE EVEN GOING TO VARY WITHIN INDIVIDUALS
trainval/lnigGtrwAfs/50001 SO WHAT DO WE DO
trainval/lnigGtrwAfs/50002 SO YOU GO TO THE GYM YOU WORK OUT
trainval/lnigGtrwAfs/50003 THAT WORKOUT ALWAYS FEELS GOOD
trainval/lnigGtrwAfs/50004 ARE YOU GOING TO SPRING OUT OF BED
trainval/lnigGtrwAfs/50005 SO WHAT IS THE SECRET
trainval/LnnyuVG0krs/50001 SO ONCE WE'VE FIGURED OUT HOW TO EARN MONEY MANY OF US STRUGGLE HOW TO KEEP IT AND MY EXPERIENCE
trainval/LnnyuVG0krs/50002 THAT EXPERIENCE HAS STUCK WITH ME FOREVER
trainval/LnnyuVG0krs/50003 BUT HOW MANY OF US GOT ANY FINANCIAL EDUCATION AT SCHOOL
trainval/LnnyuVG0krs/50004 THAT'S PROBABLY SOME OF US IN THIS ROOM
trainval/LnnyuVG0krs/50005 BECAUSE THAT'S THE FIRST LESSON
trainval/LnnyuVG0krs/50006 AND YET I PROMISE YOU HE LEARNT THE MOST VALUABLE LESSON THAT DAY
trainval/LnnyuVG0krs/50007 LET'S START FINDING FUN AND ENGAGING WAYS TO ALLOW OUR CHILDREN TO EXPERIENCE
trainval/LnnyuVG0krs/50008 BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT I WAS VERY LUCKY GROWING UP IN ARGENTINA BECAUSE I GOT TO EXPERIENCE THINGS THAT MOST PEOPLE
trainval/LNohxpJntZo/50001 THEY'VE BEEN THERE FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS
trainval/LNohxpJntZo/50002 THEY GET ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH THE PROCESS
trainval/LNohxpJntZo/50003 AND THEN DUE TO THE CONTINGENCIES OF A SUBSISTENCE LIFE THEY ARE FORCED TO LEAVE
trainval/LNohxpJntZo/50004 THAT'S A TERRIBLE OUTCOME FOR TWO REASONS
trainval/LNohxpJntZo/50005 STUDENT RYAN SCHMIDT
trainval/LNohxpJntZo/50007 THAT'S ABOUT OUR TIMELINE
trainval/LNohxpJntZo/50008 THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT REMAIN
trainval/LNohxpJntZo/50009 AND POTENTIALLY CHANGING THE MATERIAL GEOMETRY OF THIS OBJECT IN ORDER TO INCREASE ITS STRENGTH
trainval/LNohxpJntZo/50010 AND IN FACT OUR PROJECT KIND OF FITS WITHIN SOME OF THAT LOGIC IS WELL THE IDEA OF USING THIS EMERGING
trainval/LNohxpJntZo/50011 NOW I COINED A TERM IN 2007 CALLED CRITICAL MAKING AND I'VE BEEN STUDYING
trainval/LnQYJa9SaR0/50001 SO OF COURSE PEOPLE LIKE TO GO TO LOCAL SHOPS BUT YOU'D BE PREPARED TO GO A LITTLE BIT FURTHER IF IT WAS A
trainval/lnvkNGc6YYM/50001 NONE OF IT WAS PROCESSED
trainval/lnvkNGc6YYM/50002 NONE OF IT WAS MANUFACTURED
trainval/lnvkNGc6YYM/50003 AND THE MOST DETRIMENTAL ELEMENT OF THAT UNREAL FOOD THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY IS SUGAR
trainval/lnvkNGc6YYM/50004 IT'S NOT JUST CANDY AND SWEETS AND SODAS
trainval/lnvkNGc6YYM/50005 IT'S SAVORY THINGS IT'S UNEXPECTED ITEMS IT'S DRESSINGS IT'S BREAD PRODUCTS IT'S DAIRY PRODUCTS
trainval/lnvkNGc6YYM/50006 WE NEED TO STOP EATING SO MUCH PROCESSED FOOD AND SUGAR
trainval/lO1P6lCNnyo/50001 WHAT I'M REFERRING TO IS PREPARING STUDENTS FOR THE CULTURE OF COLLEGE THOSE SPOKEN AND UNSPOKEN RULES
trainval/lO1P6lCNnyo/50002 AND I KNOW A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT THIS
trainval/lO1P6lCNnyo/50003 MY PARENTS WERE BOTH HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUTS AND TEEN PARENTS
trainval/lO1P6lCNnyo/50004 I HAD TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING
trainval/lO1P6lCNnyo/50005 I DIDN'T KNOW
trainval/lO1P6lCNnyo/50006 I HAD NO IDEA THAT THERE WAS A SEQUENCE OF CLASSES YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO TAKE IN ORDER TO GET YOUR DEGREE
trainval/lO1P6lCNnyo/50007 PERHAPS THE MOST HUMOROUS EXAMPLE I CAN SHARE WITH YOU WAS THIS SPECIAL TOPICS COURSE I TOOK TITLED
trainval/lO1P6lCNnyo/50008 SO I SPENT A SEMESTER ANALYZING HORROR FILMS FROM START TO END
trainval/lO1P6lCNnyo/50009 AMONG THE CHALLENGES THAT PROBABLY INSTANTLY COME TO MIND WOULD BE ACADEMIC CHALLENGES
trainval/lO1P6lCNnyo/50010 SO WHAT DO WE DO
trainval/lO1P6lCNnyo/50011 HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN
trainval/lO1P6lCNnyo/50012 WELL I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE DO
trainval/lO1P6lCNnyo/50013 AMONG THE THINGS THAT WE DO IS WE TAKE STUDENTS ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES SO THAT WE BRING COLLEGE TO LIFE FOR
trainval/lO1P6lCNnyo/50014 WE ALSO PAID FOR THIS EXPERIENCE
trainval/lO1P6lCNnyo/50015 AND THIS SHOULD COME TO MIND BECAUSE WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT 51 OF NEW MEXICO HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES UPON
trainval/lO1P6lCNnyo/50016 WE VISIT LECTURE HALLS AND DORM ROOMS AND DINING SERVICES AND WE EXPOSE STUDENTS TO ALL THE SERVICES THAT
trainval/lO1P6lCNnyo/50017 WE TEACH THEM THE QUESTIONS TO ASK
trainval/lO1P6lCNnyo/50018 ADDITIONALLY WE MANDATE THAT STUDENTS TAKE DUAL ENROLLMENT COURSES SO THAT THEY EARN HIGH SCHOOL CREDIT WHILE
trainval/lO1P6lCNnyo/50019 BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THEIR SUCCESS SHOULD BE HINGED ON LUCK
trainval/lO1P6lCNnyo/50020 IN 2014 A STUDY PRESENTED TO THE NEW MEXICO LEGISLATIVE FINANCE COMMITTEE INDICATED THAT WHEN
trainval/LoXAAEy6YQU/50001 NOW AM I SAYING OH WELL GREAT PREVENTION STRATEGY
trainval/Lp5Ccer5NM8/50001 WHY AM I STILL AND OCEAN OPTIMIST
trainval/Lp5Ccer5NM8/50002 BUT THE PROBLEM IS THESE TRADES HAVE MEANT THAT SEAHORSES HAVE BECOME A
trainval/Lp5Ccer5NM8/50003 THERE WASN'T EVEN A DEGREE ON THE TOPIC WHEN I WAS IN UNIVERSITY AND NOW THERE ARE MANY BUT IT'S STILL A TINY BUSINESS
trainval/Lp5Ccer5NM8/50004 THEY'RE QUITE EXTRAORDINARY
trainval/Lp5Ccer5NM8/50005 WE HAVE THE LARGEST LIVING CORAL ATOLL IN THE WORLD
trainval/Lp5Ccer5NM8/50006 PEOPLE CAN MAKE THAT INDIVIDUAL CHOICE TO USE A REFILLABLE BOTTLE INSTEAD
trainval/Lp5Ccer5NM8/50007 THIS JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT THERE IS NO FORMULA TO BEING A CONSERVATIONIST
trainval/Lp5Ccer5NM8/50008 SWITCH TO A REFILLABLE BOTTLE
trainval/lPmBmFBwdec/50001 HONESTLY IT FEELS COUNTER TO MOST OF THE INSTINCTS THAT YOU HAVE
trainval/lPmBmFBwdec/50002 SO I WANTED TO PUT FORWARD THREE SIMPLE THINGS THAT MIGHT HELP AS YOU TAKE YOUR OWN JOURNEY OUTSIDE OF YOUR
trainval/LpNkuaVnlPY/50001 AND I REFUSED TO PLAY EVEN THAT UNLESS I GOT TO BE THE DOCTOR
trainval/LpNkuaVnlPY/50002 WHY COULD MY HOME BE A MUSEUM
trainval/LpNkuaVnlPY/50003 I NEVER THOUGHT AGAIN ABOUT THE MATTER
trainval/LPrS7Skx9Y0/50001 AND I SAID I'VE GOT POWERPOINT
trainval/LPrS7Skx9Y0/50002 I USED TO BE A SUMMER CAMP COUNSELOR
trainval/LPrS7Skx9Y0/50003 I WOULD DO IT ON MY SUMMERS OFF FROM COLLEGE AND I LOVED IT
trainval/LPrS7Skx9Y0/50004 I WAS IN CHARGE OF THE FOUR YEAR OLDS WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE FOUR YEAR OLDS CAN'T PLAY SPORTS AND
trainval/LPrS7Skx9Y0/50005 I WOULD TELL THEM ABOUT HOW ON THE WEEKENDS I WOULD GO HOME AND I WOULD SPY FOR THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND
trainval/LPrS7Skx9Y0/50006 AND SHE WAS LIKE WHY
trainval/LPrS7Skx9Y0/50007 ADULTS CAN TOO AND WE GET THERE WHEN WE READ
trainval/LPrS7Skx9Y0/50008 IT WAS GOING TO BE THE HIGHLIGHT OF OUR STORE
trainval/LPrS7Skx9Y0/50009 IT'S ALMOST AS OLD AS STORYTELLING ITSELF
trainval/LPrS7Skx9Y0/50010 AND HERE'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE
trainval/LPrS7Skx9Y0/50011 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/lPtPG2lAmm4/50001 TO MEASURE THE FIRST ONE WE ASKED THEM ABOUT INNOVATION REVENUE
trainval/lPtPG2lAmm4/50002 IT WAS SOMETHING AN OLDER GENERATION HAD TO FIGHT FOR
trainval/lPtPG2lAmm4/50003 WHICH WAY IS IT
trainval/lPtPG2lAmm4/50004 WE GOT QUITE SOME ATTENTION
trainval/lPtPG2lAmm4/50005 BUT IT'S DOABLE AND THERE ARE MANY COMPANIES TODAY THAT ARE MAKING PROGRESS THERE AND DOING IT SUCCESSFULLY
trainval/lPtPG2lAmm4/50006 LET'S TAKE SAP THE SOFTWARE COMPANY AS AN EXAMPLE
trainval/lPtPG2lAmm4/50007 AND BY EMBRACING DIVERSITY BY EMBRACING DIVERSE TALENT WE ARE PROVIDING TRUE OPPORTUNITY FOR
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50001 NOW AS MENTIONED I DID ATTEND PENN STATE
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50002 SO THAT'S WHAT I DID
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50003 AND THE THING ABOUT IT IS I WAS PURSUING A DREAM
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50004 HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE EVER AUDITIONED FOR SOMETHING
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50005 BUT IN NEW YORK CITY AUDITIONING IS A LIFESTYLE AUDITIONING IS A FULL TIME JOB
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50006 A CASTING TEAM IS THE UNSUNG HERO OF A LOT OF THEATRICAL PRODUCTIONS
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50007 THEY PUT THE CAST TOGETHER AND THE UNITS THAT YOU SEE WHICH CHANGE YOU AFTER THE TWO AND A HALF HOURS
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50008 SO THEY'RE VERY PARTICULAR AND THEY'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR CERTAIN THINGS DEPENDING ON THE SHOW OR WHATEVER IT IS
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50009 I BRUSHED MY TEETH I TOOK A SHOWER
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50010 I HOPPED ON A SUBWAY IN ASTORIA
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50011 I WENT INTO MIDTOWN MANHATTAN
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50012 I STOOD OUTSIDE FOR AN HOUR WHICH WAS AWESOME
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50013 I STOOD INSIDE FOR AN HOUR WHICH WAS AWESOME
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50014 AND THEN I WAITED
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50015 AND SO I COULDN'T WAIT
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50016 I WAS REVVING AND READY TO GO
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50017 MAYBE THEY'RE LOOKING TO SEE MORE PEOPLE WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50018 AND THIS IS MY FAVORITE PART
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50019 I DON'T KNOW WHY THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50020 SO THE CASTING TEAM DEFINITELY HAD TO KNOCK DOWN THE MUSIC ON THIS ONE
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50021 WE WILL HAVE EXPERIENCED SOMETHING TOGETHER AND WE'LL NEVER BE THE SAME
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50022 OH YOU KNOW I JUST SAID IT
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50023 TAKE A LOOK
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50025 I KNOW IT'S WEIRD
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50026 I WAS BORN WITH IT
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50027 SO I GO ONTO MY LAST AUDITION OF THE DAY
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50028 NOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE THIS POINT OR AFTER
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50029 IT WAS THE WEIRDEST EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD IN AN AUDITION
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50030 BUT I KIND OF LOVED IT
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50031 TO THE TABLE IS GOOD ENOUGH OR NOT
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50033 I DON'T KNOW
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50034 AND THAT'S ANOTHER PART THAT YOU THAT DEAL WITH
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50035 I EAT MY DINNER AND I WAIT
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50036 BUT I SHOWED UP AND THERE JUST SEEMED TO BE A TREND
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50037 WE WERE ALL WAITING IN LINE ME AND BUNCH OF OTHER GUYS
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50038 AND WE WERE JUST WAITING
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50039 SO I TRIED TO THINK HOW CAN I TELL THESE PEOPLE WHO I AM
trainval/LPwWYFOFTGU/50040 HOW CAN THEY REMEMBER ME IN ANY WAY
trainval/lqbLSUhhyPk/50001 6 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE UK THAT SUFFER WITH EATING DISORDERS
trainval/lqbLSUhhyPk/50002 A LOT OF PEOPLE DO NOT REALISE THAT THEY ARE SUFFERING AND THAT WAS EXACTLY THE SAME FOR ME
trainval/lqbLSUhhyPk/50003 IT WAS A DIFFICULT SHOW TO WRITE
trainval/lqbLSUhhyPk/50004 THEN WE WOULD HAVE FREAK SHOWS NOW WE HAVE REALITY TV
trainval/lqbLSUhhyPk/50005 I WILL NEVER FORGET THE FIRST TIME THAT I EVER TRIED THIS IN A SHOW
trainval/lqbLSUhhyPk/50006 SO I DECIDED TO START TELLING MY STORY
trainval/lqbLSUhhyPk/50008 I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT SO THAT WE CAN HELP SUFFERERS
trainval/lqbLSUhhyPk/50009 BUT YOU ARE A VERY WEAK PERSON
trainval/lqbLSUhhyPk/50010 THEY WENT AND SOUGHT HELP IN THE CHURCH THEY TRIED TO DRAG ME ALONG
trainval/lqbLSUhhyPk/50011 I WAS GOING NOWHERE NEAR THAT PLACE
trainval/lqbLSUhhyPk/50013 TALK ABOUT EMPTY CALORIES
trainval/lqbLSUhhyPk/50014 WHY ARE YOU HERE
trainval/lQDxasFKQCA/50001 FIVE YEARS DOWN THE TRACK SHE IS STILL HERE WITH US GOING STRONG
trainval/lQDxasFKQCA/50002 SO SHE IS MY DAILY REMINDER OF WHY I DO WHAT I DO AT VETS BEYOND BORDERS WHICH IS ABOUT PROVIDING BASIC
trainval/lQDxasFKQCA/50003 THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE
trainval/lQDxasFKQCA/50006 AND MANY THANKS TO FOUNDATION BRIGITTE BARDOT THEY FUNDED THIS PROGRAM IN 2005 WHEN WE STARTED
trainval/lQDxasFKQCA/50007 IT'S BEEN SIX YEARS NOW TWO YEARS AFTER WE STARTED WE HAVEN'T HAD A SINGLE CASE OF HUMAN RABIES REPORTED IN
trainval/lQDxasFKQCA/50008 SO IT DOES WORK
trainval/lQDxasFKQCA/50009 TO GET THE DOGS FOR THIS PROGRAM WE HAD TO TRAVEL A COUPLE OF HOURS AWAY TO A NEIGHBORING VILLAGE
trainval/lQDxasFKQCA/50010 WHAT MADE HER STAND OUT TO ME WAS THAT WHEN I WAS AT THE KENNELS I WAS WALKING AROUND LOOKING AT THE DOGS
trainval/lQDxasFKQCA/50011 IT'S THE SAME DEAL BRINGING THE DOGS BACK
trainval/lQDxasFKQCA/50012 IT'S COMPLETELY DETRIMENTAL TO THE WHOLE PROJECT
trainval/lQDxasFKQCA/50013 SO THEY CAN RECOGNIZE THAT
trainval/lQDxasFKQCA/50014 SO THROUGH CATCHING THESE DOGS KINDLY AND BRINGING THEM BACK IN BETTER HEALTH THAN BEFORE ONLY THEN CAN WE GET
trainval/lQDxasFKQCA/50015 WE'RE JUST AT THE BEGINNING
trainval/lQflBowgVB4/50001 AND HE HAD BEEN LEFT WITH A COMMISSION TO PAINT 12 APOSTLES AGAINST A DECORATIVE BACKGROUND IN THE SISTINE CHAPEL
trainval/lQflBowgVB4/50002 BUT GENIUS ROSE TO THE CHALLENGE
trainval/lQflBowgVB4/50003 HE FOCUSED ON THE ACT OF CREATION
trainval/lQflBowgVB4/50004 CHOIRS OF ANGELS
trainval/lQflBowgVB4/50005 BECAUSE I REALIZED THAT THIS REPRESENTATION OF THE HUMAN DRAMA WAS ALWAYS ABOUT MEN AND
trainval/lQflBowgVB4/50006 THE PRINTING PRESS MADE SURE THAT EVERYBODY SAW IT
trainval/lQflBowgVB4/50007 THAT'S WHERE IT ALL CAME ABOUT AND IT CAME ABOUT FROM A CHURCH THAT WAS TRYING TO SAVE A WORK OF ART
trainval/lqSBVyou38s/50001 JUST KNOWING MY ROOMMATES WERE IN THE SAME HOUSE MADE ME UNCOMFORTABLE
trainval/lqSBVyou38s/50002 BUT AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS JUST WRITING SONGS WASN'T ENOUGH
trainval/lRAeIrv4TEE/50001 MEANTIME I AM THIS ADOLESCENT PRETEEN TRYING TO FIND MY WAY HERE
trainval/lRAeIrv4TEE/50002 AT THE CAR PARTIES MY PARENTS HAD OR WHEN RELATIVES HAD BARBECUES IF AN AL GREEN SONG A MARVIN GAYE SONG
trainval/lRAeIrv4TEE/50003 THERE'S A CALL AND RESPONSE TO MUSIC
trainval/lRAeIrv4TEE/50004 IT WAS MUCH LATER WHEN I STARTED TO STUDY IT FORMALLY THAT I UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD WHEN
trainval/lRAeIrv4TEE/50005 GOSPEL IS ABOUT A COMMUNAL SHARING OF AN EXPERIENCE
trainval/lRAeIrv4TEE/50006 WHETHER IT'S SECULARIZED OR A SPIRITUAL ONE
trainval/lRAeIrv4TEE/50007 THERE'S A LOT OF BRUTALITY GOING ON BUT THERE'S STILL THIS MUSIC
trainval/lRAeIrv4TEE/50009 THEY WEREN'T TALKING ABOUT A QUEER LITTLE BLACK BOY IN LITTLE ROCK ARKANSAS
trainval/lRAeIrv4TEE/50010 BUT I WAS ABLE TO TAKE THIS MUSIC SOMEHOW WHICH HAD BEEN A GIFT FROM MY FATHER I DON'T THINK HE KNEW IT WAS A GIFT
trainval/lRAeIrv4TEE/50011 I FALL IN LOVE WITH MY BEST FRIEND
trainval/lRAeIrv4TEE/50012 HOW CAN I NOW CALL MY MOMMA A BITCH AND THINK OF HER AS ANYTHING LESS THAN THE POWERFUL WOMAN SHE WAS WHO MADE HER
trainval/lRAeIrv4TEE/50013 AND WHERE'S THIS ANGST COMING FROM
trainval/lRAeIrv4TEE/50014 SO WHY IS THIS MUSIC NOT SPEAKING TO MY CONDITION
trainval/LrBKcTTMlCQ/50002 THEN THEY ATTACKED GAY PEOPLE
trainval/LrBKcTTMlCQ/50003 DON'T SHY AWAY FROM PHRASES LIKE MORAL OBLIGATION
trainval/Lrdn4lazVBc/50001 SO I KNEW SOMETHING WAS MISSING INSIDE OF ME
trainval/Lrdn4lazVBc/50002 YOU THINK ANYONE ANYTIME ANYWHERE CAN TELL YOU WHAT YOU CAN AND CANNOT DO IN YOUR BODY
trainval/Lrdn4lazVBc/50003 IT WAS A CELEBRATION OF THE FEMININE BODY
trainval/Lrdn4lazVBc/50004 I RECLAIMED MY BODY AFTER A LIFETIME OF SELF CRITICISM BROUGHT ON BY A
trainval/Lrdn4lazVBc/50005 WHEN SHE GETS STRONGER HE GETS STRONGER
trainval/LRTTPsSAujA/50001 HOW DO YOU DO THAT
trainval/lrYx7HaUlMY/50001 WHEN I GOT TO CHARLOTTE SHE CALLED ME
trainval/lrYx7HaUlMY/50002 YOU WERE AS WHITE AS A SHEET
trainval/lrYx7HaUlMY/50003 SO I CAN GO ON VACATION OR I CAN GET MY HAIR CUT
trainval/lrYx7HaUlMY/50004 I THINK WHAT'S THAT ABOUT
trainval/lrYx7HaUlMY/50005 THAT IS MY SEAT
trainval/lrYx7HaUlMY/50006 I SAID YEAH MY ROTOR IS NOT BENT
trainval/lrYx7HaUlMY/50007 HE SAID I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT
trainval/lrYx7HaUlMY/50008 EITHER THAT OR I'M AS SMART AS I EVER WAS IT'S JUST NOW I'M CONSTANTLY BEING
trainval/lrZZoCmSnME/50001 A METALLIC TOILET AGAINST THE BACK RIGHT ONE OF THOSE MATTRESSES YOU PRACTICE SIT UPS ON
trainval/LS6TWtYWaPA/50001 WHO IN AMERICA IS BUYING IT
trainval/LS6TWtYWaPA/50002 THE GENERAL U
trainval/LS6TWtYWaPA/50003 ABOUT 20 PEOPLE OF COLOR 15 HISPANIC AND ABOUT SIX OUT OF TEN SHOP AT WALMART
trainval/LS6TWtYWaPA/50004 FEED THE WORLD
trainval/LS6TWtYWaPA/50005 IT MUST BE BECAUSE ORGANIC FARMING IS MORE EXPENSIVE RIGHT
trainval/LS6TWtYWaPA/50006 WELL SO MAYBE ORGANIC FARMING SAVES MONEY BUT PERHAPS IT PRODUCES LESS FOOD
trainval/LS6TWtYWaPA/50007 THIS IS NOT A BLANKET STATEMENT IT VARIES BY CROP AND REGION BUT THERE ARE LOT OF WAYS IN WHICH WHEN DONE RIGHT
trainval/LS6TWtYWaPA/50008 YOU MUST BE THINKING
trainval/LS6TWtYWaPA/50009 WELL GREAT BUT INDUSTRIAL AGRICULTURE FOR ALL OF ITS ILLS SURELY AT LEAST THE ONE THING IT HAS IS THAT IT'S MORE EFFICIENT
trainval/LS6TWtYWaPA/50010 FOR EXAMPLE THINK ABOUT THE TOPSOIL
trainval/LS6TWtYWaPA/50011 INSTEAD WE'RE MINING MINERALS IN MORROCO SHIPPING THEM ACROSS THE ATLANTIC SPRAYING THEM ON THE FIELDS ONLY TO
trainval/LS6TWtYWaPA/50012 THAT'S NOT EFFICIENT IT'S INCREDIBLY WASTEFUL
trainval/LS6TWtYWaPA/50013 WE'RE NOT EVEN AVERAGE
trainval/LS6TWtYWaPA/50014 THE LEADING EXPORTER OF PORK IN THE WORLD TODAY IS DENMARK
trainval/LS6TWtYWaPA/50015 THIS IS AN APPROXIMATION THIS IS NOT VERY EXACT MATH
trainval/LS6TWtYWaPA/50016 DENMARK IS A COUNTRY THAT HAS FOR MANY YEARS BANNED THE USE OF SUB THERAPEUTIC ANTIBIOTICS IN LIVESTOCK
trainval/LS6TWtYWaPA/50017 FOR ONE THING CHIPOTLE WHICH IS THE CLOSEST WE HAVE TO A FAST FOOD ORGANIC COMPANY IS THE SINGLE FASTEST
trainval/LS6TWtYWaPA/50018 THAT'S HOW MUCH HAS ACTUALLY BEEN CONSUMED
trainval/LS6TWtYWaPA/50019 IT'S BEING IMPORTED
trainval/LS6TWtYWaPA/50020 I PUT MY OWN MONEY WHERE MY MOUTH IS AND I'VE INVESTED A LOT OF MONEY IN FARMLAND LP AS I MENTIONED WHICH IS CONVERTING
trainval/LS6TWtYWaPA/50021 WHAT'S THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO PRODUCE FOOD IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO EAT MORE MEAT
trainval/LSdPxGLesE4/50001 SO ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE THOUGHT WE WOULD TACKLE WOULD BE HOW WE GO ABOUT PREDICTING EPIDEMICS
trainval/LSdPxGLesE4/50002 WE TOOK 1300 RANDOMLY SELECTED UNDERGRADUATES WE HAD THEM NOMINATE THEIR FRIENDS AND WE FOLLOWED BOTH THE RANDOM
trainval/LSdPxGLesE4/50003 SO IF WE HAVE A POPULATION OF A THOUSAND PEOPLE AND WE WANT TO MAKE THE POPULATION IMMUNE TO A PATHOGEN WE DON'T HAVE TO
trainval/LSdPxGLesE4/50004 WOULD YOU GET ANY POPULATION LEVEL IMMUNITY
trainval/LSdPxGLesE4/50005 BUT IF YOU TOOK THIS 30 PERCENT THESE 300 PEOPLE AND HAD THEM NOMINATE THEIR FRIENDS AND TOOK THE SAME NUMBER OF
trainval/LsESSyMnwmU/50001 A SONNET IS A 14 LINE POEM AND SHAKESPEARE WROTE OVER
trainval/LsESSyMnwmU/50002 AND OF COURSE HE HAS TO GO
trainval/LSGfqyhleUA/50001 WHAT WAS THE EXPERIENCE I WAS TRYING TO DESCRIBE
trainval/LSGfqyhleUA/50002 I LOVE PEOPLE
trainval/LSGfqyhleUA/50003 SO IF I WOULD DESCRIBE IT NOW I MIGHT SAY SOMETHING LIKE YOU KNOW MY FRIEND WHEN YOU'RE LAUGHING NOW I'M FEELING A BIT UNSURE BECAUSE I REALLY WOULD
trainval/LSGfqyhleUA/50004 SO I WAS IN THE PARTY AND SUDDENLY I HAD A BRILLIANT IDEA
trainval/LSGfqyhleUA/50005 AND I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY MY FRIENDS WERE QUITE RELUCTANT TO PLAY THIS GAME
trainval/LSGfqyhleUA/50006 YOU SAY THE BOOK IS INTERESTING AND I SAY NO THE BOOK IS BORING
trainval/LSGfqyhleUA/50007 AM I BORING
trainval/LSGfqyhleUA/50008 OH MY GOD LIKE MY MOM SHE'S SO ANNOYING
trainval/LSGfqyhleUA/50009 AND BY THE WAY SAY YES ONLY IF YOU REALLY ENJOY TO DO THAT
trainval/lSiQSNSwgMM/50001 I LOVE THAT STORY
trainval/LSn4OF7G9BM/50001 I'M NOT ADVOCATING FOR TEENAGERS TO HAVE SEX
trainval/lSYy6poJ2zs/50001 TO EVERY SINGLE EVENT THAT THE VERY GOOD FRIEND WILL DO
trainval/lSYy6poJ2zs/50002 HOW EASY IT IS TO BELIEVE THAT THE PERSON HAS MOVED AWAY BECAUSE YOU'RE OF A DIFFERENT SKIN
trainval/lSYy6poJ2zs/50003 WHAT WILL HAPPEN THERE IS THAT THE SOUTH AMERICAN WILL BE VERY EAGER AND WILL STAND AT A DISTANCE THAT'S COMFORTABLE FOR HIM
trainval/lSYy6poJ2zs/50004 AND THAT HAS TO DO AS WELL WITH POLITENESS
trainval/LTtTfCwkIW0/50001 THE QUESTION COMES UP
trainval/LTtTfCwkIW0/50002 I M A GREETING CARD PUBLISHER
trainval/LTtTfCwkIW0/50003 BUT SO I SPENT A WEEK TRYING TO GET MY BRAIN AROUND
trainval/LTtTfCwkIW0/50004 SO MAYBE THAT S HOW ASTROLOGY GOT STARTED I DON T KNOW
trainval/lU1ISu1LOv4/50002 WHO WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSONALITY OF THE 20TH CENTURY
trainval/lU1ISu1LOv4/50003 WHO WAS THE ONE SINGLE PERSON WHO INFLUENCED OUR ATTITUDE OUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE
trainval/lU1ISu1LOv4/50004 THESE ARE THE THINGS WHY I AM SO IN LOVE WITH QUANTUM PHYSICS WHY I AM SO PASSIONATE ABOUT QUANTUM
trainval/lU1ISu1LOv4/50005 THERE IS THE VERY FAMOUS DOUBLE SLIT EXPERIMENT IN QUANTUM MECHANICS IN WHICH WE ARE CLAIMING THAT THE SAME
trainval/lU1ISu1LOv4/50006 ANOTHER THING WHICH IS VERY PECULIAR FOR QUANTUM MECHANICS IS ENTANGLEMENT OR THE NOTION OF
trainval/lU1ISu1LOv4/50007 BUT AGAIN THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING IN QUANTUM PHYSICS
trainval/lU1ISu1LOv4/50008 THIS IS ONE OF THE PARADOXES DEVISED BY ALBERT EINSTEIN WHEN HE TRIED TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT THERE ARE SOME
trainval/lU1ISu1LOv4/50009 WE CALL IT QUANTUM WAVE DUALITY
trainval/lU1ISu1LOv4/50010 AND I BELIEVE THAT QUANTUM PHYSICS IS SOMETHING IN THAT DIRECTION THAT IT IS SO COMPLICATED
trainval/lU1ISu1LOv4/50011 IF WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND QUANTUM PHYSICS NONE OF THIS WOULD BE EXISTING AROUND US
trainval/lUaSg8ZNswU/50001 BUT IN FACT WE BELIEVE THAT FUNDAMENTAL BUILDING BLOCKS OF NATURE HAVE NO SIZE AT
trainval/lUaSg8ZNswU/50002 IN THE EARLY NINETEEN THIRTIES A WHOLE NEW COMPONENT OF MATTER WAS FOUND WHICH IN SOME CELLS BEHAVE
trainval/lUaSg8ZNswU/50003 WE CAN DO SO THANKS TO THE HELP OF A MACHINE CALLED THE ANTIPROTON DECELERATOR
trainval/lUaSg8ZNswU/50004 SO LET US ENTERTAIN THE IDEA FOR A WHILE THAT ANTIMATTER BEHAVE SO UNEXPECTEDLY AS TO FALL
trainval/lUaSg8ZNswU/50005 SO CHARGE PARITY TRANSFORMS A MATTER WORLD INTO AN ANTIMATTER
trainval/lUaSg8ZNswU/50006 FOR THIS YOU NEED TO RECALL THAT WHENEVER MATTER ANTIMATTER MEET THEY GET TURNED INTO PURE LIGHT
trainval/lUaSg8ZNswU/50007 MOST LIKELY WE WILL FIND THAT MATTER AND ANTIMATTER FALL IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY IN
trainval/luFjmQJpPSU/50001 IT'S ALSO ON THE ONE BOOK ONE LINCOLN LIST FOR THIS YEAR
trainval/LuG2rf9enHE/50001 IT IS ALSO NOT AN ECONOMICAL PROPOSITION
trainval/LuG2rf9enHE/50002 IN FACT THE PROCESS HAS ALREADY STARTED
trainval/LuG2rf9enHE/50003 NOT ONLY THAT
trainval/LuG2rf9enHE/50004 WE DON'T NEED THOSE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE PLENTY OF THEM HERE
trainval/LuG2rf9enHE/50005 WE HAVE RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES WE CAN RECYCLE WE CAN DECREASE OUR POPULATION GROWTH WE CAN EVEN GET RID OF OUR
trainval/LuG2rf9enHE/50006 THAT HAPPENED TO BE MY DAY JOB
trainval/LuG2rf9enHE/50007 NOT WITH TRUCKS ACROSS MOUNTAINS BUT WITH ROCKETS TO OUR CIVILIZATION IN SPACE TO REFUEL
trainval/LuG2rf9enHE/50008 LET'S DO IT RIGHT THIS TIME
trainval/LuG2rf9enHE/50009 HOW ABOUT THE MID 2020S
trainval/lUHy84tSDrA/50001 WE NEED TO RE LOCALIZE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
trainval/lUHy84tSDrA/50002 HOW SECURE IS YOUR FOOD SUPPLY
trainval/lUHy84tSDrA/50003 SO HOW DO WE BREAK AWAY FROM THIS
trainval/lUHy84tSDrA/50004 THAT'S JUST PART OF THE CULTURE THERE
trainval/lUHy84tSDrA/50005 MY BELIEF IS THIS
trainval/luiz913mWM8/50001 THIS RECORD THAT I WROTE STARTED IN A MOTEL ROOM IN SPEARFISH SOUTH DAKOTA
trainval/LUNBiST4KSs/50001 A WORLD THAT DEMANDS WE BE MORE THAN NICE SOMETIMES
trainval/LUNBiST4KSs/50002 NICE BY ITSELF IS PARSLEY
trainval/LUNBiST4KSs/50003 IF HE SAW BANE DESTROY GOTHAM AND CHANGED THE SUBJECT TO THE WEATHER
trainval/lUO0xDSJQVI/50002 IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO DO ALL KINDS OF EXPERIMENTS AT ALL
trainval/lUO0xDSJQVI/50003 IT COSTS MANY DOLLARS TO DO ALL THE SEQUENCING AND SO FORTH
trainval/lUO0xDSJQVI/50005 SO FOR THE DIGITAL ME IT'S THE SAME THING
trainval/luoKOkTxOtU/50001 SHOTS WERE COMBINED AND I WAS JUST REALLY CURIOUS I MEAN WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU LOOKING AT JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO AND HOW
trainval/luoKOkTxOtU/50002 AND I GUESS SOMEBODY THOUGHT THEY NEEDED TO DO THAT
trainval/luoKOkTxOtU/50003 YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE A ROCKET GO UP WHILE THE GANTRY ARMS ARE GOING OUT
trainval/luoKOkTxOtU/50004 YOU WOULD NEVER EVER DESIGN A ROCKET LIKE THAT
trainval/luoKOkTxOtU/50005 IT'S LIKE YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED BUT I'M THE GUY OUT IN THE PARKING LOT RECREATING ONE OF AMERICA'S FINEST MOMENTS WITH FIRE EXTINGUISHERS
trainval/luoKOkTxOtU/50006 I'M JUST GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME FOOTAGE AND TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK
trainval/luoKOkTxOtU/50007 AND THEN I DID KIND OF GET THE REACTION I WAS HOPING FOR
trainval/luoKOkTxOtU/50008 NOW RON HOWARD RAN INTO BUZZ ALDRIN WHO WAS NOT ON THE MOVIE SO HE HAD NO IDEA THAT WE WERE FAKING ANY
trainval/luoKOkTxOtU/50010 JIM CAMERON ACTUALLY PHOTOGRAPHED THE REAL TITANIC
trainval/luoKOkTxOtU/50011 SO HE BASICALLY SET UP OR BASICALLY SHATTERED THE SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF BECAUSE WHAT HE PHOTOGRAPHED WAS THE REAL THING
trainval/lv2SjZ6tIGg/50001 IT'S LIKE LEARNING A NEW LANGUAGE
trainval/lv2SjZ6tIGg/50002 MY CHILDHOOD WAS ONE LONG ROAD TRIP THROUGH ANTIQUITY
trainval/lV3trdyDdHE/50001 I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE
trainval/lV3trdyDdHE/50002 WE MIGHT RUN UP THE STAIRS TOO QUICKLY AND WE MIGHT GET BREATHLESS
trainval/lV3trdyDdHE/50003 IT'S THE WHOLE BOOK
trainval/lV3trdyDdHE/50004 WITHOUT IT WE WOULD HAVE NO MUSIC
trainval/lV3trdyDdHE/50005 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THAT ARROW GOES AWRY
trainval/lV3trdyDdHE/50006 ARE YOU READING AN INTERVIEW BY AN AUTHOR
trainval/lV3trdyDdHE/50007 FIND OTHER BOOKS EXACTLY LIKE HIS
trainval/lV3trdyDdHE/50008 NOT JUST ARE WE ABSENT FROM IT BUT SO IS EVERYONE ELSE
trainval/lV3trdyDdHE/50009 AND THEREIN LIES ITS GREATEST CONVENIENCE AND HORROR
trainval/lV3trdyDdHE/50010 BUT THESE WERE NOT THE MAJOR PREOCCUPATIONS OF MY DAY
trainval/lV3trdyDdHE/50011 IT CANNOT BE STORED
trainval/lV3trdyDdHE/50012 ATTENTION IS TIME
trainval/lV3trdyDdHE/50013 IT THREATENS THE FLOW OF LOVE
trainval/lv9QDjw8GJk/50001 AND I WOULD GO AS FAR AS TO SAY THAT EVERY EQUATION IS LIKE THIS EVERY MATHEMATICAL EQUATION WHERE YOU
trainval/lv9QDjw8GJk/50002 WE CAN EVEN WRITE IT SIMPLY LIKE 1
trainval/lv9QDjw8GJk/50003 MY CLAIM IS THAT UNDERSTANDING HAS TO DO WITH THE ABILITY TO CHANGE YOUR PERSPECTIVE
trainval/lv9QDjw8GJk/50004 I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT HOW AMAZING REPRESENTING SOMETHING ACTUALLY IS
trainval/lv9QDjw8GJk/50005 SO THAT IS MY CLAIM
trainval/lv9QDjw8GJk/50006 WE FIND PATTERNS AND WE REPRESENT THEM
trainval/lv9QDjw8GJk/50007 AND I THINK THIS IS A NICE DAY TO DAY DEFINITION
trainval/lv9QDjw8GJk/50009 LET'S DO ANOTHER EXPERIMENT
trainval/lv9QDjw8GJk/50010 IT'S THE VOLUME OF THE SPHERE
trainval/lv9QDjw8GJk/50011 OK SO WHY AM I DOING ALL THIS
trainval/lv9QDjw8GJk/50012 TRY TO CHANGE YOUR PERSPECTIVE
trainval/LVFVaWCV1TE/50001 I AM MERELY A STORYTELLER
trainval/LVFVaWCV1TE/50002 FIND ME WHEN YOU CAN
trainval/LVFVaWCV1TE/50003 OR A GIRL WHO DECIDES THAT SHE IS GOING TO LEAVE LOVE LETTERS AROUND HER CAMPUS IN DUBUQUE IOWA ONLY TO
trainval/LVFVaWCV1TE/50004 I LEFT THEM EVERYWHERE IN CAFES AND IN LIBRARIES AT THE U
trainval/lVQ3KUTHDe0/50001 WELL I WANTED TO BE JUST LIKE DR
trainval/lVQ3KUTHDe0/50002 MY MOTHER WAS BRAVE THOUGH AND SHE HAD HOPE
trainval/lVQ3KUTHDe0/50003 THERE'S ANOTHER SIDE TO THIS FEAR
trainval/lVQ3KUTHDe0/50004 HE GAVE ALL KINDS OF REASONS
trainval/lVQ3KUTHDe0/50005 MAYBE THEY'LL GET IN THE NURSE'S WAY
trainval/lVQ3KUTHDe0/50006 AND SO WHAT DO WE DO
trainval/lVQ3KUTHDe0/50007 BECOMING A DOCTOR WAS MY DREAM
trainval/lVQ3KUTHDe0/50008 WHEN WE ASKED WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR DOCTORS
trainval/lVQ3KUTHDe0/50009 I HAD THIS ONE DOCTOR DR
trainval/lVQ3KUTHDe0/50010 WE GO BEYOND THE GOVERNMENT IN THE SUNSHINE ACT ABOUT DRUG COMPANY AFFILIATIONS AND WE TALK ABOUT
trainval/lVQ3KUTHDe0/50011 THEN WE GO ONE STEP FURTHER
trainval/lVQ3KUTHDe0/50012 WITHIN ONE WEEK OF STARTING WHO'S MY DOCTOR
trainval/lVQ3KUTHDe0/50013 I LEAVE YOU TODAY WITH A FINAL THOUGHT
trainval/lVwBFWmgIDI/50001 THE DRIZZLE OF GOLD EMBRACING THE PUNGENT SCENT OF UNTOUCHED
trainval/lw3YTbubyjI/50001 THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC FINANCIAL CRISIS HAS REIGNITED PUBLIC INTEREST IN SOMETHING THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE OLDEST
trainval/lw3YTbubyjI/50002 LINGUISTS AND COGNITIVE SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN EXPLORING THIS QUESTION FOR MANY YEARS NOW
trainval/lw3YTbubyjI/50003 NOW HOW MIGHT THAT BE
trainval/lw3YTbubyjI/50004 LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
trainval/lw3YTbubyjI/50005 SUPPOSE I WERE TALKING WITH YOU AND I WAS INTRODUCING YOU TO MY UNCLE
trainval/lw3YTbubyjI/50006 YOU UNDERSTOOD EXACTLY WHAT I JUST SAID IN ENGLISH
trainval/lw3YTbubyjI/50007 IF WE WERE SPEAKING MANDARIN CHINESE WITH EACH OTHER THOUGH I WOULDN'T HAVE THAT LUXURY
trainval/lw3YTbubyjI/50008 CHINESE DOESN'T LET ME IGNORE IT
trainval/lw3YTbubyjI/50009 WHAT I'M HERE TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT TODAY IS AN INTRIGUING NEW HYPOTHESIS AND SOME SURPRISINGLY POWERFUL NEW
trainval/lw3YTbubyjI/50010 SO MANY OF YOU KNOW IN THIS ROOM THAT ENGLISH IS A GERMANIC LANGUAGE
trainval/lw3YTbubyjI/50011 COULD HOW YOU SPEAK ABOUT TIME COULD HOW YOUR LANGUAGE FORCES YOU TO THINK ABOUT TIME AFFECT YOUR PROPENSITY TO
trainval/lw3YTbubyjI/50012 AND JUST IN SUMMARY NO MATTER HOW FAR I PUSH THIS I CAN'T GET IT TO BREAK
trainval/lw3YTbubyjI/50013 EXCUSE ME WOULD YOU MIND IF I PERUSE YOUR STOCK PORTFOLIO
trainval/lw3YTbubyjI/50014 DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW HOW MUCH YOUR HOUSE IS WORTH
trainval/lw3YTbubyjI/50015 DO YOU MIND TELLING ME
trainval/lw3YTbubyjI/50017 4 BILLION DIFFERENT WAYS THAT A FAMILY CAN FIND ITSELF
trainval/lw3YTbubyjI/50018 WOULD YOU MIND SQUEEZING AS HARD AS YOU CAN IN YOUR DOMINANT HAND THIS DEVICE SO I CAN MEASURE YOUR GRIP STRENGTH
trainval/lw3YTbubyjI/50019 WHAT WE SHOULD EXPECT THEN IS THE OPPOSITE EFFECT
trainval/lw3YTbubyjI/50020 AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE FIND
trainval/lwcvhh4pLjE/50001 SO OFTEN WHAT WE'RE TOLD IS THIS IDEA OF THE GOLDEN RULE THAT WE SHOULD TREAT OTHER PEOPLE THE WAY
trainval/lwcvhh4pLjE/50002 IT'S REASONED JUSTIFIED AND OFTEN SIGNED INTO LAW
trainval/lwcvhh4pLjE/50003 SHE HAS BEEN MY HERO SINCE DAY ONE
trainval/lwcvhh4pLjE/50004 HAD BEING TRANSGENDER SOMEHOW PRECLUDED ME FROM LOVE AND MONOGAMY
trainval/lwcvhh4pLjE/50005 SHE SAID THAT THESE WERE REMINDERS OF MY STRENGTH AND EVERYTHING THAT I WENT THROUGH AND NOTHING FOR ME TO BE ASHAMED OF
trainval/lwcvhh4pLjE/50006 IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT WE REIMAGINED SOME TRADITIONS BUT WE ALSO KEPT SOME OLD ONES THAT WE WORKED IN
trainval/lwcvhh4pLjE/50007 BUT TODAY I'M A MAN OF MY OWN INTENTION A MAN OF MY OWN DESIGN
trainval/lwcvhh4pLjE/50010 SO MANY OF US HAVE NOT RECEIVED LOVE FROM OUR FAMILIES HAVE BEEN BETRAYED BY THE PEOPLE THAT WE
trainval/lwcvhh4pLjE/50011 ONES THAT ARE ABOUT CREATING THE SPACE FOR US TO BE OUR AUTHENTIC SELVES AND NOT IMPOSING THIS
trainval/lwcvhh4pLjE/50012 AND I SAW THAT I WASN'T ALWAYS THE BEST LISTENER AND THAT MY EGO GOT IN THE WAY OF OUR PROGRESS AS A COUPLE
trainval/lwcvhh4pLjE/50013 WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HARD ON THE ISSUES BUT SOFT ON THE PERSON
trainval/lwcvhh4pLjE/50014 WE WERE ABLE TO COME BACK TOGETHER TO EACH OTHER AND RECOMMIT TO OURSELVES TO EACH OTHER AND TO
trainval/lwcvhh4pLjE/50015 I'VE STRIPPED AWAY EMOTIONAL SUPPORT INSTEAD OF FACING MY OWN VULNERABILITIES PARTICULARLY AROUND THE HEARTBREAKING
trainval/lwcvhh4pLjE/50016 SOMETIMES AS MEN WE GET TO TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT
trainval/lwcvhh4pLjE/50017 ABOUT CREATING A MANHOOD THAT ISN'T MEASURED BY THE POWER IT WIELDS BY THE ENTITLEMENTS AFFORDED TO IT
trainval/lwcvhh4pLjE/50018 WE CONSTANTLY EXPERIENCE THIS RETELLING OF HISTORY WHERE WE ARE CONSPICUOUSLY LEFT OUT
trainval/lwcvhh4pLjE/50019 QUEER LIKE A FREEDOM TOO STRANGE TO BE CONQUERED
trainval/lwcvhh4pLjE/50020 WE'VE LEARNED HOW TO LOVE EACH OTHER FOR THE LONG HAUL
trainval/lwL4hjhkid4/50001 I PROCRASTINATED BY SCROLLING THROUGH MY NEWS FEED
trainval/lwL4hjhkid4/50002 WE EQUATE BEING A GIVER SOLELY WITH THAT SECOND TYPE
trainval/lwL4hjhkid4/50003 AND I LOVED IT
trainval/lWnrS99DNeE/50001 IF CONFIRMED THIS WOULD HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON OUR DEFINITION OF LIFE ON HOW WE LOOK FOR LIFE
trainval/LWQfeSSfNbs/50001 WRIGHT TIME WAS REALLY RUNNING OUT
trainval/LWQfeSSfNbs/50002 HE HAD TUMORS THE SIZE OF ORANGES IN HIS ARMPITS NECK CHEST ABDOMEN
trainval/LWQfeSSfNbs/50003 WEST JUST COULDN'T DO THAT
trainval/LWQfeSSfNbs/50004 SO HE DOSED HIM UP ON A FRIDAY NOT EXPECTING THAT MR
trainval/LWQfeSSfNbs/50005 THEY HAD MELTED LIKE SNOWBALLS ON A HOT STOVE
trainval/LWQfeSSfNbs/50006 AND TEN DAYS AFTER GETTING THE KREBIOZEN THEY WERE GONE
trainval/LWQfeSSfNbs/50008 IT'S ACTUALLY IN THEIR PHYSIOLOGY
trainval/LWQfeSSfNbs/50009 THIS IS MEASURABLE
trainval/LWQfeSSfNbs/50010 YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE BODY
trainval/LWQfeSSfNbs/50011 I LOVE THE ROGAIN STUDIES
trainval/LWQfeSSfNbs/50012 IT'S NOT AN EASY PROCESS TO GO THROUGH ALONE SO IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE IF SOMEBODY ELSE IS HOLDING THAT POSITIVE BELIEF WITH YOU
trainval/LWQfeSSfNbs/50013 I COMPILED THEM ALL INTO MY UPCOMING BOOK MIND OVER MEDICINE
trainval/LWQfeSSfNbs/50014 BUT I WANT TO GIVE YOU A FEW HIGHLIGHTS ABOUT WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT
trainval/LWQfeSSfNbs/50015 MORE SO THAN QUITTING SMOKING OR STARTING TO EXERCISE
trainval/LWQfeSSfNbs/50016 YOUR SPIRITUAL LIFE MATTERS
trainval/LWQfeSSfNbs/50017 AND THEN ALL THOSE NATURAL SELF REPAIR MECHANISMS CAN COME INTO PLAY
trainval/LWQfeSSfNbs/50018 AS DOCTORS WE THINK WE'RE BEING REALISTIC YOU KNOW
trainval/LwSzyoYlIsA/50001 THAT MAN THE FIRST MAN IS OUT OF PRISON RIGHT NOW
trainval/LwSzyoYlIsA/50002 KERRY ROBINSON IS IN PRISON
trainval/LwSzyoYlIsA/50003 I SAID IT SEVERAL TIMES
trainval/LwSzyoYlIsA/50004 THEY GO AFTER THE GUY THEY FIND HIM THE GUY WITH THE GUN CAN'T POSSIBLY BE THE GUY WHO COMMITTED THESE RAPES
trainval/LwSzyoYlIsA/50005 HE HAS NOT THE RIGHT AGE ETC
trainval/LwSzyoYlIsA/50006 IT DOES HAPPEN IT IS A WORRY
trainval/LwSzyoYlIsA/50007 SO THEY LOOKED AT MORE LOCATIONS MORE POWERFUL STATISTICS
trainval/LwSzyoYlIsA/50008 MAYBE IT WAS CONTAMINATION
trainval/LwSzyoYlIsA/50009 I THOUGHT OH MY GOSH THIS GUY IS GOING TO GET OFF
trainval/LWULB9Aoopc/50001 IT'S FASHIONABLE AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE WHAT'S BEEN SHOWN IS THAT WITHIN THE BRAIN A WHOLE RAFT OF GENES HAVE BEEN
trainval/LWULB9Aoopc/50002 IF YOU COMPARE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS SLEPT AT NIGHT OR STAYED AWAKE
trainval/LWULB9Aoopc/50003 THIS IS THE TIME TO BE AWAKE
trainval/LWULB9Aoopc/50004 BUT STRESS IS SO MUCH MORE
trainval/LWULB9Aoopc/50005 AND SO TIRED PEOPLE TEND TO HAVE HIGHER RATES OF OVERALL INFECTION AND THERE'S SOME VERY GOOD STUDIES SHOWING THAT SHIFT
trainval/LWULB9Aoopc/50006 TURN OFF THOSE MOBILE PHONES
trainval/LWULB9Aoopc/50007 ESSENTIALLY SLEEP FRAGMENTS AND BECOMES LESS ROBUST BUT SLEEP REQUIREMENTS DO NOT GO DOWN
trainval/LWULB9Aoopc/50008 DO YOU NEED THAT MUCH OR DO YOU NEED MORE
trainval/LWULB9Aoopc/50009 SIMPLE AS THAT
trainval/lwVYaY39YbQ/50001 EVERYONE PRESUMED THEY WERE DEAD
trainval/lwVYaY39YbQ/50002 WHAT DO THEY HAVE TO GAIN BY SHARING THIS INFORMATION
trainval/lwz8KvS9NRA/50001 ALTHOUGH THERE ARE BIG SCHOOLS AND MEDICAL FACILITIES OFFERED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN THE BIGGER TOWNS AND CITIES
trainval/lwz8KvS9NRA/50002 BECAUSE OF HER THE MAJORITY OF THE CLIENTS IN THEIR WARD ARE ALSO UNAFRAID NOW TO SAY THAT THEY ARE HIV
trainval/lwz8KvS9NRA/50003 EDINA ALSO HEADS UP THE PEACE HOME
trainval/lwz8KvS9NRA/50004 IT'S ONE OF TWO HOMES THAT THE OLIVE BRANCH RUNS THAT PROVIDES CHILDREN ORPHANED BY HIV AIDS WITH A HAPPY HOME
trainval/lwz8KvS9NRA/50005 THE SCHOOLS ARE FILLED WITH POSITIVE MESSAGES AND POSTERS THAT FOSTER A SENSE OF EMPOWERMENT
trainval/lXNE4MD2X2w/50001 THE QUESTION OF WHO DEFINES YOU
trainval/lXNE4MD2X2w/50002 THINK OF HOW MANY INSTITUTIONS I CAN THINK OF THEM RIGHT NOW
trainval/lXNE4MD2X2w/50003 WE HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR X AND X AMOUNT OF YEARS SO WE CAN'T CHANGE IT NOW IT'S
trainval/lXNE4MD2X2w/50004 AND THEN I WOULD BE HARANGUED
trainval/lXNE4MD2X2w/50006 AND WHEN PEOPLE CHANGE THEN SOCIETY HAS TO AS WELL
trainval/lXNE4MD2X2w/50007 WHAT WE REALIZE ABOUT THOSE WOMEN IS THAT WHEN THEY ARE ABLE TO BREAK INTO THAT WORLD THEY MAKE AN IMPACT
trainval/lXNE4MD2X2w/50008 IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE AT THIS JUNCTION THAT I WAS SITTING AT I DIDN'T KNOW WHICH PATHWAY TO GO
trainval/lXNE4MD2X2w/50009 BUT IF YOU ASK ME THE QUESTION TODAY WHO ARE YOU AMMA
trainval/lXNE4MD2X2w/50010 WHERE ARE YOU FROM
trainval/lXNE4MD2X2w/50011 I CAN TELL YOU THIS
trainval/lxovD2LQVUQ/50001 I WENT TRAVELLING
trainval/lxovD2LQVUQ/50003 SO I DID IT
trainval/lxovD2LQVUQ/50004 SO I WAS ON TOP OF THE WORLD I WAS FEAR FREE AND RICH AND I CAN FINALLY EXPLORE ALL MY
trainval/lxovD2LQVUQ/50005 I'D WALK IN THE MOUNTAINS EVERY SECOND DAY
trainval/lxovD2LQVUQ/50006 THEN I GOT MYSELF A PIANO
trainval/lxovD2LQVUQ/50007 WHY SHOULD I PAY TO GET A PLACE TO LIVE ON
trainval/lxovD2LQVUQ/50008 SO WE ALL HAVE TO WORK AND GENERATE MONEY IN ORDER TO GET SORTED ABOUT OUR BASIC NEEDS WHICH
trainval/lxovD2LQVUQ/50009 I MEAN WE ARE THE ONES RUNNING THIS PLACE SO WE CAN DO ANYTHING
trainval/lxovD2LQVUQ/50010 SO I LEAVE YOU TONIGHT WITH AN INVITATION
trainval/lXQ4HSMp1OA/50001 AND THE OTHER MAJOR PROBLEM IS THAT MOST ACADEMICS DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF INCENTIVE TO PUBLISH OUTSIDE OF THESE PRESTIGIOUS
trainval/lXQ4HSMp1OA/50002 CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE
trainval/LXQqrR9mDMo/50001 WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SATELLITES
trainval/LXQqrR9mDMo/50002 AND WHEN WE HAVE SATELLITES WE'LL HAVE SATELLITES FOR EDUCATION FOR ENTERTAINMENT
trainval/LXQqrR9mDMo/50003 I SHOULD PUT THESE PROGRAMS UP ON SATELLITE AND SEND THEM OVER THE UNITED STATES
trainval/lxYFURQ7Ehw/50001 THROWING OVERBOARD AS BALLAST TO CHANGE OUR DIRECTION
trainval/lxYFURQ7Ehw/50003 WE FLY TWICE THE SPEED YOU PREDICTED
trainval/lxYFURQ7Ehw/50004 WHAT DO YOU REALLY WANT
trainval/lxYFURQ7Ehw/50005 WE SLOWED DOWN
trainval/lxYFURQ7Ehw/50006 WHEN WE WERE FLYING OVER THE SAHARA AND INDIA IT WAS NICE HOLIDAYS
trainval/lxYFURQ7Ehw/50007 THAT'S THE MOMENT WHEN YOU HAVE TO WAKE UP FROM THE AUTOMATIC WAY OF THINKING
trainval/lxYFURQ7Ehw/50008 YOU NEED 64 METER WINGSPAN
trainval/lxYFURQ7Ehw/50009 AND THIS IS POSSIBLE
trainval/lxYFURQ7Ehw/50010 YOU KNOW WITH THE TECHNOLOGIES WE HAVE TODAY WE CAN SAVE BETWEEN 30 AND 50 PERCENT OF THE ENERGY OF A
trainval/lYdk1NK9Sr0/50001 THE FIRST SON TOOK HIS HALF HALF OF 18 IS NINE
trainval/lYdk1NK9Sr0/50002 WE'RE ALL ONE FAMILY
trainval/lYdk1NK9Sr0/50003 HOW DO WE DEAL WITH OUR DIFFERENCES
trainval/lYdk1NK9Sr0/50004 THAT'S THE QUESTION
trainval/lYdk1NK9Sr0/50005 PERHAPS THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL WAY IN WHICH THE THIRD SIDE CAN HELP IS TO REMIND THE
trainval/lYdk1NK9Sr0/50006 HUMAN BEINGS WE'RE REACTION MACHINES
trainval/lYdk1NK9Sr0/50007 WHAT DO I KNOW ABOUT PUERTO RICO
trainval/lYdk1NK9Sr0/50008 NOW AS ANTHROPOLOGISTS WE KNOW THAT EVERY CULTURE HAS AN ORIGIN STORY
trainval/lYdk1NK9Sr0/50009 HIS BASIC MESSAGE WAS UNITY TOO THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF IT ALL THE UNITY OF IT ALL
trainval/lYdk1NK9Sr0/50010 THEY GIVE MEANING TO OUR LIVES
trainval/lYdk1NK9Sr0/50011 AND THAT'S WHAT COMES TO THE FIRST STEP HERE
trainval/lYdk1NK9Sr0/50012 YOU GO FOR A WALK IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF ABRAHAM
trainval/lYdk1NK9Sr0/50013 YOU RETRACE THE FOOTSTEPS OF ABRAHAM
trainval/lYdk1NK9Sr0/50014 WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN
trainval/lYdk1NK9Sr0/50015 WHAT IS THE STORY THERE
trainval/lYdk1NK9Sr0/50016 AND SO SHE TOLD OUR TEAM THERE SHE SAID YOU HAVE MADE ME VISIBLE
trainval/lYdk1NK9Sr0/50017 WE'RE ABOUT TO TAKE A BREAK IN A MOMENT
trainval/lYdk1NK9Sr0/50018 THAT'S A THIRD SIDE ACT
trainval/lYdk1NK9Sr0/50019 THAT'S WALKING ABRAHAM'S PATH
trainval/lYdk1NK9Sr0/50020 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/lYdk1NK9Sr0/50021 THE PATH RIGHT NOW IS LIKE AN ACORN IT'S STILL IN ITS EARLY PHASE
trainval/lYdk1NK9Sr0/50022 WHAT WOULD THE OAK TREE LOOK LIKE
trainval/LyOgVtNtEb4/50001 AND SECOND I GUESS I TRULY WANTED TO KNOW THE ANSWER
trainval/LyOgVtNtEb4/50002 IT'S NOT THE SAME ANYMORE BECAUSE THE ROLE CHANGED
trainval/LyOgVtNtEb4/50003 AND SOME OF YOU MIGHT SAY
trainval/LyOgVtNtEb4/50004 I'M NOT SAYING YOU SHOULD JOIN ME
trainval/LyOgVtNtEb4/50006 AND I'M GOING ALL THE WAY
trainval/lyu7v7nWzfo/50001 AND IN THIS PROCESS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST REMAINING MYSTERIES IN SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY
trainval/lyu7v7nWzfo/50002 SOMEHOW WITHIN EACH OF OUR BRAINS THE COMBINED ACTIVITY OF MANY BILLIONS OF NEURONS EACH ONE
trainval/lyu7v7nWzfo/50003 I'D LIKE YOU TO THINK ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE WAY THAT WE'VE COME TO THINK ABOUT LIFE
trainval/lyu7v7nWzfo/50004 YOU'RE LOCKED INSIDE A BONY SKULL TRYING TO FIGURE WHAT'S OUT THERE IN THE WORLD
trainval/lyu7v7nWzfo/50005 THERE'S NO LIGHTS INSIDE THE SKULL
trainval/lyu7v7nWzfo/50006 THE BRAIN DOESN'T HEAR SOUND OR SEE LIGHT
trainval/lyu7v7nWzfo/50008 HOW DOES THE BRAIN GENERATE THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING A BODY AND OF HAVING A BODY
trainval/lyu7v7nWzfo/50009 WELL JUST THE SAME PRINCIPLES APPLY
trainval/lyu7v7nWzfo/50010 NOW FOR MOST PEOPLE AFTER A WHILE THIS LEADS TO THE VERY UNCANNY SENSATION THAT THE FAKE HAND IS IN FACT
trainval/lyu7v7nWzfo/50011 BUT MY EXPERIENCES OF THE BODY FROM WITHIN THEY'RE NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL
trainval/lyu7v7nWzfo/50012 SO OUR MOST BASIC EXPERIENCES OF BEING A SELF OF BEING AN EMBODIED ORGANISM ARE DEEPLY GROUNDED
trainval/lyu7v7nWzfo/50013 NOTHING AT ALL
trainval/LzMJCFSAtf4/50001 ALL NON RELIGIOUS WARS
trainval/lzSkIDxbzGA/50001 IT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE
trainval/lzSkIDxbzGA/50002 AND THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF FACT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE BOASTED IN A CITY REPORT RIGHT
trainval/lzSkIDxbzGA/50003 IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE FRONT PAGE ON NYC
trainval/lzSkIDxbzGA/50004 WHEN IS RUSH HOUR EXACTLY
trainval/lzSkIDxbzGA/50005 AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF THESE CABS AREN'T JUST NUMBERS THESE ARE GPS RECORDERS DRIVING AROUND IN OUR CITY STREETS RECORDING EACH AND EVERY
trainval/lzSkIDxbzGA/50006 THERE'S JUST A RUSH DAY
trainval/lzSkIDxbzGA/50007 AND THAT'S WHERE THIS DATA CAME FROM
trainval/lzSkIDxbzGA/50008 BUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE CITIZENS WALKING AROUND WITH HARD DRIVES PICKING UP DATA FROM CITY AGENCIES TO MAKE IT PUBLIC IT WAS ALREADY KIND OF PUBLIC
trainval/lzSkIDxbzGA/50009 AND WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT AS A CITY
trainval/lzSkIDxbzGA/50010 WE DON'T NEED OUR CITIZENS WALKING AROUND WITH HARD DRIVES
trainval/lzSkIDxbzGA/50011 I'M GOING TO WRITE A PROGRAM
trainval/lzSkIDxbzGA/50012 IT'S NOT THE BEST USE OF OUR CITIZENS' TIME AND WE AS A CITY CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT
trainval/lzSkIDxbzGA/50013 NUMBER ONE NEVER SWIM IN ANYTHING THAT ENDS IN CREEK OR CANAL
trainval/lzSkIDxbzGA/50014 AND IT WASN'T JUST ME WHO FOUND A PARKING TICKET
trainval/lzSkIDxbzGA/50015 WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT AS A CITY
trainval/lzSkIDxbzGA/50016 NYC THAT ALLOWS YOU TO SUBSCRIBE TO 311 COMPLAINTS AROUND YOUR OWN HOME OR AROUND YOUR OFFICE
trainval/lzSkIDxbzGA/50017 YOU PUT IN YOUR ADDRESS YOU GET LOCAL COMPLAINTS
trainval/LZXUR4z2P9w/50001 WE DON'T HAVE BACKUP WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE NATURAL GAS
trainval/LZXUR4z2P9w/50002 SAY WE WANT TO GET TO 100 GIGAWATTS BY 2022
trainval/LZXUR4z2P9w/50003 WE WERE THERE WITH MIT AND UC BERKELEY ENGINEERS
trainval/LZXUR4z2P9w/50004 I MEAN WE WENT TO INDIA AND ASKED ABOUT THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM
trainval/LZXUR4z2P9w/50005 IT'S CAUSED BY OUR FEARS
trainval/LZXUR4z2P9w/50006 AND WHAT ABOUT THE WASTE
trainval/LZXUR4z2P9w/50007 DECIDE TO GO GET A WEAPON
trainval/LZXUR4z2P9w/50008 THAT WILL SAVE MONEY AND TIME
trainval/m048uAa8L3k/50001 AND FOR THIS REASON THEY WERE DEEPLY DISTURBED DEEPLY ALARMED AND THE ENTIRE EPIDEMIC WAS UNRAVELING
trainval/m048uAa8L3k/50002 BUT HOW DID EBOLA END UP IN LOFA COUNTY IN THE FIRST PLACE
trainval/m048uAa8L3k/50003 THIS TIME IT WAS IN NIGERIA IN THE TEEMING METROPOLIS OF LAGOS 21 MILLION
trainval/m048uAa8L3k/50004 BUT WHAT WE SAW WAS SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT
trainval/m048uAa8L3k/50005 AGENCIES AND MANY HUMANITARIAN AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAME AND JOINED THE FIGHT TO TRY AND STOP
trainval/m048uAa8L3k/50006 BUT WHAT HAD TO BE DONE THERE WAS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
trainval/m048uAa8L3k/50007 THERE WAS SO MUCH DISEASE THEY APPROACHED IT DIFFERENTLY
trainval/m048uAa8L3k/50008 AND WE SAW THE U
trainval/m048uAa8L3k/50009 BUT CAN YOU ACTUALLY DRIVE IT DOWN TO ZERO
trainval/M0yhHKWUa0g/50001 THEY DID NOT MAKE IT TO UNIVERSITY
trainval/M0yhHKWUa0g/50002 EVEN IN SALES
trainval/M0yhHKWUa0g/50003 LET ME ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS TO SEE IF THIS IS A GOOD CHOICE
trainval/M0yhHKWUa0g/50004 THEN YOU SELL A LOT MORE
trainval/m0ZPM5I1tTg/50001 SO IN MY DAY JOB I RUN THE FUTURE FOUNDATION
trainval/m0ZPM5I1tTg/50002 MAYBE THEY NEVER WILL
trainval/m0ZPM5I1tTg/50003 SO I STUMBLED IN AND I THOUGHT WHAT THE HELL I'LL GIVE THIS A GO
trainval/m0ZPM5I1tTg/50004 AND IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY MATTER HOW YOU START ON SOCIAL OR WHY YOU STARTED
trainval/m0ZPM5I1tTg/50005 BECAUSE MAYBE WHERE WE START TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A PROBLEM IS WHERE THERE IS TOO MUCH NOISE
trainval/m0ZPM5I1tTg/50006 AND WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL IN A WAY
trainval/m0ZPM5I1tTg/50007 UNRULY ARE A VIRAL VIDEO AGENCY AND THEY'VE STUDIED THIS TOO AND ACTUALLY THE
trainval/m0ZPM5I1tTg/50008 AND THE GREAT THING ABOUT EMOJIS IS WE CAN FEEL A BROADER RANGE OF THINGS
trainval/m0ZPM5I1tTg/50010 MY TIGHT TROUSERS STORY
trainval/m0ZPM5I1tTg/50011 SO ON THAT AFTERNOON I WAS THINKING YOU KNOW WHATEVER
trainval/m0ZPM5I1tTg/50012 SO I JUST PULLED MY COAT AROUND MY WAIST AND BABBLED MY WAY THROUGH THE OTHER CLASSES IN THE REST
trainval/m0ZPM5I1tTg/50013 THE SECOND REASON IS BECAUSE YOU ARE DOING IT ANYWAY
trainval/m0ZPM5I1tTg/50014 I KNOW YOU'VE ALL TAKEN THAT WHICH DISNEY PRINCESS AM I
trainval/m0ZPM5I1tTg/50015 WHAT IF YOU ARE THINKING
trainval/m0ZPM5I1tTg/50016 I KNOW I AM GOING TO HAVE TO EXAGGERATE WILDLY AMPLIFY EVERYTHING THROUGH EMOJI JUST TO GET MY POINT
trainval/m0ZPM5I1tTg/50017 IF WE CAN TELL AND SHARE SOCIALLY HOW WE FEEL IN THE FUTURE WE WILL KNOW MORE ABOUT
trainval/m0ZPM5I1tTg/50018 AND ANYONE CAN INSTIGATE THIS A PERSON A CHARITY A BRAND THAT WANTS TO DRIVE US TOWARDS GREATER
trainval/m0ZPM5I1tTg/50019 BECAUSE I'D BEEN FLASHING MY PANTS AT THE CLASS FOR THE LAST HALF AN HOUR
trainval/m1LeGwELv9o/50001 WE ARE TAUGHT NOT ONLY TO EMBRACE THIS NATURALLY BUT TO GROW FROM IT
trainval/m1LeGwELv9o/50002 PREVAILING GLOBAL ISSUES SUCH AS RACISM WE WOULD NEVER EVEN UNDERSTAND
trainval/m1LeGwELv9o/50003 I WAS SPOTTED AT A MALL ON SUKHUMVIT AND SIGNED MY CONTRACT TWO MONTHS AFTER
trainval/m1LeGwELv9o/50004 MY PARENTS HAD NO IDEA WHAT WOULD TRANSPIRE FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS
trainval/m1LeGwELv9o/50005 IT STRESSED ME OUT A LOT
trainval/m1LeGwELv9o/50006 I WAS ENVIOUS OF MY FRIENDS
trainval/m1LeGwELv9o/50007 THEY'RE SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR DREAMS
trainval/m1LeGwELv9o/50008 THEY TOOK ME TO THE TERMINALLY ILL WARD
trainval/m1LeGwELv9o/50009 THAT'S WHAT I DO BUT I THINK LIFE THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO IT
trainval/m1LeGwELv9o/50010 BUT I'M HUMAN AND THE THING ABOUT BEING HUMAN IS THAT YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO
trainval/m1LeGwELv9o/50011 I WOULD TELL YOU THAT FROM TODAY ONWARDS SOMEONE IS GOING TO DO SOMETHING TO YOU THAT WILL HURT YOU THAT WILL DISAPPOINT YOU SOMEONE WILL EMBARRASS
trainval/m1LeGwELv9o/50012 I PICKED IT UP BECAUSE IT WAS ON THE BEST SELLER LIST AND IT WAS THE SMALLEST ONE
trainval/M1o3FS0awtk/50001 WE HAVE FOCUSED ON THE WORST CASE SCENARIO
trainval/M1o3FS0awtk/50002 MAYBE SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD DON'T BUT WE HAVE ENOUGH
trainval/M1o3FS0awtk/50003 HE'D BE ASKING US TO REDESIGN OUR NATIONAL ACCOUNTING SYSTEM TO BE BASED UPON
trainval/M1o3FS0awtk/50004 WE ALL NEED TO LOVE AND BE LOVED IN LIFE
trainval/M1o3FS0awtk/50005 THEY ARE THE HAPPIEST PLACE
trainval/M1o3FS0awtk/50006 AND THEY HAVE THAT LATIN VIBE DON'T THEY
trainval/M1o3FS0awtk/50007 MAYBE SOME OF YOU HAVE
trainval/M1o3FS0awtk/50008 WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE FOR SOCIETY
trainval/M1o3FS0awtk/50009 THE SECOND ONE IS BE ACTIVE
trainval/M1o3FS0awtk/50010 PAVE THEM WITH THE FIVE WAYS
trainval/M1yCvKASWdU/50001 WHO WAS NOT CONSIDERED AN INDIAN
trainval/M1yCvKASWdU/50002 WE ENDED UP WITH THE RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS
trainval/M1yCvKASWdU/50003 WE WANTED LAND
trainval/M1yCvKASWdU/50004 WE ENDED UP WITH THE RESERVES
trainval/M1yCvKASWdU/50005 YOU CAN'T BE SAYING THAT ABOUT ME
trainval/M1yCvKASWdU/50006 IT'S ABOUT SPIRITUALITY CULTURE VALUES
trainval/M1yCvKASWdU/50007 I'M NOT A YOUTH
trainval/M3mnUMmUAHQ/50001 BUT I WAS SURPRISED TO BE INTRIGUED BY THE CONTOUR OF HER LOWER BACK
trainval/M3mnUMmUAHQ/50002 YOU WANT ME TO SEE YOU ONLY IN CANDLELIGHT AND TO SQUINT
trainval/M3mnUMmUAHQ/50003 YOU MOVE OR FACE THE LIGHT AND I SEE YOU
trainval/M3mnUMmUAHQ/50004 NOW THERE IS WORK TO DO THERE ARE ROLES TO PLAY
trainval/M3mnUMmUAHQ/50005 IT'S THE STORY OF HOW A LOVELY 15 YEAR RELATIONSHIP MET ITS RAPID DEMISE WHEN MY
trainval/M3mnUMmUAHQ/50006 BUT DESPITE THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EFFORT I PUT INTO SUPPORTING JAIME LOVE WAS NOT
trainval/M3mnUMmUAHQ/50007 WITHIN 18 SHORT MONTHS MY MARRIAGE FAILED SPECTACULARLY
trainval/M3mnUMmUAHQ/50008 AND I ENTERED INTO THAT RELATIONSHIP AS A HETEROSEXUAL ONE WITH A MAN AND THAT IS HOW
trainval/M3mnUMmUAHQ/50009 A COUPLE OF THINGS ABOUT MY STORY
trainval/M3mnUMmUAHQ/50010 HE EVEN TOOK PRIDE IN GROWING A LARGE HIPSTER BEARD
trainval/M3mnUMmUAHQ/50011 HE SAID HE WAS HAPPY BEING A MAN
trainval/M3mnUMmUAHQ/50012 JAIME COULDN'T RECONCILE HATING HIS BODY WITH ALLOWING ME TO LOVE IT
trainval/M3mnUMmUAHQ/50013 AND HE COULDN'T RECONCILE HATING HIS BODY WITH USING IT FOR PLEASURE
trainval/M3mnUMmUAHQ/50014 AND WHEN I SAW THAT MY SEX LIFE WOULD BE SACRIFICED FOR JAIME'S PRIORITIES THAT
trainval/M3mnUMmUAHQ/50015 JAIME STOPPED HAVING FRANK CONVERSATIONS WITH ME EVEN ABOUT MATTERS THAT DEEPLY AFFECTED OUR LIVES LIKE WHETHER OR NOT
trainval/M3mnUMmUAHQ/50016 SO WE WEREN'T HAVING SEX WE WEREN'T TALKING WE WEREN'T EVEN ENJOYING HOBBIES TOGETHER
trainval/M3mnUMmUAHQ/50017 HE EVEN LOST INTEREST IN HOBBIES
trainval/M3mnUMmUAHQ/50018 THE NUMBER OF AMERICANS AND PEOPLE ACROSS THE WORLD WHO ARE IDENTIFYING AS TRANSGENDER HAS INCREASED SHARPLY
trainval/M3mnUMmUAHQ/50019 OUR SEX LIFE BEGAN TO SUFFER
trainval/M3mnUMmUAHQ/50020 AND THIS WAS BEFORE JAIME WENT ON HORMONES
trainval/m45SshJqOP4/50001 EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT BEING SMART
trainval/m45SshJqOP4/50002 BUT ARE WE READY TO BE SMART
trainval/m45SshJqOP4/50003 HOW MUCH SUN ACTUALLY FALLS ON THE SURFACES OF THE TOWN AND ON THE BUILDINGS
trainval/m45SshJqOP4/50004 FOR EXAMPLE IF MANY OF THE SOLAR PANELS ARE NOT COLLECTING A LOT OF ENERGY IT MIGHT
trainval/m45SshJqOP4/50005 AND THEY CAN EVEN PREDICT A POTENTIAL FAILURE BEFORE IT EVEN HAPPENS SO THAT WE CAN GO AND FIX IT
trainval/m45SshJqOP4/50006 WE PUT IN RAINWATER HARVESTING SYSTEMS
trainval/m45SshJqOP4/50007 SO WITH AN AGEING POPULATION SUCH SMART SOLUTIONS ARE ACTUALLY VERY USEFUL
trainval/m45SshJqOP4/50008 AND DO YOU KNOW THAT IT CAN EVEN DO THIS
trainval/m4GQk4ufRKs/50001 I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE MY FATHER EXCEPT I NOTICED THE CREATURE HAD LONG HAIR
trainval/M4soSZ9aSu0/50001 SO WHAT I'M DOING I'M STAGING THESE KINDS OF FEARS IN FRONT OF THE AUDIENCE
trainval/M4soSZ9aSu0/50002 AND ONE VERY IMPORTANT PIECE I MADE IN THOSE DAYS WAS BALKAN BAROQUE
trainval/M4soSZ9aSu0/50003 AND THEN AFTER THIS IS PERFORMANCE AND THEN EVERYTHING ELSE
trainval/M4soSZ9aSu0/50004 BUT IT'S SIX HOURS THE EXPERIENCE
trainval/M5tre30cRwU/50001 AND THE BOY RAISED HIS HAND AND HE SAID MR
trainval/M5tre30cRwU/50002 AND AS WELL LIKE SCHEHERAZADE THEY WERE WELL EDUCATED WOMAN
trainval/M5tre30cRwU/50003 PLEASE SISTER ALLOW ME TO SEE YOUR FACE ONE LAST TIME
trainval/M5tre30cRwU/50004 AND NOW YOU COULD SEE THEM
trainval/M5tre30cRwU/50005 PLEASE TELL ME WHAT HAVE I DONE
trainval/m7C6aiZV9JE/50001 WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN BETWEEN THE HOSTEL AND THE FLIGHT
trainval/m7C6aiZV9JE/50002 I'LL TELL YOU
trainval/m7C6aiZV9JE/50003 I SPENT ONE WEEK THERE
trainval/m7C6aiZV9JE/50004 SO IT'S JUST ENOUGH TO TAKE CARE OF OTHER PEOPLE TO TAKE CARE OF WHAT SURROUNDS US TO ENJOY
trainval/m7C6aiZV9JE/50005 BUT MY WAY OF DOING IT WAS LIKE HEY I'M CRISTINA I GOT CANCER
trainval/m7C6aiZV9JE/50006 SO I DECIDED TO WALK AROUND
trainval/m7C6aiZV9JE/50007 I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO GO AND HE WAS WALKING IN THE SAME WAY
trainval/m7C6aiZV9JE/50008 I LOVE NATALIE
trainval/m7SuKQGPMSw/50001 I'VE GOT TO GIVE A PRESENTATION TO THE BOARD THIS AFTERNOON AND I ONLY JUST FOUND OUT
trainval/m7SuKQGPMSw/50002 AND I REMEMBER THINKING NO
trainval/m7SuKQGPMSw/50003 I CAN'T DIE YET
trainval/m7SuKQGPMSw/50004 I HAD TO BUILD MY DAILY HABITS FROM THE GROUND UP
trainval/m7SuKQGPMSw/50005 I HAD TO LEARN TO GET VERY CLEAR ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT WAS WITHIN MY CONTROL AND DELIVER THAT
trainval/m7SuKQGPMSw/50006 THEY EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE THEIR TALENTS FROM ANYWHERE
trainval/M8CTOjQhJFo/50001 IN RURAL AFRICAN POPULATIONS THAT ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THE GRID AND EVEN OFTEN UNBANKED
trainval/M8CTOjQhJFo/50002 GENERATION HAS BEEN MANAGING 11 BILLION DOLLARS OF PUBLIC EQUITIES ON BEHALF OF OUR CLIENTS WHERE WE'VE BEEN INTEGRATING
trainval/M8CTOjQhJFo/50003 WE DON'T PUBLISH OUR TRACK RECORD ON A REGULAR BASIS BUT OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS OUR OUTCOMES FOR OUR
trainval/M8CTOjQhJFo/50004 AT GENERATION WE CALL THE OTHER TWO THIRDS OF THOSE RESERVES STRANDED ASSETS ASSETS WHOSE ECONOMIC VALUE WILL
trainval/M8CTOjQhJFo/50005 GO BACK TO THE MORTGAGE AND FUEL CRISES OF 2008
trainval/M8CTOjQhJFo/50006 WHY WERE PEOPLE STILL ALLOCATING CAPITAL AND MARKETS THAT WERE OBVIOUSLY STILL A BUBBLE
trainval/M8CTOjQhJFo/50007 NEXT TIME THAT YOU'RE INVESTING YOUR PERSONAL SAVINGS OR YOUR PENSION ASK SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE THAT CAPITAL IS
trainval/M8CTOjQhJFo/50008 BECOME BETTER INFORMED ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND DRIVE THE MESSAGE FORWARD BECAUSE TO CHANGE THE
trainval/M9pPgIraoOM/50002 THUS ITS NOVELTY NOT SIMPLY SEX IN GENERAL THAT FROM A BIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE DOMINATED MALE AROUSAL
trainval/M9pPgIraoOM/50003 THIS QUICKLY SPIRALS DOWNWARDS AS VIEWERS PURSUE EVER MORE EXTREME PORN TO GET THE SAME HIGH
trainval/M9pPgIraoOM/50004 WELL BUILDING AND MAINTAINING A LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP OR A MARRIAGE CAN ALREADY BE CHALLENGING
trainval/M9pPgIraoOM/50005 AND WE GET A SENSE OF JUST HOW BIG OF A DEAL PORNOGRAPHY REALLY ITS
trainval/M9pPgIraoOM/50006 IT SERVES TO PROVIDE PEER SUPPORT FOR THOSE TRYING TO REBOOT THEIR SEXUALITY BY GOING LONG PERIODS OF TIME OFTEN MONTHS
trainval/M9pPgIraoOM/50007 NOW I GREW UP CHRISTIAN AND I CERTAINLY IDENTIFY AS CHRISTIAN TODAY
trainval/mA1vshSuyQU/50001 WHEN I WAS A CHILD I WOULD SIT ON THE FLOOR LIKE I AM SURE MANY OF YOU HAVE SURROUNDED BY
trainval/mA1vshSuyQU/50002 THERE IS SOMETHING INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ABOUT TELLING STORIES IN PICTURES ABOUT
trainval/mA1vshSuyQU/50003 I THINK THAT IT'S THIS KIND OF PRIMITIVE AND PRIMAL NATURE OF VISUAL STORYTELLING WHICH HAS CAUSED
trainval/mA1vshSuyQU/50004 5 OF TRADITIONAL TEXT BASED BOOKS IN THE UK ARE ACTUALLY
trainval/mA1vshSuyQU/50005 I WAS INVITED ALONGSIDE SEVERAL DIFFERENT COMIC ARTISTS FROM ALL OVER EUROPE FROM
trainval/mA1vshSuyQU/50006 I'VE WITNESSED THIS MYSELF AS I RUN WORKSHOPS FOR PEOPLE FROM ALL DIFFERENT WALKS OF LIFE FROM
trainval/mA1vshSuyQU/50007 REPEATEDLY EVEN COLONEL GADDAFI CREATED A PROPAGANDA BIOGRAPHY
trainval/mA1vshSuyQU/50008 AND THAT IS HOW I FOUND MYSELF IN APRIL SITTING IN THE OFFICES OF THE BRITISH RED CROSS ON A
trainval/mA1vshSuyQU/50009 I WAS TO BE HONEST FAIRLY WEARY AND NERVOUS ABOUT MEETING EBRAHIM
trainval/mA1vshSuyQU/50011 IT WAS PICKED UP IN SOCIAL MEDIA AND TWEETED ABOUT BY THE LIKES OF NEIL GAIMAN SIMON PEGG
trainval/mA1vshSuyQU/50012 IT WAS EVEN SPOTTED BEING READ BY HOME OFFICE DELEGATES ON A PLANE FOLLOWING A CONFERENCE
trainval/mA1vshSuyQU/50013 THE BRITISH RED CROSS GAVE COMICS A CHANCE AND SAW HOW THEY WERE ABLE TO CREATE A NEW STORY AND SPREAD THEIR
trainval/mA1vshSuyQU/50014 AND IT IS MY HOPE THAT MORE PEOPLE WILL START TO TAKE THE MEDIUM OF COMICS MORE SERIOUSLY
trainval/mA1vshSuyQU/50015 THIS REFUGEE WAS ONE OF THE 1000 REFUGEES UNDER THE AGE OF 18 WHO ARRIVE IN THE
trainval/mAAxykQH0Wo/50001 WATSON WAS IN FACT LISTENING TO VERY LOW FREQUENCY RADIO EMISSIONS CAUSED BY NATURE
trainval/MacRhth2lMM/50005 BUT I'M GIVING A TEDX TALK AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW HAPPY MY MOTHER
trainval/maCww8AXIvg/50001 WHEN I REFLECT ON THOSE TWO WORDS LET ME TRY TO DO THAT
trainval/maCww8AXIvg/50002 AND AS A RESULT OUR HAPPINESS
trainval/maMU4XZYdtQ/50001 DID YOU THINK YOU WERE GOING TO BE IN AN ACCIDENT
trainval/maMU4XZYdtQ/50002 OF COURSE NOT
trainval/MAQihRikgZM/50001 BECAUSE NO ONE CHILD CAN MOVE A 6 FOOT LONG LINCOLN LOG
trainval/MAQihRikgZM/50002 AND WE KNOW WHEN YOU THINK BACK TO YOUR EXPERIENCES AS A CHILD THAT IT IS THOSE EARLY RELATIONSHIPS WITH THOSE
trainval/MAQihRikgZM/50003 AND THESE ARE ALL USING TECHNOLOGIES THAT EXIST NOW
trainval/MAQihRikgZM/50004 IT WAS REALLY FRUSTRATING FOR HIM
trainval/MAQihRikgZM/50005 I BROKE IT AGAIN I GOT TO RESTORE IT
trainval/MAQihRikgZM/50006 A GARDEN PLOT THAT HE HAD PLANTED THAT HE HAD TAKEN CARE OF AND AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS LEARNING BOTANY AND
trainval/MAQihRikgZM/50007 EVERBODY WOULD START AT THE SAME TIME AND THEY'D END AT THE SAME TIME
trainval/MAQihRikgZM/50008 WELL WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WASN'T WORKING
trainval/MAQihRikgZM/50009 AND THERE ARE LEARNING HIGH LEVEL COMPUTER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
trainval/MAQihRikgZM/50011 THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE HAVING FUN
trainval/mArrNRWQEso/50001 NOW THAT'S AN IMPORTANT CONCEPT
trainval/mArrNRWQEso/50002 IT HAS TO DO WITH LANGUAGES
trainval/mArrNRWQEso/50003 IT IS SECURITY AND PRIVACY
trainval/mArrNRWQEso/50004 GIVE ME A SENSE OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF YOUR OWN MIND
trainval/mArrNRWQEso/50005 YOU HAVE THIS IDEA OF GOOGLE X
trainval/mArrNRWQEso/50006 YOU LEARN THAT THE BALLOONS ARE POSSIBLE BECAUSE THERE'S SOME MATERIAL THAT WILL WORK FOR THEM
trainval/mArrNRWQEso/50007 CR IT IS GREAT TO SEE YOU HERE
trainval/mArrNRWQEso/50008 IT'S GREAT TO HEAR FROM YOU AND A PLEASURE TO SIT AT THIS TABLE WITH YOU
trainval/mAvSoNUgMno/50001 999 PERCENT OF TWEETS POSE NO RISK TO ANYONE
trainval/mAvSoNUgMno/50002 THERE'S NO THREAT INVOLVED
trainval/mAvSoNUgMno/50003 THAT'S PRETTY CLEARLY NOT A GOOD THING
trainval/mAvSoNUgMno/50004 SO WHY ARE THE STAKES HIGHER FOR THIS
trainval/mAvSoNUgMno/50005 IT'S TO THINK OF WHAT COULD GO WRONG
trainval/mAvSoNUgMno/50006 THERE'S NO RISK INVOLVED
trainval/mAvSoNUgMno/50007 MY JOB IS TO ROOT OUT AND PREVENT ACTIVITY THAT MIGHT
trainval/MB7seqSbMvw/50001 THINGS LIKE WHAT
trainval/Mb8x6vLcggc/50001 AND WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT IS ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE GENERATING THROUGH OUR INTERACTION WITH AND OVER THE INTERNET
trainval/Mb8x6vLcggc/50002 WE DON'T KNOW AND THIS IS REALLY AMAZING TO ME WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY CHILDREN WERE BORN OR
trainval/Mb8x6vLcggc/50003 WE HAVE PAPER FORMS TO TRACK PEOPLE WHO COME INTO CLINICS
trainval/Mb8x6vLcggc/50004 SOMETIMES IT CAN TAKE TWO YEARS TO TYPE THAT INFORMATION INTO A COMPUTER AND SOMETIMES ACTUALLY NOT INFREQUENTLY
trainval/Mb8x6vLcggc/50005 NOW TRY AND WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND THAT FOR A SECOND
trainval/Mb8x6vLcggc/50006 YOU JUST HAD TEAMS OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
trainval/Mb8x6vLcggc/50007 NOW 1995 OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS QUITE A LONG TIME AGO
trainval/Mb8x6vLcggc/50008 AND UNFORTUNATELY AFTER THINKING ABOUT THIS FOR SOME TIME I IDENTIFIED THE MAIN OBSTACLE
trainval/Mb8x6vLcggc/50009 IT'S ALWAYS GUYS THAT LOOK PRETTY MUCH LIKE ME FLYING FROM COUNTRIES THAT LOOK PRETTY MUCH LIKE THIS TO OTHER
trainval/Mb8x6vLcggc/50010 AND YOU GO OUT THERE AND YOU SPEND MONEY ON AIRFARE AND YOU SPEND TIME AND YOU SPEND PER DIEM AND YOU
trainval/Mb8x6vLcggc/50011 AS FAR AS I KNEW THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD DISTRIBUTE TECHNOLOGY AND I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT A WAY AROUND IT
trainval/Mb8x6vLcggc/50012 SO THESE GUYS ARE DISTRIBUTING TECHNOLOGY GETTING SOFTWARE CAPACITY OUT THERE BUT THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY FLYING AROUND THE WORLD
trainval/Mb8x6vLcggc/50013 I NEED TO THINK ABOUT THIS MORE
trainval/Mb8x6vLcggc/50014 WHILE I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT PEOPLE STARTED USING EVEN MORE THINGS LIKE THIS JUST AS WE WERE
trainval/Mb8x6vLcggc/50015 NOW WE KNEW WHEN WE BUILT THIS SYSTEM THE WHOLE POINT OF IT JUST LIKE WITH THE PALMPILOTS WAS THAT YOU'D BE
trainval/Mb8x6vLcggc/50016 THAT'S LESS THAN I USED TO GET JUST TRAVELING OUT FOR TWO WEEKS TO DO A CONSULTATION
trainval/Mb8x6vLcggc/50017 AND SO I BEGAN TO RACK MY BRAIN TRYING TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WAS THE PROCESS THAT I WAS DOING
trainval/Mb8x6vLcggc/50018 HOW WAS I TRAINING FOLKS AND WHAT WERE THE BOTTLENECKS AND WHAT WERE THE OBSTACLES TO DOING IT FASTER AND TO
trainval/mbbMLOZjUYI/50001 BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED
trainval/mbbMLOZjUYI/50002 I DON'T LIVE IN A TOWNSHIP
trainval/mbbMLOZjUYI/50003 SO HERE'S MY QUESTION
trainval/mbbMLOZjUYI/50004 THERE IS SOME GOOD NEWS
trainval/mbbMLOZjUYI/50005 I GOT SOME BAD NEWS
trainval/mbbMLOZjUYI/50006 WE ARE NOT EQUIPPED FOR THE 21ST CENTURY
trainval/mbbMLOZjUYI/50007 WHAT ONCE MADE YOU SAFE NOW DRIVES YOU INSANE
trainval/mbbMLOZjUYI/50008 BUT MY POINT IS IF WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THIS STUFF AND WE DON'T LEARN HOW TO DEAL WITH OUR LIVES IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ONE IN FOUR
trainval/MbdxeFcQtaU/50001 ARE YOU SAYING THAT I AM A RACIST
trainval/MbdxeFcQtaU/50003 I REALLY APPRECIATED THE PERSPECTIVE YOU GAVE ABOUT STAYING FOCUSED ON WHAT YOU ARE CONVERSATION
trainval/MbdxeFcQtaU/50004 AND THE SECOND TYPE OF FEEDBACK I GET IS
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50001 SO BUDDHA'S TEACHING HAS LOST ITS MOMENTUM
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50002 AND HE BECAME INTERESTED IN THAT
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50003 HE WENT BACK TO HIS CAVE
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50004 SO HE SAID ALL RIGHT
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50005 I GET THE POINT
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50006 HE WENT BACK
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50007 AND SO AGAIN HE GOES BACK
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50008 AND HE'S FREAKED OUT
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50010 AND MAITREYA SAYS I WAS WITH YOU
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50011 AND MAITREYA THEN KEPT HIM IN HEAVEN FOR FIVE YEARS DICTATING TO HIM FIVE COMPLICATED
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50012 AND I SHOULD DO SOMETHING
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50013 I HAD FIGHTS WITH THEM
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50014 SOMETIMES THEY WERE UNFRIENDLY
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50015 BROTHERS CAN FIGHT
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50016 THEY COULD ALL BE JUST FINE
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50017 SO MY MOTHER IN THIS LIFE IS REALLY GREAT
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50018 AND WE SEE THE MOTHER IN EVERY BEING
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50019 SO NATURALLY THEY CHASED HIM OUT OF TOWN
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50020 NOBODY SEEMS ALIEN
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50021 YOU WILL EVEN WEEP PERHAPS WITH GRATITUDE AND KINDNESS
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50022 AND THEN THE FOURTH STEP YOU GO TO WHAT IS CALLED LOVELY LOVE
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50023 SO THAT ENCOURAGED HIM AND HE WENT WITH MAITREYA
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50024 WHEN THEY'RE ANGRY THEY LOOK UGLY EVERY BEING BUT WHEN THEY'RE HAPPY THEY LOOK BEAUTIFUL
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50025 NICE FOR HIM TO SAY IT BUT I CAN'T DO THAT
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50026 THEY WOULD BE RELAXING SOMEWHERE HAVING A GOOD TIME
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50028 AND YOU LOOK AT THEM AND YOU SEE HOW THEY ARE
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50029 THERE IS NO WAY NOT TO DO IT
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50030 YOU CAN DEVELOP THIS
trainval/MBZyRlxVdSE/50031 AND THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT THE CHARTER OF COMPASSION MUST LEAD US TO DEVELOP THROUGH TRUE COMPASSION
trainval/McDjnRcUcfM/50001 ELEGANCE MEETS VIOLENCE
trainval/McDjnRcUcfM/50002 MAYBE IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH CONFLICT RESOLUTION
trainval/MCeaijwHxS0/50001 SOUTH AFRICA WAS A COUNTRY WHERE I MADE MY FIRST MY ONLY BEST FRIEND AND IN ADDITION TO THE FRIENDS I
trainval/MCeaijwHxS0/50002 AND WHILE MUCH OF MY SENSE OF HAPPINESS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE FACT THAT I AM A MOTIVATED AND OPTIMISTIC
trainval/MCeaijwHxS0/50003 OUR FAMILY HAD TO RUN
trainval/mclzytQQMGI/50001 BUT OF COURSE THE TASK IS TO CREATE THE INSTITUTIONS THAT MAKE THAT GLOBAL SOCIETY WORK
trainval/mclzytQQMGI/50002 SO YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A HEALTHY SENSE OF PATRIOTISM THAT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT
trainval/mclzytQQMGI/50003 BUT YOU'VE GOT TO REALIZE THAT THIS WORLD HAS CHANGED FUNDAMENTALLY AND THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE CANNOT BE SOLVED BY ONE
trainval/mclzytQQMGI/50004 AND THEN SOMEONE SAYS HOW SHOULD I KNOW
trainval/mclzytQQMGI/50005 I JUST THINK WE'RE NOT SEEING AT THE MOMENT THE HUGE OPPORTUNITIES OPEN TO US BY THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO
trainval/mclzytQQMGI/50006 SO I COME BACK TO MY INITIAL POINT
trainval/mclzytQQMGI/50007 SOMETIMES YOU THINK THINGS ARE IMPOSSIBLE
trainval/mclzytQQMGI/50008 YOU'RE BUILDING ON PEOPLE'S IDEAS AND VALUES THAT PERHAPS THEY'RE
trainval/mclzytQQMGI/50010 IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT EVERYBODY DOES EXACTLY THE SAME THING BECAUSE WE'VE ACTUALLY GOT TO DO MORE FINANCIALLY TO HELP THE POOREST
trainval/mclzytQQMGI/50011 BUT WE DID GET AN AGREEMENT ON CLIMATE CHANGE
trainval/mclzytQQMGI/50012 AMERICA HAS MADE ITS FIRST DISPOSITION ON THIS WITH THE BILL THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA SHOULD BE
trainval/mclzytQQMGI/50013 JAPAN HAS MADE AN ANNOUNCEMENT
trainval/mclzytQQMGI/50014 AND WE WOULD HELP THEM ADAPT
trainval/mclzytQQMGI/50015 AND GOD SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SAID NOT THIS YEAR NOT THIS DECADE PERHAPS NOT EVEN IN YOUR LIFETIME
trainval/mclzytQQMGI/50016 THEY DON'T DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS
trainval/MDL85fzdc1g/50001 IS IT INNATE OR DEVELOPED
trainval/MDL85fzdc1g/50002 I TRAINED THE TOP US OLYMPIAN AS WELL
trainval/MDL85fzdc1g/50003 DID YOU HEAR WHAT I WAS JUST SAYING
trainval/MDL85fzdc1g/50004 LIFE IS ALWAYS GOING TO COME DOWN TO THAT WHETHER IT TAKES US A FEW MINUTES OR A FEW MONTHS OR YEARS
trainval/MDL85fzdc1g/50005 THE QUESTION ALWAYS REMAINS BEFORE US
trainval/MDL85fzdc1g/50006 HE SAID COME ON I'LL GIVE YOU 5 IF YOU CAN SLAP ME ON THE CHEEK
trainval/MDL85fzdc1g/50007 IF YOU WANT TO BECOME OBSESSED ABOUT SOMETHING I'LL TELL YOU HOW
trainval/MDL85fzdc1g/50008 HOW ABOUT OUR EMOTIONS
trainval/MDL85fzdc1g/50009 CAN WE CONTROL OUR EMOTIONS
trainval/MDL85fzdc1g/50010 I WOULD JUST SAY HI MY NAME IS DAN
trainval/MDL85fzdc1g/50011 I HAVE TO TELL YOU
trainval/MDL85fzdc1g/50012 I SAID DON'T WORRY
trainval/MDL85fzdc1g/50013 SO THIS IS MY LITTLE SECRET TO GIVE YOU
trainval/MDL85fzdc1g/50014 AND THE DAY AFTER THAT DO ONE JUMPING JACK
trainval/MDqyOLCFJ3c/50001 I THOUGHT I HAD SEEN THE WORLD DISH OUT SOME PRETTY NASTY STUFF TO ANIMALS AT THAT POINT BUT IT PALED IN
trainval/MDqyOLCFJ3c/50002 CAMP KATRINA WAS RUN BY THE HUMANE SOCIETY OF LOUISIANA AND IT WAS BASICALLY A HASTILY
trainval/MDqyOLCFJ3c/50003 SOMETIMES IN VERY SURPRISING WAYS
trainval/mDSuP2BsVy4/50001 THAT IS THAT FEELING YOU GET WHEN YOU'VE READ A GREAT BOOK
trainval/mDSuP2BsVy4/50002 THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS TO TELL SOMEONE ABOUT IT
trainval/mDSuP2BsVy4/50003 READING MAKES US BETTER
trainval/mDSuP2BsVy4/50004 WERE THEY BETTER WRITTEN
trainval/mDSuP2BsVy4/50005 DID THEY HAVE STRONGER COVERS
trainval/mDSuP2BsVy4/50006 IF YOU CAN WRITE A NOVEL THAT ONLY YOU COULD'VE WRITTEN AT THAT TIME IN THAT WAY THEN YOU MIGHT GET YOUR
trainval/mDSuP2BsVy4/50007 AND TO BE HONEST AUTHORS FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT
trainval/mDSuP2BsVy4/50009 AND IT DOESN'T SELL A COPY
trainval/mDSuP2BsVy4/50010 PARTICULARLY MALE ABSENCE
trainval/mDSuP2BsVy4/50011 BUT I THINK YOU'LL GET THIS IF YOU ENJOY READING
trainval/mDSuP2BsVy4/50012 BUT I OFTEN SAT IN MY OFFICE WITH YOUNG WRITERS AND SAID TO THEM WHAT'S YOUR STORY ABOUT
trainval/mDSuP2BsVy4/50013 THEY'VE SAID IT'S ABOUT LOVE DEATH MARRIAGE REDEMPTION BETRAYAL
trainval/mDSuP2BsVy4/50014 ANY OTHER STORIES
trainval/mDSuP2BsVy4/50016 THIS WAS THE PICTURE
trainval/mDSuP2BsVy4/50017 BUT I DISCOVERED THE AUTHOR AND TOGETHER WE FOUND A WAY TO DISCOVER THE RIGHT STORY TO
trainval/mDSuP2BsVy4/50018 ALL TO TRY AND GET US TO BUY THE BOOK
trainval/mDSuP2BsVy4/50019 WE ALLOW THEM TO HAPPEN
trainval/ME0OeqjnVAw/50001 IN MY REHABILITATION I MADE A VOW
trainval/ME0OeqjnVAw/50002 HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT HIGHER TAXES AND LOWER REAL WAGES
trainval/ME0OeqjnVAw/50003 THAT PRICE WOULD BE PAID FOR MANY DECADES TO COME
trainval/ME0OeqjnVAw/50004 SO I SIMPLY ASK
trainval/ME0OeqjnVAw/50005 WE NEED A ROBUST PROFITABLE AND HEALTHY BANKING SECTOR IN OUR SOCIETY
trainval/ME0OeqjnVAw/50006 BANKS JUST WENT TO BEING BANKS AGAIN
trainval/ME0OeqjnVAw/50007 PEEL BACK THE ONION
trainval/ME0OeqjnVAw/50008 THE GOOD BANK WOULD NOT HAVE CLIENTS IT WOULD ONLY HAVE CUSTOMERS
trainval/ME0OeqjnVAw/50009 THOSE CUSTOMERS WOULD BE THOSE WORST AFFECTED BY THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS
trainval/ME0OeqjnVAw/50010 THE GOOD BANK WOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT INSIDIOUS DISEASE THAT TERMINAL ILLNESS INFLICTED ON YOUNG PEOPLE CALLED A LIFETIME OF
trainval/ME0OeqjnVAw/50011 BECAUSE THE GOOD BANK BELIEVES IN HAVING SMART CUSTOMERS
trainval/ME0OeqjnVAw/50013 HUMAN INGENUITY IS AN UNSTOPPABLE FORCE IN A FREE SOCIETY
trainval/ME0OeqjnVAw/50014 WE DON'T WANT A SYSTEM THAT IS TOO BIG TO FAIL WE WANT A SYSTEM THAT IS TOO GOOD TO FAIL
trainval/ME0OeqjnVAw/50015 IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT ENRICHING A CHOSEN FEW
trainval/MEDgtjpycYg/50001 THE COMPANY WAS SO OFFENDED THEY LITERALLY WITHDREW THE OFFER AND MY BROTHER WAS LEFT WITH NOTHING
trainval/MEDgtjpycYg/50002 AND THROUGH THESE EXPERIENCES I'VE COME TO RECOGNIZE THAT EACH OF US HAVE SOMETHING CALLED A RANGE OF ACCEPTABLE
trainval/MEDgtjpycYg/50003 THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WITH MY WIFE AND I
trainval/MEDgtjpycYg/50004 POWER COMES IN LOTS OF FORMS
trainval/MEDgtjpycYg/50005 WE HAVE VERY LITTLE LEEWAY
trainval/MEDgtjpycYg/50006 THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN OUR RANGE NARROWS THAT PRODUCES SOMETHING CALLED THE LOW POWER
trainval/MEDgtjpycYg/50007 SO WE WORRIED
trainval/MEDgtjpycYg/50008 BUT HANNAH RILEY BOWLES AND EMILY AMANATULLAH HAVE DISCOVERED THERE'S ONE SITUATION WHERE WOMEN GET THE SAME
trainval/MEDgtjpycYg/50009 THEY BECOME MORE ASSERTIVE
trainval/MEDgtjpycYg/50010 HOW DO WE DO THAT
trainval/MEDgtjpycYg/50011 WHEN MY NIECE WAS FOUR SHE RESISTED GETTING DRESSED AND REJECTED EVERYTHING
trainval/MEDgtjpycYg/50012 WHAT IF I GAVE MY DAUGHTER A CHOICE
trainval/MEDgtjpycYg/50013 THIS SHIRT OR THAT SHIRT
trainval/MEDgtjpycYg/50014 OK THAT SHIRT
trainval/MEDgtjpycYg/50015 THIS PANT OR THAT PANT
trainval/MEDgtjpycYg/50017 WELL ONE OF THE WAYS IS BE A MAMA BEAR
trainval/MEDgtjpycYg/50018 THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE TIMES IN LIFE WHEN I HAVE BEEN FOREWARNED THAT A LOW POWER PERSON
trainval/MEDgtjpycYg/50019 AND THE ANSWERS ARE ALWAYS THE SAME
trainval/MEDgtjpycYg/50020 THEY SMILED A BIG BEAMING SMILE
trainval/MEDgtjpycYg/50021 THEY SAID MY EYES LIT UP
trainval/MEDgtjpycYg/50022 I WANT TO END WITH A FEW WORDS FROM MY LATE FATHER THAT HE SPOKE AT MY TWIN BROTHER'S WEDDING
trainval/MEDgtjpycYg/50023 AND HE SAID THE LIGHTER YOUR TOUCH THE BETTER YOU BECOME AT IMPROVING AND ENRICHING YOUR
trainval/Melo1Bgporw/50001 AND I BECAME REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT THAT ABOUT BEING AN ENTREPRENEUR
trainval/MExS7F0lGzI/50001 WHY DO YOU SAY I CAN'T DO THAT
trainval/MExS7F0lGzI/50002 SO I DECIDED TO GO ON THE RIDE BECAUSE MY DAD TAUGHT ME TO ALWAYS GO ON THE SCARY RIDE
trainval/MF2Q6CcGN7E/50001 IN NORMAL LIFE YOU CAN LOSE SOME WEIGHT AND IT'S NOT A PROBLEM
trainval/MF2Q6CcGN7E/50002 YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO EAT FOR SIX HOURS AND THAT'S A LONG TIME
trainval/MF2Q6CcGN7E/50003 YOUR HORMONE INSULIN IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT HORMONES TO KEEP YOUR BODY IN A HEALTHY BALANCE
trainval/MF2Q6CcGN7E/50004 YOU PLAY THE KEY ROLE
trainval/mf5otGNbkuc/50001 THERE'S NO INHERENT MEANING IN INFORMATION
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50001 TODAY IT'S A TOWERING VOLCANO
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50002 FROM THAT DAY IT STARTED TO GROW AND BECOME WHAT WE SEE TODAY
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50003 THERE WAS A SMALL MOUND WITH A CREST
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50004 IT'S EXACTLY WHERE THE BIG VOLCANO IS SITTING TODAY
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50005 IT WAS A FRIEND THAT BETRAYED THEM
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50006 SO THAT'S THE FIRST THING
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50007 NOT A SINGLE ONE
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50008 SO THAT'S ANOTHER MYTH
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50009 WE KNOW THAT EVERYTHING HAPPENED THE 24TH TWENTY FOURTH OF AUGUST IN 79 A
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50010 BUT HOW DO WE KNOW THAT
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50011 BUT WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE PLINY THE YOUNGER WROTE THAT IN A LETTER
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50012 HE WAS A WITNESS
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50013 BUT HOW DO WE KNOW THAT
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50014 I TOLD YOU THERE WAS A LETTER
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50015 IT VANISHED IN TIME
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50016 BUT OF COURSE THEY WOULD MAKE MISTAKES
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50017 SO IS THE DATE RIGHT OR NOT
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50018 ANOTHER ONE SAYS NINE DAYS BEFORE THE CALENDS OF NOVEMBER WHICH IS THE 24TH OF
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50019 SO THAT MEANS THAT PROBABLY IT WAS A VERY COLD CLIMATE WHICH MAKES MORE
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50020 AND THEN THEY WOULD COVER AND SEAL EVERYTHING
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50021 AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS FOUND
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50022 AND THAT WOULD PROBABLY TELL YOU THAT THE DATE OF THE ERUPTION WAS AROUND THE END
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50023 SO THAT OF COURSE IS NO DEFINITE PROOF BUT THAT'S INTERESTING TO SEE THAT SUCH A KNOWN
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50024 SO MAYBE PEOPLE WOULD GO THERE
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50025 SO MANY PEOPLE ESPECIALLY ARISTOCRACY HAD GONE AWAY
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50026 YOU DIDN'T HAVE RUNNING WATER
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50027 RUNNING WATER WAS NOT THERE BECAUSE PROBABLY THE AQUEDUCT WAS BROKEN IN SOME PLACES MAYBE DUE
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50028 WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50029 AND LET'S TRY TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WOULD I HAVE SURVIVED
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50030 IF IT WAS THE 24TH OF OCTOBER IT WAS A FRIDAY
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50031 WE'VE SEEN SO MANY MOVIES READ SO MANY NOVELS TELLING US ABOUT THE BIG VOLCANO TELLING
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50033 TO OPEN CRACK OPEN IN THAT MORNING
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50035 AND THEY SAW SOMETHING WEIRD
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50036 THERE IS A STRANGE SMELL OF SULFUR JUST FROM THAT MOUNTAIN
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50037 IT WOULD REACH MORE THAN 32 KILOMETERS OF HEIGHT IN THE HOUR WHICH IS THREE TIMES
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50039 WHAT IS A LAPILLI
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50040 IT FLOATS IN THE WATER
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50041 IT'S JUST LIKE A PIECE OF CORK
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50042 IT DOESN'T REALLY KILL YOU
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50043 SO NO ONE KNEW IT WAS A VOLCANO
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50044 BUT THEY WERE NOT THE KILLERS
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50045 SO I ASKED MYSELF WHY DIDN'T THE PEOPLE GO AWAY
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50046 AND THEN SO PEOPLE JUST IMAGINE STARTED TO SEE THOSE ROCKS COMING DOWN SMOKING ROCKS
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50047 YOU COULDN'T SEE THE ROADS JUST LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE A HEAVY SNOW
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50048 YOU COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50049 SO WHERE COULD YOU GO
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50050 AND ANOTHER THING IS THAT YOU HAD LIKE A FOG COMING DOWN
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50051 AND THESE ASHES WERE CONTAINING PIECES OF GLASS ACTUALLY THAT WERE ACTUALLY
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50052 SO IT IS NORMAL TO THINK THAT PEOPLE JUST HID IN THEIR HOUSES
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50053 WHAT HAPPENED THEN
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50054 SO YOU HAD THE ROOF STARTING TO COLLAPSE
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50055 PROBABLY YOU ALSO HAD EARTHQUAKES IN THAT PROCESS
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50056 SO PEOPLE WERE IN THE HOUSES SCREAMING ASKING FOR HELP
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50057 EVERYONE WOULD GATHER THERE IN THE MORNING USUALLY JUST TO GET INFORMATION TO MEET FRIENDS
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50058 THEY ALL DIED WITHOUT DEFENDING THEMSELVES
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50059 IT WAS JUST LIKE A TV SET OF THAT TIME
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50060 YOU COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50061 THE FIRST ONE STOPS RIGHT AT THE SUBURBIA OF POMPEII
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50062 AND THEN THERE IS ANOTHER ONE THE LAST ONE THAT IS SO POWERFUL IT GOES ALL THE WAY
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50063 HE WAS STAYING AT THIRTY KILOMETERS AWAY
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50064 SO THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED EXACTLY IN POMPEII
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50065 BUT WHEN YOU FIND YOURSELF IN FRONT OF ONE OF THOSE BODIES INSIDE THE GLASS
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50066 THESE ARE NOT PETRIFIED PEOPLE
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50067 AND WE I GUESS SHOULD PAY RESPECT TO THEM EVERY TIME
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50068 LET'S GO BACK TO POMPEII
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50069 PROBABLY YOU DON'T HAVE THE RAIN OF LAPILLI ANYMORE
trainval/Mgbf3cq7lms/50070 SO THEY WANT TO GO AWAY BUT YOU HAVE SO MANY LAPILLI IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO OPEN THE DOOR
trainval/mGbMwP8MDjg/50002 SIR I'M NOT LETTING YOU SPEAK RIGHT NOW
trainval/mGbMwP8MDjg/50003 IF I BELIEVED ONE POSITIVE THING ABOUT MYSELF HOW WOULD MY LIFE BE DIFFERENT
trainval/mGbMwP8MDjg/50004 BUT IT ALSO GIVES THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE SOMETHING WITH THE COURT THAT GOES BEYOND THEIR CRIMINAL RECORD
trainval/mGbMwP8MDjg/50005 THE NEXT PRINCIPLE IS UNDERSTAND
trainval/mGbMwP8MDjg/50006 IT'S WHEN I SAY UM HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY
trainval/mGbMwP8MDjg/50007 PART TWO WAS KNOWN AS THE WORST COURTROOM IN THE CITY SOME FOLKS WOULD EVEN SAY IN THE STATE
trainval/mGbMwP8MDjg/50008 THE QUESTION WORKS EVEN WHEN IT DOESN'T
trainval/mgBsSW5CFnw/50001 SHAME IS ONE OF THE SELF CONSCIOUS FEELINGS THAT THE VERY BEST PEOPLE THAT
trainval/MgnnQ2CN6yY/50001 AM I AN AUNT
trainval/MgnnQ2CN6yY/50002 AT THE SAME TIME THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT TO ME THAN THE KIDS IN MY LIFE SO I FOUND MYSELF IN A SITUATION THAT WE
trainval/MgnnQ2CN6yY/50003 STANCE ON GAYNESS OVER HER HERITAGE
trainval/MgnnQ2CN6yY/50004 AND IF WE CAN HOLD TWO THINGS WE CAN HOLD FOUR AND IF WE CAN HOLD FOUR WE CAN HOLD EIGHT AND IF WE CAN HOLD EIGHT WE CAN HOLD HUNDREDS
trainval/mGS7sGyRjqE/50001 IT'S LIKE A CONCRETE DOUGHNUT
trainval/mGS7sGyRjqE/50002 IT'S NOT WORKING HOW I WANT IT TO WORK
trainval/mGS7sGyRjqE/50004 THERE ARE FIVE IN THE SET
trainval/mGS7sGyRjqE/50005 THIS IS A STARK CONTRAST TO THE CALM WATERY LIKE SOUND OF IMPRESSIONISM
trainval/mGS7sGyRjqE/50006 I LOVE THE JAZZ GREATS
trainval/mgSx0q6AjdI/50001 I THINK HUGE EMPHASIS ON EDUCATION
trainval/mgSx0q6AjdI/50002 THIS DOESN'T MEAN EVERYBODY NEEDS A MASTER'S WHAT THIS MEANS IS WE KNOW THAT IN SIX SHORT
trainval/mgSx0q6AjdI/50003 RIGHT NOW 48 OF OUR POPULATION MEETS THOSE REQUIREMENTS
trainval/mgSx0q6AjdI/50004 SIX YEARS SO WE KNOW WE HAVE TO BE MORE EDUCATED AND WE KNOW WE HAVE TO CHANGE HOW WE'RE DOING IN COLORADO TO
trainval/mgSx0q6AjdI/50005 EVERYBODY DOESN'T NEED A FOUR YEAR DEGREE BUT YOU'VE GOT TO GET YOURSELF TO COLLEGE
trainval/mgSx0q6AjdI/50007 WE'VE BEEN TEACHING KIDS FOR 50 TO 60 YEARS ABOUT EXACTLY THE SAME WAY AND WE KNOW IT'S NOT WORKING VERY WELL
trainval/mgSx0q6AjdI/50008 HERE'S WHAT I WOULD DISTINGUISH
trainval/mgSx0q6AjdI/50009 WE FRAME A POWER LUNCH AS WHO'S WITH YOU AND WHAT I'D SAY TO EACH OF YOU IS I THINK THERE'S A
trainval/mgSx0q6AjdI/50010 NOT GOING FOR THE THING YOU REALLY WANT BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID YOU MAY NOT GET IT
trainval/MgUTzbGakRw/50001 IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT YOU DRIVE IN TODAY YOU HAD A VEHICLE THAT HAD A COMPUTER CONTROLLED ENGINE AND COMPUTER CONTROLLED
trainval/MgUTzbGakRw/50002 SO WE ARE IN THE AGE
trainval/MgUTzbGakRw/50003 ONE IN PARTICULAR THE ONE AT THE BOTTOM IS CALLED THE SYCLONE
trainval/MgUTzbGakRw/50004 THAT WAS IN 1959
trainval/MgUTzbGakRw/50005 THERE WERE ACTUALLY 89 PARTICIPANTS 89 TEAMS THAT CAME TO PARTICIPATE THIS COMPETITION
trainval/Mh3SwYHdeVs/50001 WHAT I AM TRYING TO DO IS I'M TRYING TO BRING THOSE TWO VIEWS INTO ONE SO THAT MY IMAGES
trainval/mhJumNSd9OI/50001 HE QUESTIONED HOW I WAS GOING TO MAKE IT
trainval/mhJumNSd9OI/50002 BUT IN ACTUALITY OUR SCHOOL GOT A FAB LAB THROUGH A GRANT PROVIDED BY
trainval/mi9B40hZYAo/50001 MY IDEA WAS BORN
trainval/mi9B40hZYAo/50002 HOW DO BLIND PEOPLE READ
trainval/mi9B40hZYAo/50003 I STILL REMEMBER ONE OF THEM WITH A SMILE
trainval/mi9B40hZYAo/50004 PERFECT FOR MY JACKET
trainval/mi9B40hZYAo/50005 IT WOULD NOW TELL ME AND YOU
trainval/mi9B40hZYAo/50006 PLEASE KEEP THEM ON UNTIL I ASK YOU TO REMOVE THEM
trainval/mi9B40hZYAo/50007 HOW DO I SHAKE HANDS WITH PEOPLE WHO DO NOT SEE MY HAND COMING
trainval/mi9B40hZYAo/50008 IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE WHETHER YOU'RE BLIND OR VISUALLY IMPAIRED
trainval/mi9B40hZYAo/50009 OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT DAMAGE THE PAPER AND THE PAPER DOTS
trainval/mi9B40hZYAo/50010 FOR THE TIME BEING YOU'LL HAVE TO MAKE DUE WITH MY VOICE JUST LIKE THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED
trainval/mi9B40hZYAo/50011 THEY'RE MADE FROM PLASTIC AND YOU CAN USE THEM IN THE GARDEN
trainval/mi9B40hZYAo/50013 DURING MY STUDY IT WAS CALLED A COOKBOOK FOR THE VISUAL IMPAIRED
trainval/mi9B40hZYAo/50014 TRY IT IN A FUN WAY AND THINKING OF WHAT CAN I DO
trainval/mi9B40hZYAo/50015 THIS YEAR I'VE COMPLETED THE SEQUEL BAKING WITH FEELING
trainval/mi9B40hZYAo/50016 MY FIRST QUESTION AGAIN THOSE PLASTIC PAGES
trainval/mi9B40hZYAo/50017 AND MAYBE JUST MAYBE THIS TED TALK WILL BE A ONE LITTLE STEP IN THAT
trainval/MiOVX7qKQ24/50001 THINKING I'D ALREADY HIT ROCK BOTTOM I NOW CONTEMPLATED A LIFE AS A SOCIAL PARIAH
trainval/MiOVX7qKQ24/50002 WE HAD A HOLIDAY PLANNED THEY'D HAVE TIME TO BURY ME GRIEVE TAKE A HOLIDAY TO GET OVER IT
trainval/MiOVX7qKQ24/50003 BUT THAT WOULDN'T BE FAIR ON THE DRIVER
trainval/MiOVX7qKQ24/50004 AND WHAT IF IT DIDN'T WORK
trainval/MiOVX7qKQ24/50005 DESPITE GOVERNMENT PROMISES OF EXTRA CASH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES HAVE STRUGGLED WITH YEARS OF
trainval/MiOVX7qKQ24/50006 WHEN DEPRESSION BECOMES SEVERE SUICIDAL THOUGHTS ARE COMMON
trainval/MiPXuEFAdIc/50001 I JUST WANTED TO REMIND YOU ALL THAT YOU STILL HAVE THE HELMETS ON WHICH IS GREAT
trainval/MiPXuEFAdIc/50002 AND THE RIVER RUNS ABOUT 520KMS FROM TORNETR SK DOWN TO BOTTENVIKEN
trainval/MIRoB4LStDY/50001 BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT REALLY IS BUT IT LOOKS SO
trainval/MIRoB4LStDY/50002 AND NO WONDER
trainval/MIRoB4LStDY/50003 AND WHY WOULD I DO THAT
trainval/MIRoB4LStDY/50004 SO I DECIDED TO CREATE SOMETHING NEW
trainval/MIRoB4LStDY/50005 AND I COULDN'T HAVE PREDICTED THIS TO BECOME SO BIG AND SUCCESSFUL
trainval/MIRoB4LStDY/50007 TO BE SURPRISED WITH THOSE UNPREDICTABLE TURNAROUNDS
trainval/mj0CWrSB7E8/50001 BUT WHAT IF WE SHOOK THINGS UP A BIT
trainval/mj0CWrSB7E8/50002 WHAT IF WE CHANGED THIS ALL
trainval/mj0CWrSB7E8/50003 HER RESPONSE WAS YOU CAN'T
trainval/mj0CWrSB7E8/50004 THEY AMPLIFY EACH OTHER
trainval/mj0CWrSB7E8/50005 WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR US TO FALL IN LOVE WITH THOSE PRODUCTS THAT ARE HERE TO SERVE US
trainval/mj0CWrSB7E8/50006 IN OTHER WORDS IF THE PATIENT SIMPLY DOES NOT LIKE THE BRACE SHE WON'T WEAR THE BRACE AND IF SHE DOESN'T WEAR THE BRACE
trainval/mj0CWrSB7E8/50007 IT'S THE ONLY ONE OF ITS KIND
trainval/mj0CWrSB7E8/50008 BY HER ENGAGING IN THE PRODUCT'S CREATION THAT IS FOR HER BODY SHE WILL THEN LIKE IT
trainval/mj0CWrSB7E8/50009 SHE'S ABLE TO WALK
trainval/mj0CWrSB7E8/50010 IT RE WRITES THE WAY WE DESIGN A PRODUCT
trainval/MJKSdMlATmM/50001 THE CSF FILLS THE SPACE THAT SURROUNDS THE BRAIN AND WASTES FROM INSIDE THE BRAIN MAKE THEIR WAY
trainval/Mjl1i13JKNM/50001 BUT ONCE YOU'VE FOUND THAT MOMENT WHERE YOU'RE FLOWING AND EVERYTHING
trainval/Mjoxh4c2Dj0/50001 WELL NOW SOMEONE IS
trainval/Mjoxh4c2Dj0/50002 ECONOMICS YOU ARE A RATIONAL ACTOR SEEKING TO MAXIMIZE FINANCIAL SELF INTEREST
trainval/Mjoxh4c2Dj0/50004 ALL OF THEM AGREED ON WHAT IT WAS TO EXIST
trainval/Mjoxh4c2Dj0/50005 AND THIS STORY IS CHANGING TODAY
trainval/Mjoxh4c2Dj0/50006 PHYSICISTS HAVE DEALT WITH THAT BY BASICALLY RELEGATING IT TO THE MICRO REALM AND SAYING THE WORLD STILL WORKS
trainval/Mjoxh4c2Dj0/50007 AND HE ASKED HIS NAME
trainval/Mjoxh4c2Dj0/50008 IT'S A RELATIVELY NEW PHENOMENON
trainval/Mjoxh4c2Dj0/50009 SO WE'RE MOVING INTO A DIFFERENT STORY A DIFFERENT STORY OF SELF A DIFFERENT STORY OF THE WORLD A DIFFERENT STORY
trainval/Mjoxh4c2Dj0/50010 NOW WE MUST TRY THE IMPOSSIBLE
trainval/mjUsobGWhs8/50001 4 MILLION OTHER SPECIES ON THE PLANET
trainval/mjUsobGWhs8/50002 WE DON'T JUST ADD NUTRITION DIRECTLY TO THE SOIL
trainval/mjUsobGWhs8/50003 THAT WOULD BE THE INDUSTRIAL WAY
trainval/mjUsobGWhs8/50004 IT GOES AGAINST NATURE
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50001 CAN I CALL YOU RIGHT BACK
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50002 WOULD YOU CALL ME PLEASE RIGHT NOW
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50003 AND DON'T YOU ALL CALL ME AT THREE A
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50004 IT COULD BE ANYTHING
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50005 IT COULD BE SALSA MUSIC OR A COMEDY ROUTINE IT DOESN'T MATTER
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50006 BUT NONETHELESS IF YOU'RE A COLLEGE KID AND YOU HAVE NO MONEY BELIEVE ME THIS IS BETTER THAN TRYING TO USE YOUR
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50007 IT'D BE REALLY REALLY COOL AND YET EVEN THOUGH THE TECHNOLOGY FOR THIS HAS BEEN AVAILABLE FOR FIVE YEARS
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50008 AND IT'S SO INTERESTING THAT I THOUGHT I WOULD TELL YOU ABOUT IT
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50009 IT COMES FROM T MOBILE
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50010 AND I AM NOT PAID BY T MOBILE
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50011 I'M NOT PLUGGING T MOBILE
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50012 THE NEW YORK TIMES HAS VERY RIGID POLICIES ABOUT THAT
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50013 THE IPHONE CAME OUT THAT DAY
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50014 AND WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF THE HOTSPOT YOU'RE ON THE REGULAR CELLULAR NETWORK
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50015 YOU'RE THINKING WELL HOW OFTEN AM I IN A HOTSPOT
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50016 THEY HAVE COVERAGE LIKE THE SIZE OF MY THUMBNAIL
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50017 THEY DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50018 HOW CAN IT BE SO GOOD
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50019 THAT'S WHO CAN AFFORD TO DO THAT
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50020 THE BEAUTY OF THAT IS YOU NEVER MISS A CALL
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50021 BY THE WAY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY BOTHERS ME
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50022 I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REALIZE THIS
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50023 IT'S TOTALLY FREE THERE'S NOT EVEN ADS
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50024 NOBODY OVER 40 KNOWS HOW TO DO THAT
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50025 SO I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU SOMETHING EVEN BETTER
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50026 I WANT TO FIND WHAT
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50027 YOU WILL PAY
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50028 I GOT TWO VOICEMAIL MESSAGES
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50029 ANYWAY BUT THIS TEACHES PEOPLE WHAT IT'S LIKE
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50030 ONE WAS FROM A GUY NAMED MICHAEL STEVENSON WHICH SHOULDN'T BE THAT HARD TO TRANSCRIBE AND IT WAS MISSPELLED
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50031 THIS IS MY FAVORITE OF ALL TIME
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50032 NAILED THAT ONE
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50033 I KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED ON THE TREO
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50034 FINALLY CINGULAR SAID OK
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50035 I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE EFFECT OF THE IPHONE
trainval/mJxA8eIWQUc/50036 AND THEY SAID OH MY GOSH MAYBE WE'VE BEEN DOING IT WRONG
trainval/mk3KSVrveSE/50001 AND I STARTED TO CRY
trainval/mk3KSVrveSE/50002 BUT JUST UNPACK YOUR SUITCASE
trainval/mk3KSVrveSE/50003 THEY CAME AROUND A CORNER FACED WITH A ROW OF MACHINE GUNS
trainval/mk3KSVrveSE/50004 THE FEAR IS THE CHILD
trainval/mk3KSVrveSE/50005 IT'S PEOPLE JOINING UP WITH PEOPLE AS BUNDY JUST SAID MILES AWAY
trainval/mk3KSVrveSE/50006 IT'S FLOWN AROUND THE WORLD
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50001 AND I HAVE TWO PEOPLE WITH US TO HELP US DO THAT
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50002 THEY'RE NOT GOING TO COME AT THIS HAMMER AND TONG AGAINST EACH OTHER
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50003 THIS IS NOT LIKE CABLE NEWS
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50004 THEY'VE IMMERSED THEMSELVES IN CONSERVATIVE WORLDVIEWS IF YOU LIKE
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50005 THEY KNOW THAT SPACE VERY WELL
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50006 SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO A HUGE WELCOME TO GRETCHEN AND DAVID
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50007 IT DIDN'T JUST HAPPEN OVERNIGHT
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50008 I HAVE TO THROW IN THERE ALSO CELEBRITY
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50009 THAT PHRASE RUNG IN MY HEAD WORD PEOPLE
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50010 AND SO THAT ACCUMULATION OF THINGS AND WHEN I TALKED TO TRUMP VOTERS AND STILL DO I FOUND MOST OF THEM COMPLETELY REALISTIC
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50011 AND I WOULD SAY NO IT'S NOT
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50012 ACTUALLY MAYBE THEY'RE SUPPORTING HIM DESPITE THOSE BECAUSE THEY SEE SOMETHING EXCITING
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50013 THEY SEE A MAN OF ACTION
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50014 ON THE OTHER SIDE ARE THOSE WHO FEEL THE HEADWINDS OF GLOBALIZATION AND THE MERITOCRACY JUST BLASTING IN THEIR FACES
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50015 THERE ARE THE FOREIGN POLICIES HAWKS WHO BELIEVE IN AMERICA AS GLOBAL POLICEMAN
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50016 AND THERE'S A WHOLE WORLDVIEW THERE IT'S A VERY COHERENT WORLDVIEW
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50017 I SORT OF HAVE MORE RESPECT FOR HIM
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50018 I LOATHE WHAT HE STANDS FOR AND I THINK HE'S WRONG ON THE SUBSTANCE BUT IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE SOMEONE WITH A SET OF
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50019 ARE THESE TWO THINGS IMPLACABLY OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50020 BUT THEN IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT A LOT OF HIS ECONOMIC POLICIES LIKE HEALTH CARE REFORM WHICH IS ABOUT PRIVATE HEALTH CARE
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50021 DEREGULATION THAT'S RISK
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50022 THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT HIM ON EVIDENCE SO FAR ARE PROBABLY PRETTY EXCITED
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50023 AND THAT IS NOT TRADITIONALLY THE AMERICAN IDENTITY
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50024 IT'S JUST THAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50025 SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO FIGHT
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50026 IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE I WAS LOOKING IN THE AUDIENCE TRYING TO SEE DEMOCRATIC WOMEN WHO DIDN'T WEAR WHITE
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50027 THAT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE TOO PERSUASIVE TO YOU
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50028 ONE THE PHRASE FLYOVER COUNTRY
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50029 AND THAT'S BEEN HEARD FOR YEARS BUT I WOULD SAY THIS YEAR I HEARD IT ALMOST ON AN HOURLY BASIS A SENSE OF
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50030 AND LISTEN I'VE WRITTEN EIGHT MILLION ANTI TRUMP COLUMNS BUT IT IS A PROBLEM ESPECIALLY FOR THE COASTAL MEDIA THAT EVERY
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50031 THE TRUTH IS THAT 87 PERCENT OF THE JOBS WERE REPLACED BY TECHNOLOGY
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50032 IF I'M GOING TO WATCH A SITCOM OR A LATE NIGHT COMEDY SHOW IT'S GOING TO BE LIBERAL
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50033 READ A COLUMN THAT IS NOT SOMETHING YOU WOULD NORMALLY READ BECAUSE THEN YOU GAIN PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT THE OTHER SIDE
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50034 I MAY GET THIS A LITTLE WRONG BUT I THINK OF THE TOP SELLING AUTOMOTIVE MODELS IN THIS COUNTRY I THINK THE TOP
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50035 AND THAT'S SORT OF A WARNING SIGN KIND OF A PROBLEM
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50036 IF YOU GET YOUR FEELINGS HURT WELL WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF EDUCATION
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50037 I WAS TOLD THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50038 AND SO IF I'M GOING TO TELL PEOPLE THAT THEY SHOULD TAKE RISKS ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE SEEING IS A
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50039 SO HOW DO WE GIVE PEOPLE THE SECURITY FROM WHICH THEY CAN TAKE RISK
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50040 AND AS A SOCIETY WE DO NOT HAVE A SECURE BASE AND WE WON'T GET TO THAT HAMILTON RISK TAKING ENERGETIC
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50041 IS HE GOING TO DO THAT
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50042 I HAVE NO IDEA
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50043 THEY'RE NOT GOOD FOR TODAY
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50044 I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO WORK
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50045 I THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE A DYNAMIC ECONOMY THAT CREATES GROWTH
trainval/mkdSXHXhCcw/50046 THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT AMERICA
trainval/mKe3QKctaS8/50001 IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR OUR MUSIC AND OUR LANGUAGE
trainval/mKkF6mAlX4k/50001 AND ONLY 48 HOURS LATER WE GOT THE PERMISSION TO GO HOME
trainval/mKkF6mAlX4k/50002 WE BRING A ONE POUND BABY TO GROW INTO A 100 POUND PERSON
trainval/mKkF6mAlX4k/50003 IT'S REALLY AMAZING
trainval/mKkF6mAlX4k/50004 AND WHAT ARE OUR BASICS
trainval/mKkF6mAlX4k/50005 THEY ARE SO SMALL
trainval/mKkF6mAlX4k/50007 AND WHEN PRE TERMS ARE BEING TOUCHED IT IMPROVES THEIR WEIGHT GAIN
trainval/mKkF6mAlX4k/50008 AND I THINK IT'S THE ONLY TIME IN OUR LIFE WE ARE VERY HAPPY GAINING WEIGHT
trainval/mKkF6mAlX4k/50009 THEY SPEND WEEKS AND MONTHS IN OUR DEPARTMENT
trainval/mKkF6mAlX4k/50010 AND IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME
trainval/mKkF6mAlX4k/50011 MY FIRST ARE TWIN BOYS
trainval/mKkF6mAlX4k/50012 SO WE TEXT THEM AN SMS UPDATE
trainval/mKkF6mAlX4k/50013 THEY FELT THAT WE ARE AVAILABLE
trainval/mKkF6mAlX4k/50015 IT'S TOO PAINFUL
trainval/mKkF6mAlX4k/50016 AND IT WAS VERY EMOTIONAL FOR BOTH OF US
trainval/mKkF6mAlX4k/50017 WE NEED TO GO BACK TO THE CONTACT CONNECTION AND COMPASSION
trainval/mKkF6mAlX4k/50018 ASK YOURSELF EVERY DAY
trainval/MKKGS38vCO8/50001 SO FOR MOST OF US THAT'S WHAT WE THINK OF WHEN WE HEAR THE WORD IMAGINATION
trainval/MKKGS38vCO8/50002 AND IT'S NOT JUST A CHILDISH EXPRESSION
trainval/MKKGS38vCO8/50003 NEITHER THE CONCEPT OF WRITING DOWN THINGS AND PASSING IT ON FOR OTHER PEOPLE AND SPREADING INFORMATION
trainval/MKKGS38vCO8/50004 WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO IMAGINE WHAT THAT SOLUTION IS AND USE OUR IMAGINATION TO HELP BRING IT TO
trainval/MKKGS38vCO8/50005 THEY HAVE A VERY TOUGH TIME DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN REALITY AND THEIR IMAGINATION
trainval/MKKGS38vCO8/50006 SIMILAR TO HOW YOUNG KIDS HAVE ISSUES DOING THAT BUT THEY SORT IT OUT AS THEY GROW AND
trainval/MKKGS38vCO8/50007 THERE'S MUCH MORE ABOUT HOW IT APPLIES TO YOU
trainval/MKKGS38vCO8/50008 AND THEY HAD THEM DO A FREE RECALL MEMORY TEST
trainval/MKKGS38vCO8/50009 AND WITHOUT THAT IT'S HARD TO BE ABLE TO DEFINE YOURSELF
trainval/mKPmlliPL0U/50001 SHE MULTIPLIES HERSELF
trainval/mKPmlliPL0U/50002 AND WHAT IS YOUR POWER
trainval/mKPmlliPL0U/50003 PLEASE TELL ME
trainval/mKPmlliPL0U/50004 WELCOME TO AFROTOPIA
trainval/mKPmlliPL0U/50005 ALL ARE INVITED
trainval/MkRJG510CKo/50001 WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENT
trainval/MLKj1puoWCg/50001 IT IS DEPENDENT ON THE PHYSICAL HEALTH OF YOUR BRAIN
trainval/MLKj1puoWCg/50002 BECOME VERY SERIOUS ABOUT WHO YOU SPEND YOUR TIME WITH
trainval/MLKj1puoWCg/50003 NEW LEARNING SO TED IS PERFECT FOR THIS
trainval/MLKj1puoWCg/50004 DIET IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL
trainval/MLKj1puoWCg/50005 WITHOUT THERE BEING VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES
trainval/MLKj1puoWCg/50006 WHEN PEOPLE MEDITATE IT ACTIVATES THE FRONT PART OF THEIR BRAIN WHICH IS THE MOST HUMAN
trainval/MLKj1puoWCg/50007 IT'S NOT PROZAC IT'S GRATITUDE
trainval/MLKj1puoWCg/50008 YOU WRITE DOWN THREE THINGS YOU'RE GRATEFUL FOR EVERY DAY
trainval/MLKj1puoWCg/50010 AND AS SLEEP GOES DOWN WEIGHT GOES UP BECAUSE YOUR CRAVINGS GET OUT OF CONTROL
trainval/MLKj1puoWCg/50011 I GOT DRUNK WHEN I WAS 16 I HAD A HANGOVER FOR FIVE DAYS
trainval/MLKj1puoWCg/50012 THAT'S THE COOL THING ABOUT THE BRAIN
trainval/MLKj1puoWCg/50013 BECAUSE YOU'RE MAKING BETTER DECISIONS
trainval/mlrB6npbwVQ/50001 LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN PLAYING
trainval/mlrB6npbwVQ/50002 AM I GOING TO GET WET
trainval/mlrB6npbwVQ/50003 NO I DIDN'T GET WET
trainval/mlrB6npbwVQ/50004 AM I GOING TO GET WET
trainval/mlrB6npbwVQ/50005 AM I GOING TO GET WET
trainval/mlrB6npbwVQ/50006 SO ARE YOU A MAKER
trainval/mlrB6npbwVQ/50007 WE CREATE THINGS
trainval/mlrB6npbwVQ/50008 AND THAT'S WHY HE MOVED TO MICHIGAN
trainval/Mlt6kaNjoeI/50001 INSTEAD GET RID OF THE SCHOOL BELL
trainval/Mlt6kaNjoeI/50002 HOW WILL FINANCE DEVELOPMENT
trainval/Mlt6kaNjoeI/50003 HOW WILL WE SELL DESIGN SERVICES
trainval/Mlt6kaNjoeI/50004 IT STRIKES ME THAT WE TALK VERY DEEPLY ABOUT DESIGN BUT ACTUALLY THERE'S AN ECONOMICS BEHIND ARCHITECTURE THAT WE
trainval/Mlt6kaNjoeI/50005 WHICH IS APPROPRIATE BECAUSE ACTUALLY THIS APPROACH IS NOT INNOVATIVE
trainval/Mlt6kaNjoeI/50006 AND ONCE SOMETHING'S IN THE COMMONS IT WILL ALWAYS BE THERE
trainval/MLU7qcMYKO8/50001 AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE WATER PROTECTED THE BASIN FROM BEING IMPACTED BY ASTEROIDS AND
trainval/mLufqwmPl1A/50001 NOW I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO DO MY UNDERGRAD AND POSTGRAD EDUCATION IN THE UK AND THE US IN
trainval/mLufqwmPl1A/50002 SO I KIND OF HAD TO CHANGE HATS AND BECAME QUITE ENTREPRENEURIAL AND STARTED LOOKING FOR MONEY TO BUY THE
trainval/mLufqwmPl1A/50003 AND IMMEDIATELY WE HAD WONDERFUL RESULTS
trainval/mLufqwmPl1A/50004 SO THIS WAS DESIGNED BY MY HEAD OF ENGINEERING
trainval/mLufqwmPl1A/50005 IT MEANS THAT BECAUSE OF MASSIVE INTERCONNECTIVITY AND THE AVAILABILITY OF ARTIFICIAL
trainval/mLufqwmPl1A/50006 SO SOMEBODY MAKING A GATE FOR EXAMPLE OUT OF METAL MAY TAKE A WEEK TO MAKE JUST ONE GATE BUT WITH THIS MACHINE THEY MIGHT
trainval/mLufqwmPl1A/50007 SO THE SIGNIFICANCE HERE IS THAT THE PILOTING PROCESS IS POSSIBLE
trainval/mLufqwmPl1A/50008 SHE'S NOT AN ENGINEER
trainval/mLufqwmPl1A/50009 SHE WAS ABLE TO ENGAGE PEOPLE IN OUR SPACE TO BE ABLE TO HELP HER TO DO THIS AND SHE'S OFF AND RUNNING NOW WITH A BUSINESS
trainval/mLufqwmPl1A/50010 WE HAVE LOTS OF DISCUSSIONS IN OUR SPACE AROUND WHO WE WERE AS AFRICANS WHO WE ARE TODAY AND WHO WE WANT TO BE VIS VIS THINGS LIKE
trainval/mLufqwmPl1A/50011 SO IN KENYA RIGHT NOW WE HAVE VOLKSWAGEN PEUGEOT RENAULT WE HAVE MERCEDES DOING LORRIES AND WE'VE ALSO GOT
trainval/MLvwTlbj1Y8/50001 WE TALK WITH OUR HANDS
trainval/MLvwTlbj1Y8/50002 YOU OPEN IT THESE MUSCLES CONTRACT
trainval/MLvwTlbj1Y8/50003 HE ALSO REQUIRED A REVISION SURGERY ON HIS CHEST
trainval/MLvwTlbj1Y8/50004 AND YOU'VE GOT ONE OF THESE CONVENTIONAL ARMS
trainval/MLvwTlbj1Y8/50005 I COULD WORK THEM JUST BY MY THOUGHTS
trainval/MLvwTlbj1Y8/50006 HE FEELS LIGHT TOUCH DOWN TO ONE GRAM OF FORCE
trainval/MLvwTlbj1Y8/50007 CAN WE GET MORE OUT OF IT
trainval/MLyguFQR5N4/50001 IT MIGHT BE A SHARED BELIEF IT MIGHT EVEN BE A SHARED EXPERIENCE
trainval/MLyguFQR5N4/50002 FIRST IT MULTIPLIES THE STORY ITSELF
trainval/MLyguFQR5N4/50003 YOU MIGHT BE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT EFFECT
trainval/MLyguFQR5N4/50004 YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THIS
trainval/MLyguFQR5N4/50005 A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS THAT YOU SEE A LOT IN THAT DATA IS THE HASHTAG FOR DIRECTIONERS
trainval/MLyguFQR5N4/50006 IT'S THE FORMER BOY BAND ONE DIRECTION
trainval/MLyguFQR5N4/50007 MAYBE YOU'VE DONE IT AS WELL
trainval/MLyguFQR5N4/50008 FOR EXAMPLE THAT THEY WERE JUST OFF TO REHEARSE
trainval/MLyguFQR5N4/50009 THINK ABOUT IT
trainval/MLyguFQR5N4/50010 THEY WERE TELLING REALLY FUNNY STORIES
trainval/MLyguFQR5N4/50011 IT CAN HELP US TO BUILD BRIDGES
trainval/MLyguFQR5N4/50012 ARE YOU INFLATING A BUBBLE OR ARE YOU BUILDING A BRIDGE
trainval/MLyguFQR5N4/50013 PERHAPS THEN WE MIGHT FIND THE SAME THING THAT JO COX OBSERVED IN
trainval/MLyguFQR5N4/50014 THAT WE HAVE FAR MORE IN COMMON THAN THE THINGS THAT DIVIDE US
trainval/MLZubXfClL4/50001 WHEN WE ARE NOT TEACHING OUR STUDENTS ABOUT SAME SEX RELATIONSHIPS WE WERE FAILING TO MAKE SCHOOL A MORE
trainval/MLZubXfClL4/50002 SO HOW IS THIS AFFECTING THEM
trainval/MLZubXfClL4/50003 NOT ONLY ARE WE FAILING TO EDUCATE QUEER TEENAGERS WE ARE PUTTING THEM IN DANGER BY SENDING THEM INTO A WORLD WITHOUT PROPER TOOLS
trainval/MLZubXfClL4/50004 DOES THIS WORK FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVING SEX WHO ARE THE SAME BODY TYPE
trainval/MLZubXfClL4/50005 BRING UP THE CONVERSATION TALK ABOUT IT
trainval/MLZubXfClL4/50006 WHY AREN'T WE TALKING ABOUT THIS
trainval/MLZubXfClL4/50007 AS CITIZENS WE CAN TALK TO OUR SENATORS
trainval/MLZubXfClL4/50008 THERE'S A RISK THAT COMES WITH ANY KIND OF SUPPORT FOR THE LGBT MOVEMENT
trainval/MLZubXfClL4/50009 THESE ARE THE KINDS OF RISKS THAT COME WITH ANY KIND OF ALLYSHIP
trainval/MLZubXfClL4/50010 BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT ALLIES PUSH BACK THESE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THEM AND CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE LGBT
trainval/mMasmrJOmEo/50001 TIME AND TIME AGAIN RANDOM STRANGERS WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY TO HELP US OUT OR
trainval/mMasmrJOmEo/50002 EVERY HOTEL IN THE CITY IS EXACTLY THE SAME
trainval/mMasmrJOmEo/50003 IT'S UP TO US TO START THE PROCESS
trainval/mMasmrJOmEo/50004 BUT HERE'S THE CATCH
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50001 ON THE RIGHT ARE THE CORRESPONDING PATTERNS OF THE BRAIN ACTIVITY
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50002 BUT WHAT IS SHE SURPRISED ABOUT
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50003 WHAT IS SHE LOOKING AT
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50004 WHAT IS SHE HEARING
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50005 WE CAN'T TELL THIS FROM THE SURFACE OF THE BODY FROM THE BODY LANGUAGE OR FROM FACE WE SOMEHOW NEED TO
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50007 SO HOW CAN WE READ THESE OUT
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50008 I'D LIKE YOU TO THINK ONE OF YOUR SECRETS
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50009 FOR THIS WE USE SO CALLED BRAIN SCANNERS
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50010 SO THAT'S WHAT WE DO
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50011 IT DOESN'T SAY ON THERE THIS PERSON IS THINKING ABOUT THE BRANDENBURG GATE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50012 BUT INSTEAD OTHERS MIGHT HAVE SAID I THINK IT ACTUALLY MEANS SOMETHING
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50013 BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50014 WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS MEANS
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50015 IT'S A VERY SIMILAR PROBLEM
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50016 WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50017 LIKE THE BRAIN IMAGE YOU CAN'T KNOW
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50018 BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50019 HOW DO I KNOW THIS
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50020 IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE STUMBLED ON THE TRANSLATION
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50021 THIS NOW MAKES THE TASK VERY SIMPLE
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50022 ALL WE NEED TO DO IS TO FIND THE ROSETTA STONE FOR THE BRAIN RIGHT
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50023 WHERE IS IT
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50024 WHERE DO WE HAVE TO GO AND DIG
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50025 DO WE HAVE TO GO AND DIG IN NORTH AFRICA OR SOUTHEAST ASIA
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50026 WHERE IS THE ROSETTA STONE FOR THE BRAIN GOING TO BE
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50027 WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE THOUGHTS ARE A PERSON HAS
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50028 HOW DOES THIS WORK IN DETAIL
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50029 THIS WORKS INCREDIBLY WELL AS WELL
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50030 BUT YOU COULD SAY THIS IS STILL RATHER ACADEMIC
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50031 LET'S LOOK FOR SOMETHING EVEN MORE INTERESTING
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50032 WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOR THEIR DECISIONS THINGS THAT ARE RELEVANT
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50033 BUT THIS SAYS IT'S QUITE DIFFERENT
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50034 I'LL EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50035 BUT YOU COULD SAY IF SOMEONE'S IN A BRAIN SCANNER LOOKING AT AN IMAGE I JUST HAVE TO LOOK AT THE IMAGE THEY'RE LOOKING AT AND I'LL KNOW WHAT
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50036 SO WE CAN'T TRAIN OUR MACHINE ON ONE PERSON AND USE IT FOR ANOTHER PERSON
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50037 IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WELL ON THE SECOND PERSON
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50038 IS THAT HOW WE MEASURE THE BRAIN ACTIVITY PATTERNS FOR ALL THESE THOUGHTS THEY MIGHT HAVE
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50039 WHAT COULD THAT BE
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50040 DOES THAT MEAN NOW YOU OPEN TO MANIPULATION
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50041 NOW THERE ARE A NUMBER OF TECHNICAL ISSUES ENSUING FROM THIS
trainval/mMDuakmEEV4/50042 FOR EXAMPLE POTENTIAL LIE DETECTORS OR BRAIN MARKETING LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN
trainval/mmhedbY8wjU/50001 IN THE NEXT MOMENT I RECOGNIZED THAT THIS THIRD GRADER WAS FROM A SPANISH SPEAKING FAMILY
trainval/mmhedbY8wjU/50002 REFERENTS IN REFERENCE TO USING PRONOUNS BUT FOR NOW HER INVENTION WAS
trainval/mmhedbY8wjU/50003 DID IT HURT
trainval/mmhedbY8wjU/50004 EVERYTHING IS CONTEXT
trainval/mMYhgTgE6MU/50001 THE FOURTH STAGE MEANS
trainval/MnT1xgZgkpk/50001 A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE DID A SURVEY OF SOME OF THE WORLD'S LEADING A
trainval/MnT1xgZgkpk/50002 BUT EVEN A PRESENT DAY TRANSISTOR OPERATES AT THE GIGAHERTZ
trainval/MnT1xgZgkpk/50003 COULDN'T FIND A BUG
trainval/MO0LSLY2hRA/50001 ONLY RECENTLY HAVE I FIGURED OUT HOW TO USE THIS IN MY OWN WORK
trainval/MO0LSLY2hRA/50002 I DO THIS THOUGH PAINTING SCULPTURE VIDEO AND PERFORMANCE
trainval/MO0LSLY2hRA/50003 I SHOWED HIM A PHOTO OF A LYNCHING POSTCARD FROM THE EARLY 1900S AND REMINDED HIM THAT THESE KILLINGS HAVE BEEN GOING
trainval/Mo2Ai7ESNL8/50001 ONE FRUSTRATED JOURNALIST COULD NOT TAKE THIS ANYMORE
trainval/Mo2Ai7ESNL8/50002 HE PURCHASED HIS OWN PLANE TICKET AND WENT TO THE VILLAGE WHERE THIS HAD OCCURRED
trainval/Mo2Ai7ESNL8/50003 EDITORS SAT IN THEIR NEWSROOMS AND WAITED FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO TELL THEM WHAT TO DO
trainval/Mo2Ai7ESNL8/50004 TO BE SURE GOVERNMENTS HAVE DIFFERENT RESOURCES TO BRING TO THE TABLE
trainval/Mo2Ai7ESNL8/50005 AND LIKE ALL SUCH STORIES THIS IS NOT A STORY JUST OF TECHNOLOGY
trainval/Mo2Ai7ESNL8/50007 THEY WERE FRUSTRATED AND THEY HAD ACHIEVED MUCH LESS THAN WHAT THEY HAD HOPED FOR
trainval/MOFdlEbu15g/50001 DESPITE THIS FANTASTICAL 1000
trainval/MOFdlEbu15g/50002 THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH OTHER NATURAL RESOURCES AND IF WE TRIED TO MOVE TOO FAR IN THAT DIRECTION IT WOULD BE AN
trainval/MOFdlEbu15g/50003 AND THEN WE CAN FILL MARS WITH FORESTS AND LAKES AND STREAMS WITH FISH AND THERE WOULD BE BIRDS IN THE SKY
trainval/MOFdlEbu15g/50004 WE CAN ALSO SEND ROBOTIC CONSTRUCTION CREWS TO EVERY ONE OUT OF THE HUNDREDS OF MOONS AND PLANETS IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
trainval/MOFdlEbu15g/50005 CLARKE SAID FAMOUSLY ANY SUFFICIENTLY ADVANCED CIVILIZATION IS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM
trainval/MOFdlEbu15g/50006 I WASN'T ALWAYS THIS ENTHUSIASTIC ALTHOUGH I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A STRONG BELIEVER IN SPACE
trainval/MOFdlEbu15g/50007 THEY WOULD BE TALKING EXCITEDLY ABOUT SOME MEASUREMENT THEY WERE MAKING IN A STAR FAR ACROSS THE GALAXY
trainval/MOFdlEbu15g/50008 IT TURNS OUT THIS WAS IMPORTANT FOR THE HAWAIIANS FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS
trainval/MOFdlEbu15g/50009 I HAD READ THE STORIES HOW THE HAWAIIANS ORIGINALLY FOUND HAWAII
trainval/MOFdlEbu15g/50010 THEY CAME FROM TAHITI OVER 2500 MILES AWAY IN DUGOUT CANOES ACROSS OPEN
trainval/MOFdlEbu15g/50011 THAT IS NOT IN THE REALM OF THE POSSIBLE
trainval/MOFdlEbu15g/50012 EVERY DAY ON THIS HIKE THINKING ABOUT THESE THINGS AND CONTRASTING THEM I BEGAN TO REALIZE
trainval/MOFdlEbu15g/50013 WE ARE NOT SIMPLY CREATING TECHNOLOGIES TO MAKE A MARS MISSION MORE AFFORDABLE
trainval/MOFdlEbu15g/50014 WHAT WE'RE DOING IS CREATING THE FIRST GENERATION OF A NEW LIFE FORM A TYPE OF
trainval/MOFdlEbu15g/50015 WE'RE CREATING THIS MACHINE LIFE FORM THIS ROBOTIC ECOSPHERE THIS ROBOTOSPHERE
trainval/MOFdlEbu15g/50016 YOU MIGHT HAVE GUESSED I DON'T BELIEVE THAT ANYMORE AND HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED THAT CHANGED MY PERSPECTIVE
trainval/MOFdlEbu15g/50017 I WANT TO PROMISE YOU THIS IS NOT SCIENCE FICTION THIS IS SCIENCE FACT
trainval/MOFdlEbu15g/50018 WE ARE DOING THIS TODAY
trainval/MOFdlEbu15g/50019 IN 2011 I PULLED TOGETHER A FEW OF MY COLLABORATORS TO ASK THE QUESTION
trainval/MOFdlEbu15g/50020 HOW RAPIDLY CAN WE STAND UP A ROBOTOSPHERE IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
trainval/MOFdlEbu15g/50021 AND HOW MUCH WILL IT COST
trainval/MOFdlEbu15g/50022 ACCORDING TO OUR ESTIMATES WE CAN GET THIS ACCOMPLISHED IN 20 YEARS FOR AN ANNUAL COST OF
trainval/MOFdlEbu15g/50023 04 PERCENT OF THE US FEDERAL BUDGET
trainval/MOFdlEbu15g/50025 DID YOU KNOW THAT A SIMPLE ROCK IS 50 OXYGEN BY WEIGHT
trainval/MOFdlEbu15g/50026 THAT S THE POINT WHERE THE VISION I DESCRIBED AT THE START OF THIS TALK HAS BECOME THE NEW REALITY FOR HUMAN
trainval/MOFdlEbu15g/50027 YOUR GRANDCHILDREN CAN GROW UP IN A WORLD THAT IS SO ALIVE IT'LL MAKE OUR PRESENT ERA
trainval/MOFdlEbu15g/50028 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LETTING ME SHARE THIS ENTHUSIASM WITH YOU TODAY
trainval/MOptnpjKJOM/50001 AND THAT PERSON HAS TO HAVE AN ARMY
trainval/MOptnpjKJOM/50002 AVERAGE DEPTH IS ABOUT TWO MILES
trainval/MOptnpjKJOM/50003 THE FLOOR OF THE OCEAN
trainval/MOptnpjKJOM/50004 THAT'S BAD ENOUGH
trainval/MOptnpjKJOM/50005 THAT'S ALL THE FRESH WATER ON THE EARTH
trainval/moS9iMlmsP0/50001 THIS IS THE TERM THAT ARMIES USE WHEN THEY'VE LOST A BATTLE
trainval/moS9iMlmsP0/50002 THIS IS ACTUALLY A BRAINWAVE SENSOR THAT'S READING THE ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY OF MY BRAIN AS I GIVE THIS TALK
trainval/MoSmgcxGYYE/50001 SHE ASKS CAN WE GO PICK UP MADDIE FROM JASON'S HOUSE
trainval/MoSmgcxGYYE/50002 NOW MY SISTER LIKES TO THROW PARTIES LIKE ANY OTHER TEENAGER DOES
trainval/MoSmgcxGYYE/50003 I JUST GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL AND I'M RIDING THE EUPHORIA OF ALL THAT COMES ALONG WITH GOING AWAY TO COLLEGE
trainval/MoSmgcxGYYE/50004 HE IS THE ONE THAT EVERYONE LOOKS TO TO SEE WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING AND IF THEY LIKE IT OR NOT
trainval/MoSmgcxGYYE/50005 USUALLY I JUST CHAUFFEUR FOR MY SISTER FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE
trainval/MoSmgcxGYYE/50006 NOW MOST STORIES START OFF WITH
trainval/MoSmgcxGYYE/50007 AND I NOTICE THAT MADDIE'S SITTING ON THE PORCH WHICH IS OUT OF PLACE
trainval/MoSmgcxGYYE/50008 MY FIRST THOUGHT IS TO GET THE GIRLS AWAY
trainval/MoSmgcxGYYE/50009 THE OPERATOR PICKS UP AND I HAVE TO UTTER THE WORDS
trainval/MoSmgcxGYYE/50010 AND I'M ALL ALONE
trainval/MoSmgcxGYYE/50011 I DECIDE TO NOT GO TO MY FAVORITE MUSEUM WITH MY FAMILY
trainval/MoSmgcxGYYE/50012 I WAS MILKING IT
trainval/MoSmgcxGYYE/50013 NOW IF THERE'S A TIGER IN FRONT OF YOU YOU'RE REALLY NOT GOING TO BENEFIT THAT MUCH FROM THINKING
trainval/MoSmgcxGYYE/50014 AND THAT'S WHAT THE AMYGDALA TRIGGERS
trainval/MoSmgcxGYYE/50015 IT ISN'T ALWAYS COME ACROSS EXACTLY IN YOUR DREAMS
trainval/MoSmgcxGYYE/50016 WHAT EMDR DOES IS IT REALLY FORCES YOU TO BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND THINKING
trainval/MoSmgcxGYYE/50017 I'M REALLY INTO KNOWING WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMING FROM IN THEIR THOUGHTS ACTIONS AND WORDS
trainval/MoSmgcxGYYE/50018 AND I SUBJECT MYSELF TO THE SAME ANALYSIS
trainval/MoSmgcxGYYE/50019 AND JUST REMEMBER THAT SOMETIMES IT NEEDS A LITTLE HELP
trainval/mozxTk3Brqw/50002 SEVERAL HOURS LATER OVER EASTERN UKRAINE IT WAS SHOT DOWN
trainval/mozxTk3Brqw/50003 193 DUTCH CITIZENS DIED ON THAT PLANE
trainval/mozxTk3Brqw/50004 SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE KNOWN THEM
trainval/mozxTk3Brqw/50005 SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE KNOWN PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THE TRAGEDY
trainval/mozxTk3Brqw/50006 THERE WAS A VAST AMOUNT OF INFORMATION BEING SHARED ONLINE
trainval/mozxTk3Brqw/50007 SOME OF IT WAS HIDDEN SOME OF IT WAS QUITE EASY TO FIND
trainval/mozxTk3Brqw/50008 WE PUT IN THE NAME OF THE SHOP
trainval/mozxTk3Brqw/50009 THE FIRST RESULT WAS ACTUALLY A WIKI SOMEONE HAD CREATED WITH EVERY STREET OF EVERY TOWN IN EASTERN UKRAINE WITH
trainval/mozxTk3Brqw/50010 WE SEARCHED FOR THAT ADDRESS AND CAME UP WITH SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING
trainval/mozxTk3Brqw/50011 THIS WAS TAKEN AROUND MIDDAY ON JULY 17TH 2014
trainval/mozxTk3Brqw/50012 IN FACT ON JULY 21ST 2014 THEY GAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE WHERE THEY PRESENTED THEIR OWN EVIDENCE OF WHAT
trainval/mozxTk3Brqw/50013 WE COULD TRACK THIS CONVOY BACK TO THE BASE IT CAME FROM THE 53RD AIR DEFENSE BRIGADE
trainval/mozxTk3Brqw/50014 WHEN THE JOINT INVESTIGATION TEAM INTERVIEWED ME AS A WITNESS TO ASK ABOUT THE WORK WE WERE DOING I
trainval/mp0SQQQgv7s/50001 AND I WONDER IF WE CAN MAP REASONABLY A POPULATION'S EFFORTS AT THE THOUGHT
trainval/mp0SQQQgv7s/50002 WE ARE ALSO FINDING THAT LEARNING MAY ACTUALLY BE A CAUSE TO CURE DEPRESSION
trainval/mp0SQQQgv7s/50003 I DON'T JUST MEAN WHAT CODE WE'RE USING TO WRITE TO
trainval/mp0SQQQgv7s/50004 YOU SEE ELEMENTS OF PERSONALITY
trainval/mp0SQQQgv7s/50005 WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SOCIAL LEARNING NOW
trainval/mp0SQQQgv7s/50006 CREATING ARTIFACTS FOR EACH OTHER TO HELP EACH OTHER LEARN
trainval/mp0SQQQgv7s/50007 THERE ARE ELEMENTS OF LEARNING THAT WE LOSE ALONG THE WAY
trainval/mp0SQQQgv7s/50008 I CAN'T SIT STILL FOR SIX HOURS AND DO ANY ONE THING ANYMORE
trainval/mp0SQQQgv7s/50009 ULTIMATELY IF WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO ACHIEVE THEIR OWN VALUE TO GET REFERENDUMS THROUGH
trainval/mp0SQQQgv7s/50010 THIS IS NOT AN EDUCATIONAL QUESTION
trainval/mPCDOij0bB0/50001 AND ONE PLACE IN PARTICULAR
trainval/mPCDOij0bB0/50002 A COLD PLACE THE COLDEST PLACE THE ARCTIC OCEAN
trainval/mPCDOij0bB0/50003 IT'S A PLACE THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE REALLY UNDERSTAND
trainval/mPCDOij0bB0/50004 I HAVE A SIMPLE PHILOSOPHY IN TERMS OF PLANNING AND PREPARING FOR MY EXPEDITIONS AND IT'S CALLED TRAIN HARD AND TRAVEL
trainval/mPCDOij0bB0/50005 AFRAID OF BEING A FAILURE
trainval/mPCDOij0bB0/50006 AND AFRAID OF DYING
trainval/mPCDOij0bB0/50007 WE HAD A VERY CLOSE ENCOUNTER WITH TWO POLAR BEARS EARLY ON IN THE EXPEDITION AS WELL
trainval/mPCDOij0bB0/50008 BUT IT CAN BE DIFFICULT WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH THESE VERY TOUGH CONDITIONS PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY STRESSED TO MAKE A
trainval/mPCDOij0bB0/50009 IT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE WHERE PASSION COMES FROM BUT THE GOAL OF ANY OF MY ADVENTURES IS TO REMIND US ALL THAT
trainval/mPCDOij0bB0/50010 THERE'S NO LAND THERE'S NO MARKER THAT ICE IS MOVING AND DRIFTING SO AFTER A FEW MINUTES WE
trainval/Mpge4XQqfac/50001 ONE OF THE GREAT CARICATURISTS OF AMERICA ED SOREL ONCE
trainval/Mpge4XQqfac/50002 MY EDITOR CAME IN ONE DAY AND SAID
trainval/Mpge4XQqfac/50003 THEY CANNOT KNOCK OUT A WOMAN IN AN ELEVATOR
trainval/Mpge4XQqfac/50004 THEY CANNOT SHOOT AN UNARMED TEENAGER DEAD
trainval/MpISFKqk0Ew/50001 OUR GRANDPARENTS' GENERATION CREATED AN AMAZING SYSTEM OF CANALS AND RESERVOIRS THAT MADE IT
trainval/MpISFKqk0Ew/50002 FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO LIVE IN ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT CITIES WE'VE NEVER TRULY
trainval/MpISFKqk0Ew/50003 AND THAT'S BECAUSE WHEN THINGS HAVE GOTTEN BAD IN THE PAST IT'S ALWAYS BEEN POSSIBLE TO EXPAND A RESERVOIR
trainval/MpISFKqk0Ew/50004 BUT MY OWN EXPERIENCES WORKING WITH SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST WATER STARVED CITIES IN THE LAST DECADES
trainval/MpISFKqk0Ew/50005 AND IN THE PROCESS OF PASSING THROUGH THE WETLAND AND PERCOLATING THROUGH THE GROUND THE WATER ENCOUNTERS
trainval/MpISFKqk0Ew/50006 WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A COUPLE OF DECADES NOW
trainval/MpISFKqk0Ew/50007 AND THE PLACE WHERE WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WATER CONSERVATION IS OUTDOORS BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER
trainval/MpISFKqk0Ew/50008 WE'VE MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS IN SEAWATER DESALINATION IN THE PAST TWO DECADES
trainval/MPMr5jPwA7I/50001 EVERYTHING'S MISSING OUT OF YOUR HOUSE
trainval/MPMr5jPwA7I/50002 YOUR KIDS WANT THAT NEW XBOX 1 FOR CHRISTMAS BUT YOU WEREN'T GOING TO CAMP OUT FOR 48H AT WALLMART
trainval/MPMr5jPwA7I/50003 I THE DA HAVE TO FLY THEM BACK TO BIRMINGHAM PUT THEM UP A SAFE PLACE WHERE THEY
trainval/MPMr5jPwA7I/50004 I HAVE CONNECTIONS EVERYWHERE
trainval/MPMr5jPwA7I/50005 OKAY ONE OF HIS DEPUTIES
trainval/MPMr5jPwA7I/50006 WARNER TELL YOU WHAT JUST SEND ME A AFFIDAVIT THAT SAYS YOU OR YOUR WIFE WILL FLY TO SAN DIEGO AT YOUR OWN EXPENSE STAY IN A
trainval/MPMr5jPwA7I/50007 I SAID WELL THAT WOULD COST ME MORE THAN THE 1800 I LOST
trainval/MPMr5jPwA7I/50008 HE SAID RIGHT CALL YOUR BANK GET THE MONEY BACK
trainval/MPMr5jPwA7I/50009 NO YOU SHOULD BUY INTRUSION DETECTION SOFTWARE WHAT YOU REALLY NEED IS INTRUSION PREVENTION SOFTWARE
trainval/MPMr5jPwA7I/50010 ISN'T IT THE GOVERNMENTS JOB TO PROTECT ITS CITIZENS
trainval/MPMr5jPwA7I/50011 I HEARD A STORY FROM RICHARD CLARCK I WAS AT THE DARPA CYBER COLLOQUIUM IN 2011 AND HE SAID WHAT
trainval/MPMr5jPwA7I/50012 THE RUSSIANS MAY COME AFTER US
trainval/MPMr5jPwA7I/50013 SO HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO
trainval/MPMr5jPwA7I/50014 I'LL TAKE CARE OF DEFENDING THE GOVERNMENT FACILITIES BUT YOU GUYS MIGHT WANT TO LOOK INTO SOME ANTI AIRCRAFT AND MAYBE SOME
trainval/MPMr5jPwA7I/50015 BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH CYBER CRIME
trainval/MPMr5jPwA7I/50016 TO REPORT A CYBER CRIME
trainval/MPMr5jPwA7I/50017 I SAID WELL I'LL START WITH MY ALMA MATER AT UAB
trainval/MPMr5jPwA7I/50018 THEY SAID WELL I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE OBJECTIVE
trainval/MPMr5jPwA7I/50019 WELL WE HAVE STUDENTS IN THE FBI AND IN THE CIA AND THE NSA
trainval/MPMr5jPwA7I/50020 WE'VE GOT STUDENTS ALL OVER THE WORLD WHO ARE FIGHTING CYBERCRIME THE WAY I DO
trainval/mpqrO2agOTs/50001 OR TO TAKE IT TO ANOTHER LEVEL
trainval/mpqrO2agOTs/50002 MAYBE THEY'D DONE SOMETHING THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US
trainval/mpqrO2agOTs/50003 BUT OVER TIME WE SAW FRIENDS TRANSFORMED BY THE PRACTICE WE READ COMMENTARY FROM ACROSS THE AGES A LOT OF IT
trainval/mpqrO2agOTs/50004 WE WEREN'T IN TOTAL SILENCE FOR 18 MONTHS
trainval/mpqrO2agOTs/50005 FAR FROM IT
trainval/mpqrO2agOTs/50006 WHO CAN TAKE 18 MONTHS
trainval/mpqrO2agOTs/50007 I'M A LONG WAY FROM THAT MOUNTAIN RETREAT NOW
trainval/mpqrO2agOTs/50008 BUT THIS IS SOMETHING EVERY ONE OF US CAN DO NOW
trainval/MpYrJs0rX84/50001 THEY BUY PRODUCTS ON DEMAND
trainval/MqnbE5WRPEU/50001 EINSTEIN SAID I FEAR THE DAY WHEN TECHNOLOGY TAKES OVER OUR HUMAN INTERACTION
trainval/MqnbE5WRPEU/50002 YOU MIGHT ASK
trainval/MqnbE5WRPEU/50003 WHEN I CALL YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN YOU FEEL DIFFERENTLY ABOUT YOURSELF
trainval/MqnbE5WRPEU/50004 YOU SIT UP STRAIGHTER YOU FEEL POSITIVE AND CONFIDENT AND YOU SEND OUT WITH YOUR BODY LANGUAGE AND YOUR POSTURE
trainval/MqnbE5WRPEU/50005 THIS IS THE MAGIC OF BALLROOM DANCING
trainval/MqnbE5WRPEU/50006 THE STUDY AT THE EINSTEIN MEDICAL COLLEGE SAID BALLROOM DANCING TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK
trainval/MqnbE5WRPEU/50007 MY FATHER WAS FROM BELFAST NORTHERN IRELAND AND HE WAS PROTESTANT MY MOTHER PALESTINIAN
trainval/MqnbE5WRPEU/50008 NOW BEING PALESTINIAN MEANT WE WERE UPROOTED FROM OUR HOME IN 1948 FOR THE CREATION OF THE STATE
trainval/MqnbE5WRPEU/50009 HE WAS NINE YEARS OLD
trainval/MqnbE5WRPEU/50010 THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER SIMILAR STORIES BUT BALLROOM DANCING ISN'T ONLY FOR CHILDREN
trainval/MqnbE5WRPEU/50011 I RETURNED TO JAFFA AND I WORKED WITH JEWISH AND PALESTINIAN
trainval/MqnbE5WRPEU/50012 THIS WAS THE HARDEST PROJECT I HAVE EVER EVER DONE YET THE MOST
trainval/MqnbE5WRPEU/50013 ASKING THESE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THESE BOYS AND GIRLS TO DANCE TOGETHER BALLROOM STYLE
trainval/mQOOgDqUta0/50001 WE CAN'T EVEN SEND OUR OWN ASTRONAUTS INTO SPACE ANYMORE
trainval/mQOOgDqUta0/50002 THAT REALLY INTRIGUED ME
trainval/mQOOgDqUta0/50003 PRIVATE COMPANIES CAN HELP LOWER THAT COST THEY ALREADY HAVE
trainval/mQOOgDqUta0/50004 FOR INSTANCE SPACEX IS PROJECTING LAUNCH COSTS AS LOW AS 5 MILLION BY THE TIME THEIR TECHNOLOGY BECOMES MATURE THAT'S ALMOST 100
trainval/mQOOgDqUta0/50005 PRIVATE INDUSTRY CAN BRING WITH IT LOTS OF DIFFERENT BENEFITS
trainval/mQOOgDqUta0/50006 AND NOT JUST HOCKEY RIGHT
trainval/mQOOgDqUta0/50008 IT'S CREATING SOME EXCITEMENT OBVIOUSLY IT'S CREATING SOME DEMAND
trainval/mQOOgDqUta0/50009 ASHTON KUTCHER'S GOING INTO SPACE THAT'S GREAT
trainval/mQOOgDqUta0/50010 TRANSPORTATION COMMUNICATION EDUCATION THESE ARE ALL AREAS ON EARTH THAT HAVE PROBLEMS THAT IN
trainval/mQOOgDqUta0/50011 WHY DO WE SPEND ALL THESE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO SEND ROVERS TO MARS
trainval/mQOOgDqUta0/50012 YOU CAN EXPLORE SPACE FOR THE SHEER EXCITEMENT OF IT FOR THE SCIENCE
trainval/mQOOgDqUta0/50013 THAT WOULD BE PRETTY AWESOME RIGHT
trainval/mQOOgDqUta0/50014 IT WOULD PROBABLY GIVE THE ASTRONAUTS A LITTLE PICK ME UP IN THE MORNING BEFORE THEIR SPACEWALK
trainval/mqovAg11qSc/50001 PEOPLE THINK THAT NOW THAT WE HAVE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY THE BOOK IS GOING TO DIE AND
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50001 THE THREE CHILDREN THAT STILL LIVE WITH HER SUFFER FROM A WHOLE RANGE OF PROBLEMS AND NONE OF THEM ARE IN EDUCATION
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50002 AND ELLA SAYS TO ME THAT SHE IS REPEATING THE CYCLE OF HER OWN MOTHER'S LIFE BEFORE HER
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50003 BUT WHEN I MET ELLA THERE WERE 73 DIFFERENT SERVICES ON OFFER FOR HER AND HER FAMILY IN THE CITY WHERE SHE LIVES
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50004 THEY THINK NOTHING OF CALLING SOCIAL SERVICES TO TRY AND MEDIATE ONE OF THE MANY ARGUMENTS THAT BROKE OUT
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50005 SO I'VE SPENT TIME LIVING WITH FAMILIES LIKE ELLA'S IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW WHAT CAN WE LEARN
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50006 I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO LIVE IN ELLA'S FAMILY
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50007 I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND WHAT WE CAN DO DIFFERENTLY
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50008 WELL THE FIRST THING I LEARNED IS THAT COST IS A REALLY SLIPPERY CONCEPT
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50009 BECAUSE WHEN THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT A FAMILY LIKE ELLA'S COSTS A QUARTER OF A MILLION POUNDS A YEAR TO MANAGE WHAT IT REALLY
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50010 AND I ALSO SPENT TIME WITH THE FRONTLINE WORKERS AND I LEARNED THAT IT IS AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50011 SO TOM WHO IS THE SOCIAL WORKER FOR ELLA'S 14 YEAR OLD SON RYAN HAS TO SPEND 86
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50012 HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50013 WHEN DID YOU GO TO SCHOOL
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50014 AND THIS KIND OF INTERACTION RULES OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A NORMAL CONVERSATION
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50015 IT RULES OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF WHAT'S NEEDED TO BUILD A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TOM AND RYAN
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50016 SO IN A REALLY BRAVE STEP THE LEADERS OF THE CITY WHERE ELLA LIVES AGREED THAT WE COULD START BY REVERSING RYAN'S RATIO
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50017 SO EVERYONE WHO CAME INTO CONTACT WITH ELLA OR A FAMILY LIKE ELLA'S WOULD SPEND 80 PERCENT OF THEIR TIME WORKING WITH THE
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50018 AND THE MOTHERS GO YOU'RE THE SYSTEM
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50019 AND THE MOTHERS SAY THANK YOU
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50020 THEY SHOWED THEIR HUMAN QUALITIES AND CONVINCED THE MOTHERS THAT THEY WOULD STICK WITH THEM THROUGH THICK AND THIN EVEN THOUGH THEY WOULDN'T BE SOFT
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50021 AND ONE MOTHER TOOK THE MONEY AND SHE USED IT AS A FLOAT TO START A SOCIAL ENTERPRISE
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50022 THE TV'S ON AT FULL VOLUME
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50023 AND ALL THE SAME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS TRANSFORMATION SAME FAMILIES SAME
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50024 BUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM HAS BEEN SUPPORTED TO CHANGE
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50025 I'M TALKING ABOUT THE SIMPLE HUMAN BONDS BETWEEN US A KIND OF AUTHENTIC SENSE OF CONNECTION OF BELONGING THE BONDS THAT
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50026 THE CONTEMPORARIES OF WILLIAM BEVERIDGE WHO WAS THE ARCHITECT OF THE FIRST WELFARE STATE AND THE AUTHOR OF THE BEVERIDGE REPORT
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50028 ONE OF HER SONS IS FIGHTING WITH ONE OF HER DAUGHTERS
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50029 AND THE BUREAUCRAT WHO WOULD BE DETACHED AND WORK IN THIS SYSTEM
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50030 SO SOME YEARS AGO WANTING TO UNDERSTAND THIS PROBLEM I STARTED TO WORK WITH A GROUP OF ABOUT 60 OLDER PEOPLE IN SOUTH
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50031 AND THE IMPACT OF BEVERIDGE ON THE WAY THE MODERN STATE SEES SOCIAL ISSUES JUST CAN'T BE UNDERESTIMATED
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50032 SO WE RENTED A PHONE LINE HIRED A COUPLE OF HANDYMEN AND STARTED A SERVICE WE CALLED CIRCLE
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50033 AND CIRCLE OFFERS ITS LOCAL MEMBERSHIP A TOLL FREE 0 800 NUMBER THAT THEY CAN CALL ON DEMAND FOR ANY
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50034 THEY'VE CALLED BECAUSE THEIR PETS ARE UNWELL THEIR DVD IS BROKEN THEY'VE FORGOTTEN HOW TO USE THEIR MOBILE PHONE OR MAYBE THEY ARE COMING
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50035 SO LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT BELINDA
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50036 AND DAMON WHO RUNS THE LOCAL CIRCLE CALLS HER BACK AND SAYS HOW CAN I HELP
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50037 SO FIVE CIRCLE MEMBERS HAD ORGANIZED THEMSELVES TO TAKE CARE OF BELINDA
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50038 BUT THE SIMPLE ACT OF ENCOURAGING HER TO COME ALONG TO THAT FIRST EVENT LED TO A PROCESS WHERE NATURAL
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50039 CIRCLE HAS GOT THIS VERY SIMPLE SYSTEM THAT UNDERPINS IT ENABLES A SMALL LOCAL TEAM TO SUPPORT A MEMBERSHIP OF UP TO A THOUSAND
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50040 AND YOU CAN CONTRAST THIS WITH A NEIGHBORHOOD ORGANIZATION OF THE 1970S WHEN THIS KIND OF SCALE JUST WASN'T POSSIBLE NEITHER WAS THE QUALITY
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50041 THE CULTURES THE BUREAUCRACIES THE INSTITUTIONS THEY ARE GLOBAL AND THEY'VE COME TO SEEM LIKE
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50042 SO PROFESSIONALS HAVE TO ADMINISTER THESE INCREASINGLY COMPLEX FORMS OF ADMINISTRATION THAT ARE BASICALLY ABOUT STOPPING
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50043 THEY'VE BECOME SO INGRAINED IN US THAT ACTUALLY WE DON'T EVEN SEE THEM ANYMORE
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50044 THEY LED TO LONGER LIFESPANS THE ERADICATION OF MASS DISEASE MASS HOUSING ALMOST UNIVERSAL
trainval/Mr8nvXvlSy8/50045 AND HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS WERE ALREADY WITHERING
trainval/MrEuta9GPGM/50001 TAP WATER LESS THAN A PENNY
trainval/mRgSUwk1hnE/50001 YES YOU CAN GET YOUR GENOME SEQUENCED IN TWO WEEKS
trainval/mRgSUwk1hnE/50002 YES IT CAN COST ROUGHLY 1000 DOLLARS
trainval/MS4x6G0zzeg/50001 AND WE CAN DO THE SAME THING WITH DIGITAL PRIVACY
trainval/MS4x6G0zzeg/50002 THINK ABOUT HAVING SURGERY
trainval/MS4x6G0zzeg/50003 RIGHT NOW IF I SEND YOU AN IMAGE YOU CAN FORWARD THAT TO ANYONE THAT YOU WANT
trainval/MS4x6G0zzeg/50004 BUT YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE THE JERK WHO SAYS WELL I GUESS YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE SKIING THEN
trainval/MS4x6G0zzeg/50005 BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS NOT SEXTING THE ISSUE IS DIGITAL PRIVACY
trainval/mS8tQSTYLgk/50001 WOULD YOU BE COMFORTABLE TALKING TO THEM
trainval/mS8tQSTYLgk/50002 WHAT IF INSTEAD OF THE HOSPITAL THEY WERE AT YOUR KITCHEN TABLE AND TOLD YOU THEY WERE REALLY DEPRESSED
trainval/mS8tQSTYLgk/50003 HERE ARE SOME POSSIBLE REASONS WHY SOME OF YOU MAY AVOID DEPRESSED PEOPLE
trainval/mS8tQSTYLgk/50004 YOU MAY WORRY THAT YOU WON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY AND EVERY ATTEMPT AT CONVERSATION WILL
trainval/mS8tQSTYLgk/50005 YOU MIGHT FEAR SEEING YOUR SHADOW
trainval/mS8tQSTYLgk/50006 YOU THINK OF THEM AS FLAWED OR DEFECTIVE
trainval/mS8tQSTYLgk/50007 I LIVE PRETTY WELL WITH MY BIPOLAR CONDITION AND I'VE OVERCOME SOME OTHER MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS LIKE
trainval/mS8tQSTYLgk/50008 IT'S NOT HARD SCIENCE BUT I WORKED WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE I KNOW WHO'VE LIVED WITH DEPRESSION
trainval/mS8tQSTYLgk/50009 IT'S JUST WE ALREADY THOUGHT OF THAT
trainval/mS8tQSTYLgk/50010 PEOPLE CAN BE SAD AND OKAY AT THE SAME TIME
trainval/mS8tQSTYLgk/50011 SO SOME OF THESE THINGS MAY APPLY TO YOU PERSONALLY SOME MAY NOT
trainval/mS8tQSTYLgk/50012 TAKE WHAT'S USEFUL
trainval/mS8tQSTYLgk/50013 YOU DON'T HAVE TO CONNECT
trainval/mS8tQSTYLgk/50014 I HAVE TOLD PEOPLE HEY CALL OR TEXT ANY TIME BUT I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO YOU THAT SAME DAY
trainval/mS8tQSTYLgk/50015 CAN I CALL YOU EVERY DAY
trainval/mS8tQSTYLgk/50016 MAYBE TEXT YOU EVERY DAY AND CALL LATER IN THE WEEK
trainval/mS8tQSTYLgk/50017 ALSO THINGS THAT MAKE SOME PEOPLE FEEL BETTER MAY NOT WORK FOR US
trainval/mS8tQSTYLgk/50018 WHAT WORKS FOR YOU
trainval/mS8tQSTYLgk/50019 I'M JUST LETTING YOU SEE THAT DEPRESSED PEOPLE CAN IMAGINE ESCAPING THEIR LIVES AS CASUALLY AS SOME OF YOU
trainval/mS8tQSTYLgk/50020 YOUR DEPRESSED FRIENDS COULD BE A GOOD SOURCE OF FREE LABOR
trainval/mSASZGgHy0g/50001 THIS IS BY OUR DEAR FRIEND MARK STEWART
trainval/MSE5Vryrd0I/50001 HE HAS TO LEAVE HIS COUNTRY WITHOUT HIS CHILDREN WITHOUT HIS GRANDCHILDREN
trainval/MSE5Vryrd0I/50002 SO WE PUT UP A FACEBOOK POST AND 20 TAILORS RESPONDED
trainval/MSE5Vryrd0I/50003 GALEB HAS HAD A LONG JOURNEY
trainval/MSE5Vryrd0I/50004 IT WAS A FRIGHTENING JOURNEY TO COME TO THE NETHERLANDS
trainval/MSE5Vryrd0I/50005 HE LOST HIS FAMILY HE COULDN'T BE TOGETHER WITH HIS FAMILY AGAIN
trainval/MSE5Vryrd0I/50006 AND FROM EMMEN JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO THEY TRANSFERRED HIM TO A SHELTER IN HOOGEVEEN
trainval/MSE5Vryrd0I/50007 MOHAS STUDIED FOR OVER SIX YEARS IN SYRIA TO BECOME A DENTIST AND THEN HE HAD TO FLEE HIS COUNTRY
trainval/MSE5Vryrd0I/50008 AND THEY WORKED TOGETHER FOR A FEW DAYS AND AFTER A WEEK OR SO SHE PHONED ME AND SHE SAID
trainval/MSE5Vryrd0I/50009 I'M SUPER SUPER ENTHUSIASTIC BECAUSE HIS WORK HIS HANDS
trainval/MSE5Vryrd0I/50010 YOU KNOW HE REALLY HAS THIS IN HIS FINGERS
trainval/MSE5Vryrd0I/50011 SO I THINK LET'S TRY IT
trainval/MSE5Vryrd0I/50012 BUT YOU KNOW IT'S A START
trainval/MSE5Vryrd0I/50013 AND TO OVERCOME ALL THESE TRAUMAS I THINK THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO RESTART THEIR LIVES
trainval/MSE5Vryrd0I/50015 THE HARDER IT IS TO REINTEGRATE INTO A WORKPLACE
trainval/MSE5Vryrd0I/50016 I DIDN'T FIND TWO OFFICIALS WORKING IN THE SAME DEPARTMENT
trainval/MSE5Vryrd0I/50017 SO I THINK WE DUTCH ORGANIZATIONS NGOS VOLUNTARY GROUPS
trainval/MSLHHgSXloM/50001 WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT
trainval/MSLHHgSXloM/50002 BUT THEN YOU THINK THEY MIGHT NOT AND YOU'RE NEVER QUITE SURE WHICH IT IS UNTIL SOMEBODY TELLS YOU OFF
trainval/MSLHHgSXloM/50003 SO INSTEAD YOU ANSWER
trainval/MSLHHgSXloM/50004 BUT AFTER SHE LEAVES YOU FIGURE IT OUT SO YOU STAY THERE FOR A WHILE BECAUSE YOU'RE REALLY EMBARRASSED AND YOU'RE FIGHTING BACK TEARS AND
trainval/MSLHHgSXloM/50005 AND YOU KIND OF LIKE IT THAT WAY BECAUSE IN REAL LIFE THERE IS NO EDIT FUNCTION
trainval/MSLHHgSXloM/50006 YOU'RE ALWAYS LATE THOUGH BECAUSE YOU JUST CAN'T DRUM UP THE NERVE
trainval/MSLHHgSXloM/50007 SO YOU START EATING KALE AND PARSLEY GARNISH FROM THE NOW EMPTY TRAY AND LECTURE YOUR CO
trainval/MSLHHgSXloM/50008 SO YOU ALREADY KNOW THE RULES
trainval/MSLHHgSXloM/50009 AND TO LOOK AT TOYS WITHOUT TOUCHING
trainval/MSLHHgSXloM/50010 RICH AMAZING STORIES OF ALL REAL PEOPLE
trainval/MSLHHgSXloM/50011 LIKE WITH MOST THINGS IN MY LIFE I RESEARCHED I ATTENDED CONFERENCES I HAD
trainval/MSLHHgSXloM/50012 IN THE END MAKING A GOOD FORTH IMPRESSION WASN'T ENOUGH TO WIN OVER THOSE PARTICULAR COLLEAGUES BUT
trainval/MSLHHgSXloM/50013 SO FUNNY I MET HER AT A CONFERENCE I SAW HER AT THE CONFERENCE
trainval/MSLHHgSXloM/50014 AND OF COURSE TEMPLE GRANDIN
trainval/MSLHHgSXloM/50015 I'M A TEMPLE GRANDIN GROUPIE
trainval/MSLHHgSXloM/50016 HE WAS WILLING TO LOOK BEYOND MY LACK OF SOCIAL FINESSE IN THE WORK PLACE PASSED THE FIRST SECOND AND
trainval/MSLHHgSXloM/50017 AND FOR SEVERAL WEEKS WE WORKED ON FACIAL EXPRESSIONS POSTURE BODY
trainval/MSLHHgSXloM/50018 WE ALL LIKE TO TICK OFF OUR BOXES
trainval/MSLHHgSXloM/50019 IT IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO REMAIN STUCK IN RIGIDITY AND INTOLERANCE
trainval/MSLHHgSXloM/50020 IF YOU ARE A WILLING ASPIE ALLIED
trainval/mSQmfZOVNPw/50001 AND R AMP B ENTERPRISES WAS VERY PROFITABLE AT THE TIME SO THE SON REFUSED
trainval/mSQmfZOVNPw/50002 BUT MY DAD APOLOGIZED EXPLAINED THE SITUATION AND STRATEGIZED THE BEST PLAN TO START PRODUCTION
trainval/mSQmfZOVNPw/50003 MY DAD WAS WORKING 20 HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK AND MY MOM WAS WORKING FULL TIME
trainval/mSQmfZOVNPw/50004 MY PARENTS RISKED THEIR LIVES TO COME TO THIS COUNTRY IN HOPES OF A BETTER ONE NOT KNOWING WHETHER OR NOT
trainval/mSvyBpWueu4/50001 I TALKED TO MY FATHER
trainval/mSvyBpWueu4/50002 SO HE FIGURED OUT
trainval/mSvyBpWueu4/50003 AND THE DAY BEFORE THE ACTUAL CEREMONY HAPPENS WE WERE DANCING HAVING EXCITEMENT AND
trainval/mSvyBpWueu4/50004 THEY WERE ALL IN A CIRCLE
trainval/mSvyBpWueu4/50005 I GOT A SCHOLARSHIP BUT I NEEDED TO GET MYSELF HERE
trainval/mSvyBpWueu4/50006 WE CAN'T DO THIS
trainval/mSvyBpWueu4/50007 AS I WENT BACK EVERY TIME I WENT I FOUND THAT MY NEIGHBORS' GIRLS WERE GETTING MARRIED
trainval/mSvyBpWueu4/50008 WE GAVE HER THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME TO THE CLASS
trainval/MSX0uwAG2Jc/50001 AS A LOVER OF HUMAN ANATOMY I'M SO EXCITED THAT WE'RE FINALLY PUTTING OUR BODIES AT THE CENTER OF FOCUS
trainval/Mtjatz9rSVc/50001 HOW CAN YOU CHANGE THE WORLD
trainval/Mtjatz9rSVc/50002 THEY WANTED TO BRING COMPUTING POWER TO EVERYONE
trainval/Mtjatz9rSVc/50003 MAKE A MANTRA
trainval/Mtjatz9rSVc/50004 NOT SPREADSHEET DATABASE OR WORD PROCESSOR
trainval/Mtjatz9rSVc/50006 SO I BELIEVE THAT BOZOSITY IS LIKE THE FLU
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50001 SNOBBERY IS A GLOBAL PHENOMENON WE ARE A GLOBAL ORGANIZATION THIS IS A GLOBAL PHENOMENON
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50002 WHAT IS A SNOB
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50004 THE DOMINANT KIND OF SNOBBERY THAT EXISTS NOWADAYS IS JOB SNOBBERY
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50005 MOST PEOPLE MAKE A STRICT CORRELATION BETWEEN HOW MUCH TIME AND IF YOU LIKE LOVE NOT ROMANTIC LOVE THOUGH THAT MAY BE
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50006 AND THAT'S A LOT OF THE REASON WHY WE CARE SO MUCH ABOUT OUR CAREERS AND INDEED START CARING SO MUCH ABOUT
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50007 IT'S PERHAPS EASIER NOW THAN EVER BEFORE TO MAKE A GOOD LIVING
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50008 I DON'T THINK WE ARE PARTICULARLY MATERIALISTIC
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50009 THERE ARE OTHER REASONS WHY IT'S PERHAPS HARDER NOW TO FEEL CALM THAN EVER BEFORE
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50010 AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL IDEA
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50011 ENVY IT'S A REAL TABOO TO MENTION ENVY BUT IF THERE'S ONE DOMINANT EMOTION IN MODERN SOCIETY THAT IS ENVY
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50012 LET ME EXPLAIN
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50013 THE PROBLEM OF MODERN SOCIETY IS IT TURNS THE WHOLE WORLD INTO A SCHOOL
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50014 EVERYBODY'S WEARING JEANS EVERYBODY'S THE SAME
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50015 AND YET THEY'RE NOT
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50016 YOU CAN MAKE IT
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50017 THERE IS ANOTHER REASON WHY WE MIGHT BE FEELING MORE ANXIOUS ABOUT OUR CAREERS ABOUT OUR STATUS IN THE WORLD TODAY
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50018 AND IT'S AGAIN LINKED TO SOMETHING NICE
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50019 IT'S A BEAUTIFUL IDEA
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50020 THE PROBLEM IS IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE IN A SOCIETY WHERE THOSE WHO MERIT TO GET TO THE TOP GET TO THE TOP
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50021 IN OTHER WORDS YOUR POSITION IN LIFE COMES TO SEEM NOT ACCIDENTAL BUT MERITED AND DESERVED
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50022 AND THAT MAKES FAILURE SEEM MUCH MORE CRUSHING
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50023 NOWADAYS PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES IF YOU MEET SOMEONE AT THE BOTTOM OF SOCIETY THEY MAY UNKINDLY BE DESCRIBED AS A
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50024 THAT'S EXHILARATING IF YOU'RE DOING WELL AND VERY CRUSHING IF YOU'RE NOT
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50025 AND SOME OF THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT PEOPLE TAKE WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM EXTREMELY PERSONALLY THEY OWN THEIR SUCCESS BUT THEY
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50027 AUGUSTINE ONLY GOD CAN REALLY PUT EVERYBODY IN THEIR PLACE HE'S GOING TO DO THAT ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT WITH ANGELS AND
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50028 IN OTHER WORDS HOLD YOUR HORSES WHEN YOU'RE COMING TO JUDGE PEOPLE
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50029 YOU DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT SOMEONE'S TRUE VALUE IS
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50030 WHEN WE THINK ABOUT FAILING IN LIFE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT FAILURE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE FEAR FAILING IS NOT JUST A LOSS OF
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50031 IF YOU OPEN THE NEWSPAPER ANY DAY OF THE WEEK IT'S FULL OF PEOPLE WHO'VE MESSED UP THEIR LIVES
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50032 THEY'VE SLEPT WITH THE WRONG PERSON TAKEN THE WRONG SUBSTANCE PASSED THE WRONG PIECE OF LEGISLATION WHATEVER IT IS AND THEN ARE FIT
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50033 IN OTHER WORDS THEY HAVE FAILED
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50034 AND THEY ARE DESCRIBED AS LOSERS
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50035 NOW IS THERE ANY ALTERNATIVE TO THIS
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50036 THEY CAME UP WITH LOVE CRAZED IMMIGRANT KILLS SENATOR'S DAUGHTER
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50037 THERE ARE SIMPLY TOO MANY RANDOM FACTORS ACCIDENTS ACCIDENTS OF BIRTH ACCIDENTS OF THINGS DROPPING ON PEOPLE'S HEADS
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50038 AT THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM YOU'VE GOT TRAGEDY AND TRAGIC ART
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50039 HE IS NOT A LOSER THOUGH HE HAS LOST
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50040 AND SO WE TEND TO WORSHIP OURSELVES
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50042 MOST OTHER SOCIETIES HAVE HAD RIGHT AT THEIR CENTER THE WORSHIP OF SOMETHING TRANSCENDENT A GOD A SPIRIT A NATURAL FORCE
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50043 WE'VE SLIGHTLY LOST THE HABIT OF DOING THAT WHICH IS I THINK WHY WE'RE PARTICULARLY DRAWN TO NATURE
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50044 NOT FOR THE SAKE OF OUR HEALTH THOUGH IT'S OFTEN PRESENTED THAT WAY BUT BECAUSE IT'S AN ESCAPE FROM THE HUMAN ANTHILL
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50045 IT'S AN ESCAPE FROM OUR OWN COMPETITION AND OUR OWN DRAMAS
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50046 AUGUSTINE IN THE CITY OF GOD WHERE HE SAYS IT'S A SIN TO JUDGE ANY MAN BY HIS POST
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50047 WE HEAR A LOT OF TALK ABOUT WORK LIFE BALANCE
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50048 YOU CAN'T HAVE IT ALL
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50049 NO ONE'S QUITE LISTENING HARD ENOUGH BUT I VERY MUCH BELIEVE IT'S TRUE
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50050 IT'S NOT THE POST THAT SHOULD COUNT
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50051 SO I'M GOING TO END IT THERE
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50052 BUT WHAT I REALLY WANT TO STRESS IS BY ALL MEANS SUCCESS YES
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50053 BUT LET'S ACCEPT THE STRANGENESS OF SOME OF OUR IDEAS
trainval/MtSE4rglxbY/50054 WE NEED FATHERS AS IT WERE THE EXEMPLARY FATHER FIGURES IN SOCIETY AVOIDING THE TWO EXTREMES
trainval/Mu00S1dAMl4/50001 THEY ARE TAKING STEALING SO MUCH OF OUR TIME OUR LOVE OUR
trainval/Mu00S1dAMl4/50002 HONESTLY WHAT WOULD YOU SEE
trainval/Mu00S1dAMl4/50003 SILENT WHEN SHE SPOKE SLOWLY TO MY FRIEND AND THEN WALKED ARM IN ARM WITH HIM LIKE A FASHIONABLE BRACELET
trainval/mUJdzaLDRIo/50001 AND I LOOKED FOR THAT POSSIBILITY AND THE POSSIBILITY WAS PERSONAL FREEDOM
trainval/mUJdzaLDRIo/50002 REMEMBER THE HAND
trainval/mUJdzaLDRIo/50003 WE HAVE SEEN THIS QUESTION SEVERAL TIMES WHY
trainval/mulbSSAULSo/50001 AND THEN I ALSO ASKED
trainval/mulbSSAULSo/50002 AND THESE TWO DON'T CONTRADICT EACH OTHER
trainval/mulbSSAULSo/50003 I'VE ANALYZED THE LANGUAGE OF PLATITUDES AND NOW I FIND MYSELF FACING THE
trainval/MUOSpWJ0riQ/50001 WE JUST DID THAT
trainval/MUOSpWJ0riQ/50002 BECAUSE BUT IS A CONTRADICTION WHEREAS AND IS SOME SORT OF CONNECTION
trainval/MUOSpWJ0riQ/50003 YEAH THERE YOU ARE SEXY
trainval/MUOSpWJ0riQ/50004 WHAT PLAY BECOMES AS WE GET OLDER AS WE TAKE IT MORE SERIOUSLY IT BECOMES THE OPPOSITE OF PLAY WHICH IS WORK WHICH EVERYBODY
trainval/MUOSpWJ0riQ/50005 I'M SURE WE ALL KNOW WHAT IMPROVISATION IS RIGHT
trainval/MUOSpWJ0riQ/50006 I'VE GOT THESE SLIDES THAT I HAVE TO USE SO THAT'S ONE RULE I'VE GOT THESE SLIDES IN ORDER
trainval/MUOSpWJ0riQ/50007 LET ME DEFINE WHAT I MEAN BY GAME HERE
trainval/MUOSpWJ0riQ/50008 SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVERYONE
trainval/MV0Iob65Nq4/50001 LIGHT LINES CAN BE DRAWN EVALUATED AND REDRAWN AS MANY TIMES AS NECESSARY IN
trainval/MV0Iob65Nq4/50002 TOO OFTEN PEOPLE EXPERIENCE A SENSE OF SHAME REGARDING THEIR MISTAKES BUT IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT IN YOUR LIFE HAD
trainval/MV0Iob65Nq4/50003 IN FACT NEW IDEAS ONLY OCCUR WHEN WE TAKE RISKS AND OUR FAILURES BECOME PRODUCTIVE
trainval/MV0Iob65Nq4/50004 DRAWING HABITUATES THAT THOUGHT PROCESS AND BEARING IT IN MIND IS A PERFECTLY NATURAL WAY OF
trainval/MV0Iob65Nq4/50005 THIS IDEA CREATE A DANGEROUS MENTAL BLOCK TO HUMAN CAPACITY
trainval/MV0Iob65Nq4/50006 FORTUNATELY RESEARCHERS ARE PROVING THAT MASTERING ANY FIELD DEPENDS MUCH MORE ON
trainval/MV0Iob65Nq4/50007 40 OF OUR BRAIN IS DEVOTED TO PROCESSING VISUAL INFORMATION THAT'S MORE THAN ALL OVER
trainval/MV0Iob65Nq4/50008 THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL WAY TO MAKE AN IMAGE IS TO DRAW ONE
trainval/MV0Iob65Nq4/50009 NOW SPECIFICALLY I'M TALKING ABOUT OBSERVATIONAL DRAWING WHICH MEANS TO OBSERVE SOMETHING AND DRAW AN
trainval/mvC3Qafe5Ms/50001 THERE ARE ROBOTS THAT DO YOUR VACUUMING FOR YOU AND CARS THAT WILL SOON BE ABLE TO SELF DRIVE
trainval/mvC3Qafe5Ms/50003 DIVERSITY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF OUR WORLD AND WITH DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS COME DIFFERENT
trainval/mvC3Qafe5Ms/50004 IS IT ACCEPTABLE TO ALTER A HUMAN BEING AND SUPPOSEDLY IMPROVE THEM IF IT GOES AGAINST THEIR
trainval/mvC3Qafe5Ms/50005 THE FIRST PHONE CALL
trainval/mvC3Qafe5Ms/50006 HOWEVER PARTICIPANTS IN THIS EXPERIMENT WERE NOT EXPLICITLY TOLD THAT THEIR BRAINS WOULD
trainval/mvC3Qafe5Ms/50007 THIS YOUNG MAN WAS NONE OTHER THAN ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL
trainval/MVDXD3oyMJg/50001 THEY NEED FOOD AS IN FLOWERS AND THEY NEED NESTING SIGHTS
trainval/MVDXD3oyMJg/50002 YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW THAT HONEY BEES AREN'T NATIVE TO NORTH AMERICA
trainval/MVDXD3oyMJg/50003 THEY'RE FROM EUROPE
trainval/MVDXD3oyMJg/50004 THEY DON'T LIKE LAVENDER AND CLOVER
trainval/MvMUMShuMaI/50001 EMBRYONIC PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS ARE THE TYPE OF STEM CELL THAT PEOPLE MOST OFTEN
trainval/MvMUMShuMaI/50002 PUT UP YOUR HANDS
trainval/MvMUMShuMaI/50003 AND NOW THAT YOU HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE THE POWER
trainval/MvojSku8zk0/50001 IT'S IN OUR POWER TO PROVIDE ACCESS FOR EVERYONE
trainval/mw2z9lV3W1g/50001 YOU KNOW THERE ARE LESTERS FROM EVERY PART OF SOCIAL SOCIETY
trainval/mw2z9lV3W1g/50002 CLIMATE CHANGE IS MINE BUT IT MIGHT BE FINANCIAL REFORM OR A SIMPLER TAX SYSTEM OR INEQUALITY
trainval/mw2z9lV3W1g/50003 THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO
trainval/mw2z9lV3W1g/50004 I TRIED TO THINK HOW DO I RESPOND TO THAT HOPELESSNESS
trainval/mw2z9lV3W1g/50005 WHAT IS THAT SENSE OF HOPELESSNESS
trainval/mw2z9lV3W1g/50006 OKAY NOTHING I CAN DO
trainval/mWA2uL8zXPI/50001 MY GRANDMOTHER WAS A FIRECRACKER MY MOM IS A PROFESSIONAL MY SISTER AND I ARE LOUD AND THAT'S OUR
trainval/mWA2uL8zXPI/50002 NO QUESTION IT'S CRUCIAL THAT YOUNG PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE GROUND RULES FOR CONSENT
trainval/mWA2uL8zXPI/50003 BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS THAT BOYS DIDN'T WANT TO
trainval/mWA2uL8zXPI/50004 IT WAS THAT GIRLS DIDN'T WANT THEM TO
trainval/mWA2uL8zXPI/50005 GIRLS EXPRESSED A SENSE OF SHAME AROUND THEIR GENITALS
trainval/mWA2uL8zXPI/50006 IT ROSE 80 PERCENT BETWEEN 2014 AND 2015 AND WHEREAS GIRLS UNDER
trainval/mWA2uL8zXPI/50007 WHO IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY
trainval/mWA2uL8zXPI/50008 AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH WANTING TO FEEL CLOSE TO YOUR PARTNER OR WANTING HIM TO BE HAPPY AND ORGASM ISN'T THE ONLY
trainval/mWA2uL8zXPI/50009 NO SURPRISE FEWER THAN HALF OF TEENAGE GIRLS AGE 14 TO 17 HAVE EVER
trainval/mWA2uL8zXPI/50010 THE ONE WHO MAKES OUT WITH A PARTNER FOR THREE HOURS AND EXPERIMENTS WITH SENSUAL TENSION
trainval/mWA2uL8zXPI/50011 CONSIDER A SURVEY OF 300 RANDOMLY CHOSEN GIRLS FROM A DUTCH AND AN
trainval/mWA2uL8zXPI/50012 IN THE LARGEST EVER SURVEY EVER CONDUCTED ON AMERICAN SEXUAL BEHAVIOR THEY REPORTED
trainval/mWfCqsFP05A/50001 I'M NOT GOING TO FAIL THAT
trainval/mWm2qtEeBjE/50001 COM A WEBSITE AND ALL YOU HAD TO DO IN THOSE DAYS WAS BE A WEBSITE HAVE DOT COM' IN YOUR NAME IF FORBES
trainval/mWm2qtEeBjE/50002 THEN THE CRASH CAME OH MY GOSH
trainval/mWm2qtEeBjE/50003 ONLY 3 OF PEOPLE IN POVERTY HAVE JOBS
trainval/mWp4Sp8GTgI/50001 IT'S NOT FROM A POEM
trainval/mWp4Sp8GTgI/50002 SO IF THIS IS SUCH A SMALL SAMPLE OF THE WHOLE HEAVENS WE
trainval/mWp4Sp8GTgI/50003 THAT'S A SCIENTIFIC FACT
trainval/mWp4Sp8GTgI/50004 IN US THE UNIVERSE IS THINKING ABOUT ITSELF
trainval/mWp4Sp8GTgI/50005 TO ME THAT'S A VALID QUESTION
trainval/mWp4Sp8GTgI/50006 AND TO ME IT HAS AN ANSWER
trainval/mWp4Sp8GTgI/50007 WHY IN AMERICAN SOCIETY DO WE STILL HAVE WELL IN SOCIETIES IN GENERAL BUT
trainval/mwrLVvORugw/50001 IT IS RELEVANT MEANINGFUL AND ENGAGING
trainval/mwrLVvORugw/50002 HOW DO I KNOW THIS
trainval/mwrLVvORugw/50003 AND THE PROBLEM IS THE ADULTS
trainval/mwrLVvORugw/50004 THIS WAS MY SCHOOL
trainval/mwrLVvORugw/50005 IT NEEDS TO BE IMPORTANT TO US TO CREATE SCHOOLS THAT WORK BETTER FOR OUR KIDS IF WE
trainval/mwrLVvORugw/50006 PEDAGOGY FIRST TECHNOLOGY SECOND IF APPROPRIATE
trainval/mwrLVvORugw/50007 MY SON NICOLAS IS 9
trainval/mwrLVvORugw/50008 HE GOES TO PS3 IN STATEN ISLAND NEW YORK
trainval/mwrLVvORugw/50009 OUR STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO GO ON LEATHER COUCHES IN A ROOM THAT WE CLEANED OUT AND THEY COULD TAKE NAPS ON THEIR FREE TIME
trainval/mwrLVvORugw/50010 WE TAKE THE OLD INDEPENDENT STUDY CONCEPT
trainval/mwzBJF5Q7Vw/50001 HOW WELL DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME
trainval/mwzBJF5Q7Vw/50002 I LOVE ALL OF THESE WOMEN I ADMIRE THEM I AM FRIENDS WITH ALL OF THEM BUT THIS IS THE ONE I AM GOING TO SPEND THE REST OF
trainval/mwzBJF5Q7Vw/50003 WHAT YOU'RE REALLY TELLING THEM IS
trainval/mwzBJF5Q7Vw/50004 BECAUSE THE PEOPLE RUNNING THAT STORE DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO HAVE THE PEN AND THE MONEY AT THE SAME TIME SO THEY CREATE THIS
trainval/mwzBJF5Q7Vw/50005 WE ALL BENEFIT FROM THIS
trainval/mwzBJF5Q7Vw/50006 BUT AS PEOPLE START BETRAYING THE SOCIAL GOOD WE ALL SUFFER AND WE ALL SUFFER TO A GREAT
trainval/mwzBJF5Q7Vw/50007 IT'S TRUE YOU JUST LOST 100 BUT IF YOU GO INTO YOUR CHECKING ACCOUNT AND YOU WRITE
trainval/mwzBJF5Q7Vw/50008 AND NOT ONLY THAT THE PART OF THE BRAIN THAT GETS ACTIVATED WHEN PEOPLE PLOT AND EXECUTE REVENGE
trainval/mwzBJF5Q7Vw/50009 WHY WOULD PEOPLE FEEL PLEASURE WHEN THEY EXECUTE REVENGE
trainval/mwzBJF5Q7Vw/50010 SO WHAT'S THE LESSON FROM THIS
trainval/mwzBJF5Q7Vw/50011 BESIDES FROM REVENGE BEING ALTRUISTIC
trainval/mwzBJF5Q7Vw/50012 AS SOCIETY IS MOVING TOWARDS ELECTRONIC TRANSACTION DEALING WITH PEOPLE OVER GREAT DISTANCES WHAT
trainval/MwzqSswl4cI/50003 BUT YOU NEVER HAVE AN ODD NUMBER OF COPIES
trainval/MwzqSswl4cI/50004 EVERYTHING IS NATURAL
trainval/MwzqSswl4cI/50006 50 YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
trainval/MwzqSswl4cI/50007 PEOPLE DON'T DO THAT
trainval/MwzqSswl4cI/50008 IT WAS THE FLAVOR OF THE DAY IN THE 60S AND 70S
trainval/MwzqSswl4cI/50010 DRIVING IS DANGEROUS
trainval/MwzqSswl4cI/50011 YOU CAN HAVE AN ACCIDENT
trainval/MwzqSswl4cI/50012 IF I DON'T DRIVE IT'S GOING TO TAKE ME 3 HOURS TO GET HOME
trainval/MwzqSswl4cI/50013 I'M JUST GOING TO WALK
trainval/MwzqSswl4cI/50014 VERY HEALTHY CELERY
trainval/MwzqSswl4cI/50015 MOM WAS A CELERY
trainval/MwzqSswl4cI/50016 SO YOU DON'T HAVE A STEAK
trainval/mxmT10Hk8IM/50001 TWO WEEKS BEFORE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE OFF AND FLY FOR USE IN THE MILITARY THE PROGRAM GOT CANCELED
trainval/mxmT10Hk8IM/50002 BACK IN 1972 THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FINALLY DECIDED TO END IT
trainval/mxmT10Hk8IM/50003 IN THE EARLY 2000S THEY WERE FINALLY DECLASSIFIED AND RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC
trainval/mxmT10Hk8IM/50004 THERE WAS A VERY SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT SAW THESE DOCUMENTS AND SAW THE SAME VISION FOR THE FUTURE THAT THE ORIGINAL
trainval/mxmT10Hk8IM/50005 YES BUT STARS ACTUALLY CAN'T PRODUCE ANYTHING HEAVIER THAN IRON SO THAT'S WHERE THE MIGHTY NEUTRON COMES IN
trainval/mxmT10Hk8IM/50006 WELL THEY KIND OF GET UNSTABLE
trainval/mxmT10Hk8IM/50007 THIS IS HOW NUCLEAR REACTIONS WORK
trainval/mxmT10Hk8IM/50008 IN THE CASE OF A URANIUM FUELED REACTOR WE COULD CONTROL THE REACTION RATES BY CONTROLLING THE AMOUNT OF NEUTRONS THAT
trainval/mxmT10Hk8IM/50009 IN SOME INSTANCES THAT CAN ACCOUNT FOR UP TO AS MANY AS 50 OF THE HURRICANE
trainval/mxmT10Hk8IM/50010 IN ADDITION TO THAT WITH THE THORIUM FUEL CYCLE WE ARE ABLE TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL ISOTOPES
trainval/mxmT10Hk8IM/50011 THESE ARE ISOTOPES USED IN MEDICINE SO THESE ARE USED IN EVERYTHING FROM RADIATION
trainval/mxmT10Hk8IM/50012 WITH NUCLEAR REACTORS IT'S DIFFERENT
trainval/mxmT10Hk8IM/50013 WE CAN USE THAT AND ONCE IT'S DONE WE CAN THROW THAT INTO A LANDFILL AND IT'S ESSENTIALLY BACK AS RADIOACTIVE AS
trainval/mY2LIQbiGbo/50001 I'M ACTUALLY GONNA JUST GO AND SAY I THINK WE SHOULD JUST DO AWAY WITH THE WORD SUSTAINABILITY AS IT RELATES TO HEALTH CARE ALL
trainval/mymMye4purU/50001 THAT'S THE BEWILDERING START OF BEING A BABY
trainval/mymMye4purU/50002 IN FACT THAT'S THE JOB OF LAUGHTER
trainval/Myp1sZBxTR8/50001 AND I STARTED SPRAYING THAT ON THE STREETS IN CAIRO
trainval/mYQx5n5SRVQ/50001 THERE WERE PAPERS EVERYWHERE
trainval/mYQx5n5SRVQ/50002 OUR CREATIVE TEAM CAME UP WITH THIS CONCEPT
trainval/mYQx5n5SRVQ/50003 AND I ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT WHEN WOMEN CAN HELP OTHER WOMEN IT IS SO EMPOWERING
trainval/mYQx5n5SRVQ/50004 NINE YEARS AGO I CO FOUNDED A WOMEN'S ENTREPRENEUR ORGANIZATION IN PENANG TOGETHER WITH MY GOOD FRIEND
trainval/mYQx5n5SRVQ/50005 WHAT CAN WE DO
trainval/mYQx5n5SRVQ/50006 WHAT A POWERFUL MESSAGE TO THEIR CHILDREN
trainval/mYQx5n5SRVQ/50007 I BELIEVE SOMETHING POWERFUL HAPPENS WHEN WE PUT PEN TO PAPER
trainval/mYQx5n5SRVQ/50008 SOME PARENTS ASK ME WHAT IF WE SHARE ABOUT INTEGRITY AND THEN WE FAIL OR WE FALL
trainval/mYQx5n5SRVQ/50009 AND I'M JUST AMAZED AT THE OPENED DOORS
trainval/mYQx5n5SRVQ/50010 WE CAN HAVE SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS CREATE WORKSHOPS
trainval/MywGrRvNkWQ/50001 SHE APPEARS TO HAVE SOME FRIENDS
trainval/MywGrRvNkWQ/50002 PRINCESSES IN FAIRY TALES HAD PARENTS WHO LOVED AND ADORED THEM
trainval/MywGrRvNkWQ/50003 WE ARE SO BEHIND
trainval/MywGrRvNkWQ/50004 THIS CRIME KNOWS NO SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS
trainval/MywGrRvNkWQ/50005 IT AFFECTS ALL OF US
trainval/MywGrRvNkWQ/50006 AND THESE ARE OUR GIRLS
trainval/MZbhgk4S7dA/50001 HOW CAN WE MAKE IT SO THAT THEY'RE HAPPY
trainval/MZbhgk4S7dA/50002 AND IT TURNS OUT KIDS LOVE IT
trainval/MZbhgk4S7dA/50003 ANYWAY YEAH SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON
trainval/mZqL7MC8Eys/50001 SO TO PRESENT A TALK IN ENGLISH IS TO CONTINUE THE STRUCTURES OF INEQUALITY AND INJUSTICE
trainval/mZqL7MC8Eys/50002 AT THE BOTTOM IT SAYS
trainval/mZqL7MC8Eys/50003 AND IT MAKES US BOTH LAUGH WHEN I DO
trainval/mZqL7MC8Eys/50004 IN OTHER READINGS IT WARNS OF ARROGANCE OF PRIDE IN GRAND ACHIEVEMENTS
trainval/mZqL7MC8Eys/50005 TEMPORARY RELIEF COMES BY ALLOWING PEOPLE TIME OUT IN A LANGUAGE IN WHICH THEY CAN REST
trainval/mZqL7MC8Eys/50006 I LABOUR STILL AT THE EDGES OF HER LANGUAGE MANAGING A FEW ROTE LANE SENTENCES OF
trainval/mZqL7MC8Eys/50007 AND I'M HOPELESSLY BAD AT THIS
trainval/mZqL7MC8Eys/50008 MY EXPERIENCES OF BEFRIENDING THOSE AWAITING DEPORTATION TOGETHER WITH MY EXPERIENCE OF RESEARCHING
trainval/mZqL7MC8Eys/50009 IN A VERY REAL SENSE WE WERE REFUSING TO LIVE IN AN ENGLISH ONLY WORLD
trainval/mzu3ira61k8/50001 HI MY NAME IS MARYAM ELASSAR
trainval/mzu3ira61k8/50002 ALLOW ME TO SHARE THIS WITH YOU AS WELL
trainval/mzu3ira61k8/50003 MY DAD IS A FARMER
trainval/mzy84VbSGxk/50001 IT'S WHAT ANALYZES IT AND ALLOW IT TO DO STUFF
trainval/mzy84VbSGxk/50002 IT'S YOUR INSTAGRAM
trainval/mzy84VbSGxk/50003 ALL THESE DIFFERENT ACRONYMS THAT ARE AWESOME BUT ESSENTIALLY IT HAS GOTTEN CHEAPER IT HAS GOTTEN FASTER
trainval/mzy84VbSGxk/50004 I CAN ATTACH THESE TO ONE OF THESE SENSORS WITH THIS LITTLE BIT IN THE MIDDLE AND I CAN START BEAMING INFORMATION TO OTHER THINGS
trainval/mzy84VbSGxk/50006 WHY DOES IT PRESENT SO MANY DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES
trainval/mzy84VbSGxk/50007 WHO THINKS I'LL BE IN THE SAME JOB FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS
trainval/mzy84VbSGxk/50008 WE ARE ENTERING IN A STAGE WHERE EVERYTHING WILL BE CONNECTED
trainval/mzy84VbSGxk/50009 IT'S A REALITY
trainval/N0vRIqeoefs/50001 THAT'S WHAT ART IS FOR
trainval/N0vRIqeoefs/50002 AND IT'S THAT CONVICTION THAT THAT WE ARE TAUGHT THAT I THINK COLORS SO MUCH OF WHETHER WE'RE
trainval/N0vRIqeoefs/50003 MY MOTHER LEFT SCHOOL WHEN SHE WAS 15
trainval/N0vRIqeoefs/50004 SO THE CHILDREN HAVE A PLOT
trainval/N0vRIqeoefs/50005 SHE WAS A SECRETARY
trainval/N0vRIqeoefs/50006 AND I TURN TO CAROLINE AND SHE'S CRYING HER EYES OUT
trainval/N0vRIqeoefs/50007 AND CAROLINE WHO HAD INVESTED SO MUCH IN E
trainval/N0vRIqeoefs/50008 HE SAYS VERY SPECIFICALLY I WANTED THE WORLD TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE SHOULD LOVE AND
trainval/N0vRIqeoefs/50009 WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO GO BACK THROUGH ALL OUR BOOKS AND OUR FILMS ALL OUR FAVORITE THINGS AND SAY ACTUALLY
trainval/N0vRIqeoefs/50011 BUT ALL THESE YEARS LATER WE'VE MADE OUR MARK
trainval/N0vRIqeoefs/50013 NAIPAUL SAID TWO YEARS AGO I CAN READ TWO PARAGRAPHS AND KNOW IMMEDIATELY IF IT'S WRITTEN BY A WOMAN AND I JUST STOP
trainval/N0vRIqeoefs/50014 AND IT GOES ON
trainval/N0vRIqeoefs/50015 LET'S MAKE A CHANGE TO ALL OUR INSTITUTIONS AND NOT JUST IN THE WEST
trainval/N0vRIqeoefs/50017 LET'S WRITE ABOUT IT
trainval/N0vRIqeoefs/50018 LET'S FILM IT
trainval/n1ARQsdNvmI/50001 NO HUMAN CAN EVER DO THAT
trainval/n1ARQsdNvmI/50002 I TRIED TO ANALYZE THAT KIND OF KNOWLEDGE
trainval/n1jA0BKOLSY/50001 THAT KIND OF THING
trainval/n1jA0BKOLSY/50002 AND THAT IS THE MAIN REASON I NOTED
trainval/N2HgOWBXyc4/50001 IT'S NO SECRET THAT THE U
trainval/N37x4GgDVBM/50001 BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT MATHEMATICS HASN'T GOT SOMETHING THAT IT CAN OFFER US BECAUSE
trainval/N37x4GgDVBM/50002 AND THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO SEARCH FOR PATTERNS IN THE WAY THAT WE TALK ABOUT OURSELVES AND THE WAY THAT WE INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER ON AN
trainval/N37x4GgDVBM/50003 AND THEY'VE COME UP WITH SOME SERIOUSLY INTERESTING FINDINGS
trainval/N37x4GgDVBM/50004 BUT THE WAY THAT PEOPLE WOULD VOTE WOULD BE VERY DIFFERENT
trainval/N37x4GgDVBM/50005 THERE'D BE A HUGE SPREAD IN HER SCORES
trainval/N37x4GgDVBM/50006 AND ACTUALLY IT'S THIS SPREAD THAT COUNTS
trainval/N37x4GgDVBM/50007 IT'S THIS SPREAD THAT MAKES YOU MORE POPULAR ON AN ONLINE INTERNET DATING WEBSITE
trainval/N37x4GgDVBM/50008 SO WHAT THAT MEANS THEN IS THAT IF SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT YOU'RE ATTRACTIVE YOU'RE ACTUALLY BETTER OFF
trainval/N37x4GgDVBM/50009 WELL WHY WOULD YOU BOTHER HUMILIATING YOURSELF LET'S BE HONEST
trainval/N37x4GgDVBM/50010 IN MY EXPERIENCE AT LEAST I FIND THAT TYPICALLY PEOPLE DON'T MUCH LIKE BEING RECALLED YEARS AFTER BEING
trainval/N37x4GgDVBM/50011 NOW UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT THIS METHOD DOES COME WITH SOME RISKS
trainval/N37x4GgDVBM/50012 BUT EQUALLY YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO LEAVE IT TOO LONG IF YOU WANT TO MAXIMIZE YOUR CHANCE OF LONG TERM HAPPINESS
trainval/N37x4GgDVBM/50013 BUT THEN IMAGINE THE NEXT PERSON TO COME ALONG IS JUST MARGINALLY LESS BORING DULL AND
trainval/N37x4GgDVBM/50014 WE GIVE OURSELVES A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO PLAY THE FIELD GET A FEEL FOR THE MARKETPLACE OR WHATEVER WHEN WE'RE
trainval/N37x4GgDVBM/50015 NOW I LIKE TO THINK THAT EVERYBODY WOULD IDEALLY LIKE TO AVOID DIVORCE APART FROM I
trainval/N37x4GgDVBM/50016 BUT IT'S A SAD FACT OF MODERN LIFE THAT 1 IN 2 MARRIAGES IN THE STATES ENDS IN
trainval/N37x4GgDVBM/50017 NOW YOU CAN BE FORGIVEN PERHAPS FOR THINKING THAT THE ARGUMENTS THAT PRECEDE A MARITAL BREAKUP ARE NOT
trainval/N37x4GgDVBM/50018 FOR ONE THING IT'S VERY HARD TO KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD BE MEASURING OR WHAT YOU SHOULD BE QUANTIFYING
trainval/N37x4GgDVBM/50019 BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL HE TEAMED UP WITH A MATHEMATICIAN JAMES MURRAY THAT THEY REALLY STARTED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT
trainval/N37x4GgDVBM/50020 AND THE RESULTS THAT THEY FOUND I THINK ARE JUST INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVELY SIMPLE AND INTERESTING
trainval/N37x4GgDVBM/50021 SO I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL
trainval/N37x4GgDVBM/50022 THANKFULLY THERE'S A RATHER DELICIOUS BIT OF MATHEMATICS THAT WE CAN USE TO HELP US OUT HERE CALLED OPTIMAL
trainval/N37x4GgDVBM/50023 BECAUSE FOR ME EQUATIONS AND SYMBOLS AREN'T JUST A THING
trainval/N37x4GgDVBM/50024 THEY'RE A VOICE THAT SPEAKS OUT ABOUT THE INCREDIBLE RICHNESS OF NATURE AND THE STARTLING
trainval/N37x4GgDVBM/50025 BUT I THINK THAT IT'S QUITE INTERESTING TO KNOW THAT THERE IS REALLY MATHEMATICAL EVIDENCE TO SAY THAT YOU SHOULD
trainval/N39xSWTPix0/50001 SIMPLY INSERT PART A INTO SLOT B AND WE SHOULD ALL BE GOOD TO GO
trainval/N39xSWTPix0/50002 AND QUITE FRANKLY THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS
trainval/N39xSWTPix0/50003 BUT ORGASM DIDN'T ACTUALLY EVOLVE UNTIL ABOUT 65 MILLION YEARS AGO WITH THE ADVENT OF MAMMALS
trainval/N39xSWTPix0/50004 BUT SOME ANIMALS HAD IT GOING ON QUITE A BIT BEFORE THAT
trainval/N39xSWTPix0/50005 NOW WHEN HUMANS THINK ABOUT SEX MALE AND FEMALE FORMS ARE GENERALLY WHAT COME TO MIND BUT FOR MANY
trainval/N39xSWTPix0/50006 IT'S SIMPLY NOT GOING TO HAPPEN UNLESS THE FEMALE IS ON BOARD WITH THE ACTION
trainval/N3e8ZG5GzaY/50001 THERE'S TOO MUCH PREPARATION
trainval/N3e8ZG5GzaY/50002 ARE YOU GOING TO BECOME A SUPERSTAR
trainval/N3e8ZG5GzaY/50003 AND SO FOR MUSICIANS WHAT DO WE HAVE
trainval/N3e8ZG5GzaY/50004 WE HAVE TWO CHOICES THEN
trainval/N3e8ZG5GzaY/50005 THERE IS NUMBER ONE
trainval/n3qA8DNc2Ss/50001 ONE WAS THE MIGRATION ALONG THE EAST COAST FROM FLORIDA
trainval/n3qA8DNc2Ss/50002 AND WHEN THEY REALLY WANTED TO GET AWAY THEY WENT TO SEATTLE
trainval/n3qA8DNc2Ss/50003 THEY WERE SHARECROPPERS AND NOT EVEN BEING PAID
trainval/n3qA8DNc2Ss/50004 AND GOT THE CHANCE TO RECORD THIS MUSIC THIS NEW MUSIC THAT THEY WERE CREATING AND TO SPREAD IT
trainval/n3qA8DNc2Ss/50005 WE MIGHT NOT KNOW DIANA ROSS' NAME HAD THERE BEEN NO GREAT MIGRATION
trainval/n3qA8DNc2Ss/50006 THEY WOULD ARREST PEOPLE FROM THE RAILROAD PLATFORMS
trainval/n4EhJ898rSk/50001 IT CONNECTED THOSE TWO PEOPLE
trainval/n4EhJ898rSk/50002 IT'S PROBABLY THE SMALLEST OF THE 21 APPS THAT THE FELLOWS WROTE LAST YEAR
trainval/n4EhJ898rSk/50003 AND THAT'S NOTHING
trainval/n4EhJ898rSk/50004 SO SCOTT WAS SPEAKING PERSON TO PERSON
trainval/n4EhJ898rSk/50005 AND IN THIS CASE A NEIGHBOR SAW IT
trainval/n4EhJ898rSk/50006 WE HAVE TO ENGAGE WITH THE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT
trainval/n4EhJ898rSk/50007 AND THERE'S A GENERATION OUT THERE THAT'S GROWN UP ON THE INTERNET AND THEY KNOW THAT IT'S NOT THAT HARD TO DO THINGS
trainval/n4EhJ898rSk/50008 THEY'RE USING THEIR HANDS
trainval/N4wFyRGilp4/50001 IT HAPPENED THROUGH A PRINCIPLE KNOWN AS KIN SELECTION
trainval/N4wFyRGilp4/50002 THE BAD NEWS IS THAT THIS KIN SELECTED COMPASSION IS NATURALLY CONFINED TO THE FAMILY
trainval/N4wFyRGilp4/50003 SO THERE'S STILL WORK TO BE DONE
trainval/N4wFyRGilp4/50004 SO THEY DO UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU WANT TO BE TREATED WELL YOU TREAT OTHER
trainval/N4wFyRGilp4/50005 AND IT'S GOOD TO TREAT OTHER PEOPLE WELL
trainval/N4wFyRGilp4/50006 THAT'S A NON ZERO SUM GAME
trainval/N4wFyRGilp4/50007 AND IN REAL LIFE THERE ARE LOTS OF NON ZERO SUM GAMES
trainval/N4wFyRGilp4/50008 YOU BOTH FEEL YOU'VE WON
trainval/N4wFyRGilp4/50009 IN A WAR TWO ALLIES ARE PLAYING A NON ZERO SUM GAME
trainval/N4wFyRGilp4/50010 IT'S WHY SOCIAL ORGANIZATION HAS GROWN FROM THE HUNTER GATHERER VILLAGE TO THE ANCIENT STATE THE EMPIRE AND NOW
trainval/N4wFyRGilp4/50011 AND THE STORY OF GLOBALIZATION IS LARGELY A STORY OF NON ZERO SUMNESS
trainval/N4wFyRGilp4/50012 GOOD THINGS HAPPEN AND IT'S GOOD FOR MUCH OF THE WORLD
trainval/N4wFyRGilp4/50013 THIS ISN'T ONLY ABOUT RELIGION
trainval/N4wFyRGilp4/50014 SO WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF WHAT KIND OF SIGNALS WE'RE SENDING OUT
trainval/N4wFyRGilp4/50015 SO IF YOU WANT TO TAKE A PARTICULARLY HARD CASE FOR AN AMERICAN SOMEBODY IN IRAN WHO IS
trainval/N4wFyRGilp4/50016 THAT'S A ZERO SUM GAME
trainval/n4YcornnWFI/50001 I'D HEARD ABOUT A ZEN MONASTERY WHICH IS IN ENGLAND
trainval/n4YcornnWFI/50002 ALL WE DID ALL DAY APART FROM GARDENING AND COOKING WAS HOURS AND HOURS
trainval/n4YcornnWFI/50003 AND IT SAID I AM EXTREMELY PRECIOUS I'M LIFE ITSELF
trainval/n4YcornnWFI/50004 IN EXACTLY THE WAY THAT SHE DID BECAUSE THE DIFFERENCE WAS THAT SHE REALLY MEANT IT AND THEN SHE WAITED FOR MY ANSWER AND
trainval/n4YcornnWFI/50005 RECEIVING AND GIVING IS ACTUALLY THE EXACT SAME ACTION
trainval/n4YcornnWFI/50006 AS LEONARD COHEN SAYS THERE'S A CRACK IN EVERYTHING AND THAT'S HOW THE LIGHT GETS IN
trainval/n4YcornnWFI/50007 AND THAT'S OK AND IT'S NORMAL
trainval/n4YcornnWFI/50008 IT WAS WHEN I WAS HONEST WITH MYSELF AND LET GO OF AN AGENDA AND STOP TRYING TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN THAT LOVE COULD
trainval/n4YcornnWFI/50009 OTHERWISE I WAS JUST PUSHING IT AWAY
trainval/n706Sqp20Mk/50001 FOR EXAMPLE I HAD A CHEMISTRY PROFESSOR ON THE VERY FIRST DAY OF CLASS DO AN INTENSE REACTION WITH
trainval/n706Sqp20Mk/50002 THIS REACTION WAS DONE JUST USING REGULAR TAP WATER AND SODIUM
trainval/n706Sqp20Mk/50003 THE ELECTRODE END CONSISTS OF A SINGLE STRAND OF CARBON FIBER
trainval/n706Sqp20Mk/50004 IT'S ABOUT ONE TENTH THE DIAMETER OF THE STRAND OF HUMAN HAIR
trainval/n706Sqp20Mk/50005 AND OF COURSE ONE OF MY PERSONAL FAVORITE WAYS TO INCREASE DOPAMINE {LG}
trainval/n706Sqp20Mk/50006 IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE AS EXCITING AS INVOLVING FLAMES AND EXPLOSIONS LIKE MY CHEMISTRY PROFESSOR
trainval/N7wF2AdVy2Q/50001 THE OPERA HOUSE HAD PROVIDED THE WRONG INSTRUMENT
trainval/N7wF2AdVy2Q/50002 THE AUDITORIUM WAS EMPTY
trainval/N7wF2AdVy2Q/50003 CAN YOU DO THAT
trainval/N7wF2AdVy2Q/50004 SOME OF CARSON'S UNDERGRADUATE SUBJECTS STRUGGLED WITH THAT
trainval/N7wF2AdVy2Q/50005 THESE DISTRACTIONS WERE ACTUALLY GRISTS TO THEIR CREATIVE MILL
trainval/N7wF2AdVy2Q/50007 WE FEEL THAT THEY'RE GETTING IN THE WAY
trainval/N7wF2AdVy2Q/50008 HIS NAME IS BRIAN ENO
trainval/N7wF2AdVy2Q/50009 IT'S HIS ROLE TO BE THE AWKWARD STRANGER
trainval/N7wF2AdVy2Q/50010 AND ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH HE CREATES THIS DISRUPTION IS THROUGH THIS REMARKABLE DECK OF
trainval/N7wF2AdVy2Q/50011 MAKE A SUDDEN DESTRUCTIVE UNPREDICTABLE ACTION
trainval/N7wF2AdVy2Q/50012 SO PHIL COLLINS WAS PLAYING DRUMS ON AN EARLY BRIAN ENO ALBUM
trainval/N7wF2AdVy2Q/50013 HE GOT SO FRUSTRATED HE STARTED THROWING BEER CANS ACROSS THE STUDIO
trainval/N7wF2AdVy2Q/50014 CARLOS ALOMAR GREAT ROCK GUITARIST WORKING WITH ENO ON DAVID BOWIE'S LODGER ALBUM
trainval/N7wF2AdVy2Q/50015 THEY HELP US SOLVE PROBLEMS THEY HELP US BE MORE CREATIVE
trainval/n83zdD2Y8Zc/50001 I'M NOT ADVOCATING DOING AWAY WITH THE STANDARDS
trainval/n83zdD2Y8Zc/50002 NOT WHAT KIDS SHOULD DO
trainval/n83zdD2Y8Zc/50003 WHEN WE WAIT UNTIL AFTER SCHOOL FOR THAT THEN WE ARE MISSING THE POINT THAT WE ADULTS ADOPTED IN THE FIRST
trainval/n83zdD2Y8Zc/50004 THIS IS AMERICA
trainval/n83zdD2Y8Zc/50005 YOU ARE WITH ME ON THAT RIGHT
trainval/n8eyF4UWG38/50001 SO WE STARTED AN AFTERSCHOOL FOR OUR PARENTS FOR OUR MOTHERS
trainval/N8Votwxx8a0/50001 IT'S NOT A MEASURE OF OUR WELL BEING
trainval/N8Votwxx8a0/50002 AND IT SHOULDN'T BE A GUIDE TO ALL DECISION MAKING
trainval/N8Votwxx8a0/50003 WE LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE GDP IS THE BENCHMARK OF SUCCESS IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY
trainval/N8Votwxx8a0/50004 MARKETS MOVE AND TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF CAPITAL MOVE AROUND THE WORLD BASED ON WHICH COUNTRIES ARE GOING UP
trainval/N8Votwxx8a0/50005 GDP HAS DEFINED AND SHAPED OUR LIVES FOR THE LAST 80 YEARS
trainval/N8Votwxx8a0/50006 IT'S A GOOD POINT WELL MADE
trainval/N8Votwxx8a0/50007 THERE'S A LOT OF SOCIAL PROGRESS BANG FOR YOUR GDP BUCK
trainval/N8Votwxx8a0/50008 IT'S AN AREA THE SIZE OF EUROPE 24 MILLION PEOPLE ONE OF THE MOST DEPRIVED PARTS OF THE
trainval/N8Votwxx8a0/50009 IN THE 21ST CENTURY WE FACE NEW CHALLENGES AGING OBESITY CLIMATE
trainval/N8Votwxx8a0/50010 TO FACE THOSE CHALLENGES WE NEED NEW TOOLS OF MEASUREMENT NEW WAYS OF VALUING
trainval/N8Votwxx8a0/50011 IMAGINE IF WE COULD MEASURE WHAT NONPROFITS CHARITIES VOLUNTEERS CIVIL
trainval/n8Y8FK8gonc/50001 WE HAVE LASERS WE CAN WHITEN IT OUT
trainval/n8Y8FK8gonc/50002 THIS IS COMING FROM A JEWISH GUY ALL RIGHT SO THAT MEANS A LOT
trainval/n8Y8FK8gonc/50003 AND I WENT TO HIS DEPUTY AND ASKED HIM WHAT WAS GOING ON
trainval/n8Y8FK8gonc/50004 WHERE WAS THIS GUILT TRIP COMING FROM
trainval/n8Y8FK8gonc/50005 SO WE HAD ONE GROUP THAT I HOPED THEIR PERFORMANCE WOULD BE VERY HIGH ANOTHER GROUP THAT I THOUGHT THEIR PERFORMANCE WOULD BE VERY LOW AND
trainval/n8Y8FK8gonc/50006 I WALKED WITH HIM TO HIS OFFICE
trainval/n8Y8FK8gonc/50007 HE WAS 20 SOME YEARS OLDER THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN THE SAMPLE
trainval/n8Y8FK8gonc/50008 LET'S THROW HIM OUT
trainval/n8Y8FK8gonc/50009 WOULD WE HAVE THROWN HIM OUT THEN
trainval/n8Y8FK8gonc/50010 AND I'M SURE THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALL RECOGNIZE AND WE SEE THAT IT HAPPENS
trainval/n8Y8FK8gonc/50011 MAYBE WE DON'T RECOGNIZE IT EVERY TIME BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT HAPPENS
trainval/n8Y8FK8gonc/50012 AND I THINK THE REAL CHALLENGE IS TO FIGURE OUT WHERE ARE THE CASES IN OUR LIVES WHERE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WORK ON US
trainval/n8yhaFdSGpM/50001 AND I THINK WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO NOT BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS TO TRY TO MOVE OUR INNER TRUTHS TO OUTER
trainval/n8yhaFdSGpM/50002 SO I'M TALKING HERE ABOUT OUTER TRUTH ABOUT OBJECTIVE THINGS
trainval/N9HF8mMe2pU/50001 MY MOM CAME KNOCKING ONE MORNING AND SAID RAJ PACK YOUR THINGS WE HAVE TO GO
trainval/N9HF8mMe2pU/50002 AND HELP IN THIS CASE DIDN'T COME FROM THE OUTSIDE IT ACTUALLY CAME FROM WITHIN
trainval/N9HF8mMe2pU/50003 AND SHE'S AMAZING
trainval/N9HF8mMe2pU/50004 AND THIS DISEASE WOULD SPREAD FROM ONE COMMUNITY TO ANOTHER
trainval/N9HF8mMe2pU/50005 AND THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY HERE THAT HAVE BEEN PART OF THIS CAUSE
trainval/n9yuAhusVts/50001 IN ADDITION YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR DOCTOR'S FEES AND ALL OF THESE SUBORDINATE ASSOCIATED FEES WITH THAT
trainval/n9yuAhusVts/50002 AND THAT'S NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
trainval/n9yuAhusVts/50003 THAT WAS THE BIG QUESTION HERE
trainval/n9yuAhusVts/50004 I EXPECTED I'D WALTZ INTO THAT LAB IT WOULD MAGICALLY WORK IN LIKE THE FIRST WEEK
trainval/n9yuAhusVts/50005 IT WAS TESTED IN BLIND STUDIES WITH HUMANS
trainval/n9yuAhusVts/50006 THEN THROUGH THIS I LEARNED ONE REALLY IMPORTANT LESSON THAT THROUGH THE INTERNET ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE
trainval/n9yuAhusVts/50007 IS DRIVING THE WORLD INTO LIKE THIS FREEFALL AND WE'RE GOING TO UNCLEAR AND LIKE JUST EXPLODE
trainval/n9yuAhusVts/50008 BUT IN MY OPINION WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED
trainval/n9yuAhusVts/50009 YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED IS IN THE 1970S AT THE OLYMPICS ALL THESE RECORDS HAD
trainval/n9yuAhusVts/50010 DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY
trainval/n9yuAhusVts/50011 5 BILLION PEOPLE COULD DO AND JUST IMAGINE WHAT YOU COULD DO
trainval/n9yuAhusVts/50012 ALL THESE RECORDS ARE BROKEN
trainval/n9yuAhusVts/50013 THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING NOWADAYS
trainval/n9yuAhusVts/50014 THE INTERNET IS BECOMING ACCESSIBLE TO 3
trainval/n9yuAhusVts/50015 5 BILLION MORE PEOPLE
trainval/n9yuAhusVts/50016 WHEN THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET THEY COULD BE LIKE ME
trainval/n9yuAhusVts/50017 THERE ARE MILLIONS MORE OF ME OUT THERE
trainval/NAcuH7nSdLc/50001 WOULD YOU LIKE A JOB OR WOULD YOU LIKE A FAMILY
trainval/NAcuH7nSdLc/50002 SO WHAT DO WE DO NEXT
trainval/NAcuH7nSdLc/50004 THAT WAS IT
trainval/NAcuH7nSdLc/50005 AND SO WE KIND OF SKIPPED OFF AND WE STARTED TO TELL FRIENDS AND FAMILY THAT WE WANTED TO ADOPT
trainval/NAcuH7nSdLc/50006 WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT
trainval/NAcuH7nSdLc/50007 THAT IS GOING TO BE SO HARD
trainval/NAcuH7nSdLc/50008 THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO WILL DISAPPROVE OF THIS VERY VERY STRONGLY AND YOU NEED
trainval/NAcuH7nSdLc/50009 AND HE WAS RIGHT
trainval/NAcuH7nSdLc/50010 MY PARTNER EMMA AND I GOT TO A STAGE IN OUR RELATIONSHIP WHERE WE WANTED TO START A FAMILY LIKE LOTS
trainval/NAcuH7nSdLc/50011 HE IS NOT SOME SORT OF LIFESTYLE ACCESSORY FOR ME
trainval/NAcuH7nSdLc/50012 FOR US IT WAS OUR FIRST CHOICE AND IT WAS AN EXCITING NEW BEGINNING
trainval/NAcuH7nSdLc/50013 WE WERE GIVEN HOMEWORK TO DO OUR PARENTS WERE INTERVIEWED OUR FRIENDS WERE INTERVIEWED AND IT WAS ALL
trainval/NAcuH7nSdLc/50014 WE WILL DO THOSE THINGS
trainval/NAcuH7nSdLc/50015 EMMA AND I DO THOSE THINGS
trainval/NAcuH7nSdLc/50016 STEVEN HAS LOVELY GRANDDADS HE HAS AMAZING UNCLES COUSINS
trainval/NAcuH7nSdLc/50017 WE ROPE IN THE HUSBANDS OF OUR FRIENDS AND WE ROPE IN OUR OWN MALE FRIENDS AND
trainval/NAcuH7nSdLc/50018 WE HAD LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO SAID I'M SORRY
trainval/NAcuH7nSdLc/50019 AND THAT WAS AMAZING
trainval/NAcuH7nSdLc/50020 IT WAS AMAZING FOR US BUT IT WAS INCREDIBLY POSITIVE FOR STEVEN AT THAT VERY DIFFICULT
trainval/NAcuH7nSdLc/50021 STEVEN HAS A BIRTH FAMILY AND WE HAVE CONTACT WITH THEM
trainval/NAcuH7nSdLc/50022 AND STEVEN HAS AN ADOPTIVE FAMILY AND THAT ISN'T JUST EMMA AND MYSELF IT IS
trainval/NAcuH7nSdLc/50023 HE THINKS WE'RE TOTALLY EMBARRASSING
trainval/NAcuH7nSdLc/50024 HE DOESN'T REALLY WANT TO BE SEEN OUT WITH US IN PUBLIC
trainval/NAcuH7nSdLc/50025 HE BELIEVES OUR MISSION IN LIFE IS TO NAG HIM AND TO STOP HIM FROM DOING EVERYTHING HE REALLY WANTS TO
trainval/NAkkckxE9i8/50001 IN ETHIOPIA BIRDS ARE CONSIDERED AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE ORIGIN OF MUSIC ITSELF
trainval/NAkkckxE9i8/50002 AND YARED EVENTUALLY RECOGNIZED AS SAINT YARED USED THESE SCALES TO COMPOSE FIVE VOLUMES OF
trainval/NAkkckxE9i8/50003 MUSICIAN AND NATURAL SOUNDSCAPE EXPERT BERNIE KRAUSE DESCRIBES HOW A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT HAS ANIMALS AND
trainval/NAkkckxE9i8/50004 OR HOW COULD HE
trainval/NAkkckxE9i8/50005 OR NO HE DIDN'T
trainval/NAkkckxE9i8/50006 AND THIS SCORE HAS NOT A SINGLE NOTE WRITTEN AND THERE IS NOT A SINGLE NOTE PLAYED
trainval/nAMrtHC2Ev0/50001 BUT THEY DON'T EXIST
trainval/nAMrtHC2Ev0/50002 SO I'M HAVING TO MAKE THEM
trainval/nAMrtHC2Ev0/50003 I'M WORKING WITH ARCHITECT NEIL SPILLER AT THE BARTLETT SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE AND WE'RE COLLABORATING WITH INTERNATIONAL SCIENTISTS
trainval/nAMrtHC2Ev0/50004 THIS LITTLE BAG IS ABLE TO CONDUCT ITSELF IN A WAY THAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS LIVING
trainval/nAMrtHC2Ev0/50005 IT IS ABLE TO MOVE AROUND ITS ENVIRONMENT
trainval/nAMrtHC2Ev0/50006 IF YOU WALK AROUND THE CITY OF OXFORD WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE BRICKWORK WHICH I'VE ENJOYED DOING IN THE LAST COUPLE OF
trainval/nAMrtHC2Ev0/50007 BUT IMAGINE WHAT THE PROPERTIES OF THIS LIMESTONE BLOCK MIGHT BE IF THE
trainval/nAMrtHC2Ev0/50008 THEY THINK BIG
trainval/nAMrtHC2Ev0/50009 YOU HAVE TO JUST CHOOSE YOUR SPECIES
trainval/nAMrtHC2Ev0/50010 BUT GRADUALLY AS THE BUILDINGS ARE REPAIRED WE WILL SEE THE ACCRETION OF A LIMESTONE REEF BENEATH THE
trainval/nAMrtHC2Ev0/50011 NOW WE HAVE AN ARCHITECTURE THAT CONNECTS A CITY TO THE NATURAL WORLD IN A VERY DIRECT AND
trainval/nAMrtHC2Ev0/50012 THEY CAN EXPECT TO HAVE A LOT OF FORMS AND FUNCTIONS WITHIN THE PRACTICE OF ARCHITECTURE
trainval/NaoSp4NpkGg/50001 AND IN FACT IT HAS CREATED US HAS CREATED LIFE HAS CREATED ALL THE STUFF OF LIFE
trainval/naSNfaSbOjA/50001 THERE ARE MANY FACETS THAT GO INTO ITS RADIATION TOLERANCE AND IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS TRANSFERRING ONE GENE
trainval/NbpSibMSEiE/50001 I USED TO WORK FOR A BIG COMPANY CALLED UNICAL
trainval/NbpSibMSEiE/50002 SOME OF YOU FROM THE WEST COAST MAY REMEMBER IT USED TO BE A BIG OIL AND GAS FIRM AND REFINERY
trainval/NbpSibMSEiE/50003 MANAGERS THERE WERE AFRAID OF FAILURE
trainval/NbpSibMSEiE/50004 WITH ALL THAT SUCCESS ALL THE SUDDEN I'M UNEMPLOYED
trainval/NbpSibMSEiE/50005 THERE WERE LAWSUITS IT WAS A LOT OF PAIN
trainval/NbpSibMSEiE/50006 WASN'T VERY FLATTERING I CAN TELL YOU THAT
trainval/NbpSibMSEiE/50007 WE NEED TO KEEP PUSHING THAT UP AND WE WILL PUSH IT UP
trainval/NbpSibMSEiE/50008 WE'LL GET BETTER AT THINGS WE DO
trainval/NbpSibMSEiE/50009 I HOPE SOMEDAY WE CAN HELP OUT THE UNDOCUMENTED KIDS
trainval/NbpSibMSEiE/50011 WE HAVE A FOUNDATION THAT WE GIVE MONEY AWAY
trainval/NbpSibMSEiE/50012 TODAY THOUGH YOU KNOW WE KEPT IT UP
trainval/nbYQ7kdt0U4/50001 THE WOMEN SAID THEY WOULD RATHER DELIVER ON A FLOOR THAN ON A PLASTIC SHEET THAT SMEARED BLOOD ALL OVER
trainval/nbYQ7kdt0U4/50002 THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT WOULD CAUSE MORE INFECTION
trainval/nbYQ7kdt0U4/50003 THE WOMEN WERE NEVER CONSULTED IN THIS PROCESS
trainval/nbYQ7kdt0U4/50004 THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF SIMPLE ISSUES THAT REQUIRE LOW COST INTERVENTIONS
trainval/nbYQ7kdt0U4/50005 WE HAVE FACTS TO PROVE THAT IF WE INVEST IN WOMEN AND GIRLS AND PROVIDE THEM WITH BETTER HEALTH AND WELL BEING THEY WILL
trainval/nbYQ7kdt0U4/50006 WE HAVE TO START BY BRINGING SIMPLICITY AND DIGNITY TO WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES FROM REDUCING MATERNAL MORTALITY
trainval/nbYQ7kdt0U4/50007 BUT WE NEED MORE LIGHT
trainval/nbYQ7kdt0U4/50008 IN FACT WE NEED HUGE SPOTLIGHTS PLACED IN THE WORLD OF WOMEN'S HEALTH IF WE NEED A BETTER TOMORROW
trainval/nC06omDS0kA/50001 I WAS A READER BEFORE I BECAME A WRITER
trainval/nC06omDS0kA/50002 AND OFTEN LIFE'S TRUTHS CAN BE ESTABLISHED NOT BY REASON BUT BY IMAGINATION
trainval/nC06omDS0kA/50003 AND WHY NOT
trainval/nccPghNJjBQ/50001 THIS IS MAINLY BECAUSE IT IS REQUIRED THAT EVERY STATE SENDS THIS FATAL CRASH INFORMATION TO THE FEDERAL
trainval/nccPghNJjBQ/50002 THEY REPRESENT OUR SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF ALL OUR LOVED ONES
trainval/NcPusGLnqAc/50001 HOW DID IT INCREASE IN COMPLEXITY AND WHAT WERE THE TRIGGERS FOR THIS
trainval/NcPusGLnqAc/50002 THEY HAVE THE BEST FOOD PROCESSING ABILITIES EVER
trainval/NcPusGLnqAc/50003 BUT WHAT ABOUT MY OWN SPECIALITY
trainval/NcPusGLnqAc/50004 WHY STUDY ANCIENT MOLECULES
trainval/ncwpzEoVZCk/50001 I DECIDED TO BECOME THAT BLACK SQUARE
trainval/ncwpzEoVZCk/50002 I'M SURE THAT NOW NOT ONLY DOES HE NARRATE ABOUT THE CORPSES THAT LAY BELOW BUT ALSO ABOUT THE CRAZY
trainval/ncwpzEoVZCk/50003 IN ARCHETYPES SUCH AS SIREN THE VOICES THAT LURE SAILORS TO A WATERY GRAVE OR LA
trainval/nCwwVjPNloY/50001 BUT REGARDLESS IT WAS DIFFICULT
trainval/nCwwVjPNloY/50002 EVERYTHING YOU DO IS EITHER STEEPED IN TRADITION OR HAS A PRACTICAL PURPOSE
trainval/nCwwVjPNloY/50003 YOU CAN'T SMOKE IN THE FIELD BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE AWAY YOUR POSITION
trainval/nCwwVjPNloY/50004 HOW DILIGENTLY YOU FOLLOWED THOSE RULES SPOKE VOLUMES ABOUT THE KIND OF MARINE YOU WERE
trainval/nCwwVjPNloY/50005 YOUR RANK SAID SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR HISTORY AND THE RESPECT YOU HAD EARNED
trainval/nCwwVjPNloY/50006 THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE A
trainval/nCwwVjPNloY/50007 AND I'M FRICKIN' BATMAN
trainval/nCwwVjPNloY/50008 OR FOR NOT TALKIN' BACK
trainval/nCwwVjPNloY/50009 AND NOT LIKE AFRAID RESPECT JUST LIKE RESPECT RESPECT
trainval/nCwwVjPNloY/50010 CAUSE ALL BATMAN REALLY WANTS TO DO IS SAVE PEOPLE AND MAYBE PAY ABUELA'S BILLS ONE DAY AND DIE HAPPY
trainval/nCwwVjPNloY/50011 AND MAYBE GET LIKE MAD FAMOUS FOR REAL
trainval/nCwwVjPNloY/50012 IS GONNA COME BETWEEN BATMAN
trainval/nCwwVjPNloY/50013 BUT THEY DON'T COUNT ON ME
trainval/nCwwVjPNloY/50014 BUT IT'S ALSO A SERVICE
trainval/nCwwVjPNloY/50015 AND SUDDENLY EVERYTHING GETS QUIET
trainval/nCwwVjPNloY/50016 AND THE ONE GOOD FOR NOTHING LEFT STANDING GRIPS A HANDGUN AND AIMS IT STRAIGHT UP LIKE HE'S HOLDING JESUS HOSTAGE LIKE HE'S THREATENING
trainval/nCwwVjPNloY/50017 AND HIS CHEEKS IS DRIPPIN' BUT NOT WITH SWEAT
trainval/ndAHAjgquwk/50001 IN CASE THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BIG GRAND STATEMENTS THAT WE USED TO HEAR WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER
trainval/ndAHAjgquwk/50002 IT'S HUMAN NATURE RIGHT
trainval/ndAHAjgquwk/50003 SO IT JUST MAKES SENSE THAT THE MORE PEOPLE YOU KNOW THE MORE CHANCE YOU HAVE OF YOUR NAME BEING IN THAT KIND OF
trainval/ndAHAjgquwk/50004 AND IT'S A VERY SIMPLE THING TO DO
trainval/ndAHAjgquwk/50005 I THOUGHT THIS IS GREAT
trainval/ndAHAjgquwk/50006 THIS IS REALLY GONNA WORK
trainval/ndAHAjgquwk/50007 IT'S FANTASTIC GO FOR IT
trainval/ndAHAjgquwk/50008 BUT THE BIGGEST THING I LEARNED IS YOU HAVE TO DO THE RIGHT KIND OF MARKET RESEARCH OKAY
trainval/ndAHAjgquwk/50009 WE HAVE THIS VERY LITERAL WAY OF THINKING OF WHEN I DO CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WORK I DO IT FOR CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY
trainval/ndAHAjgquwk/50010 AND THAT CAN BE MONEY OF COURSE IT CAN BE MONEY
trainval/ndAHAjgquwk/50011 I DON'T REALLY USE MY WATCH TO TELL THE TIME
trainval/ndAHAjgquwk/50012 I DO SOMETIMES BUT IT'S VERY RARE I NORMALLY USE MY MOBILE PHONE OR MY LAPTOP OR
trainval/ndAHAjgquwk/50013 AND THAT'S THE CASE FOR MOST PEOPLE NOWADAYS
trainval/ndAHAjgquwk/50014 THEY WANT SOMETHING THAT MAKES A STATEMENT
trainval/ndAHAjgquwk/50015 THAT CAN BE A FASHION STATEMENT OR IT CAN BE A STATEMENT ABOUT THE KIND OF MUSIC THEY ARE INTO OR PERHAPS A STATEMENT ABOUT HOW MUCH
trainval/NdKEy6vcCMw/50001 YOU DON'T SEE WITH YOU EYES YOU PERCEIVE WITH YOU MIND
trainval/NdKEy6vcCMw/50002 HOW CAN I KEEP THEM WHEN I DIE
trainval/NdKEy6vcCMw/50003 AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME ENOUGH TWEETS WILL CAUSE SOMETHING TO TREND
trainval/NdKEy6vcCMw/50004 BECAUSE THE BRAIN ACTUALLY ISN'T FULLY MATURE UNTIL AROUND THE AGE 25
trainval/NdKEy6vcCMw/50005 THE OPPOSITE OF MINDFUL IS MIND EMPTY
trainval/NdKEy6vcCMw/50006 BUT WHEN YOU'RE MINDFUL OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN YOUR BODY AND EXTERNALLY AND IT CAN HELP MAYBE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO BRING THE
trainval/NdKEy6vcCMw/50007 IF YOU'RE BREAKING UP WITH SOMEONE TAKE THEIR NUMBER OUT OF YOUR PHONE OR TELL YOUR FRIENDS
trainval/NdKEy6vcCMw/50008 THEY'RE GOING TO MESS IT UP
trainval/NdKEy6vcCMw/50009 SO THE QUESTION STILL EXISTS
trainval/NdKEy6vcCMw/50010 CARL SAGAN SAID THAT WE ARE THE COSMOS' WAY FOR TO KNOW ITSELF
trainval/NdKEy6vcCMw/50012 DOES A BEE HAVE IT
trainval/NDQ1Mi5I4rg/50001 SO I PUT MY BACKPACK DOWN AND WALKED THE PASSAGE THAT RAN THROUGH TO WHERE THE HEART OF OUR HOME MY FATHER LAY DYING OF
trainval/NDQ1Mi5I4rg/50002 BUT NOT JUST ANY STEPS THE RIGHT STEPS FOR US
trainval/NDQ1Mi5I4rg/50003 WHEN WE ARE OPEN TO THE DIFFICULT EMOTIONS WE ARE ABLE TO GENERATE RESPONSES THAT ARE VALUES ALIGNED
trainval/NDWkSrKRTCs/50002 WE GET THEM AN EDUCATION
trainval/NDWkSrKRTCs/50003 IT'S JUST ABOUT EMPOWERING AND HELPING WOMEN
trainval/NDWkSrKRTCs/50004 HOW I GOT HERE
trainval/NDWkSrKRTCs/50005 WHY DID YOU MAKE ME DO THAT
trainval/NDWkSrKRTCs/50007 I'D NEVER SEEN THAT FEAR BEFORE
trainval/NDWkSrKRTCs/50008 IT WASN'T HIS CHILD
trainval/NDWkSrKRTCs/50012 I WASN'T GOING TO HURT ANYONE
trainval/NDWkSrKRTCs/50014 AT THAT MOMENT I KNEW I NEEDED TO GET OUT
trainval/NDWkSrKRTCs/50015 ENOUGH WAS ENOUGH
trainval/NDWkSrKRTCs/50017 BECAUSE I WAS BEING ABUSED
trainval/NDWkSrKRTCs/50018 MY DAUGHTER WENT THROUGH A LONG COURT CASE AND WE WERE ONE GREAT UNITED FAMILY
trainval/NDWkSrKRTCs/50019 LOOK IN THE BATHROOM
trainval/NDWkSrKRTCs/50021 WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT THAT COULD HAPPEN
trainval/NDWkSrKRTCs/50022 BUT IT CAN HAPPEN
trainval/nFEgRt2EH1g/50001 IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO BETTER
trainval/nFEgRt2EH1g/50002 THE DUST STOPS THE VISIBLE LIGHT FROM GETTING TO US
trainval/nFEgRt2EH1g/50003 THE DUST STOPS IT GETTING TO US
trainval/nFEgRt2EH1g/50004 I WANTED TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE
trainval/nFEgRt2EH1g/50005 I WANTED TO SEE EVERYTHING THAT THE UNIVERSE HAD TO OFFER
trainval/nFEgRt2EH1g/50006 THE SAME THING HAPPENS WITH LIGHT
trainval/nFEgRt2EH1g/50008 THIS IMAGE IS ALSO BLACK AND WHITE SO WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT IS THE COLOR OF EVERYTHING IN HERE
trainval/nFEgRt2EH1g/50009 WE KNOW THAT THERE MUST BE A LOT OF HIGH ENERGY ELECTRONS IN THE PLANE TO PRODUCE THE SYNCHROTRON
trainval/nFEgRt2EH1g/50010 WELL VERY WELL SO WE'VE SEEN ONE RADIO GALAXY
trainval/nFEgRt2EH1g/50011 AND I'M VERY EXCITED
trainval/nFEgRt2EH1g/50012 EVERYWHERE IT PERVADES US LIKE THE FORCE
trainval/nFQU5a5SByg/50002 WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THEY'RE CREATING A SHARED SPACE
trainval/nFQU5a5SByg/50003 THEY'VE EXPLORED IT IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS
trainval/nFQU5a5SByg/50004 SO HERE WE ARE
trainval/nFQU5a5SByg/50006 AND THIS ONE IS MY FAVORITE
trainval/nFQU5a5SByg/50007 AND I WAS UPSTAIRS
trainval/nFQU5a5SByg/50008 HOW CAN WE GO WITH THIS ENERGY
trainval/nFQU5a5SByg/50009 AND THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN ENCOURAGE THEM TO DEVELOP THEIR IDEAS STAY CURIOUS
trainval/nFSdHdNOgSA/50001 I WANTED TO REVENGE FOR MY VILLAGE
trainval/nFSdHdNOgSA/50002 I WAS READY TO EAT
trainval/nFSdHdNOgSA/50003 I KNOW IT'S A SHAME
trainval/nFSdHdNOgSA/50004 BUT WHO IS TO BE BLAMED
trainval/nFSdHdNOgSA/50005 I THOUGHT I WAS FAMOUS ENOUGH THAT I WOULD RAISE THE MONEY WITHIN ONE MONTH BUT I'VE BEEN HUMBLED
trainval/nFSdHdNOgSA/50007 THEY WILL DIE SOON
trainval/nFSdHdNOgSA/50008 ONE OF THEM HAPPENED TO BE ME NOW
trainval/nFSdHdNOgSA/50009 SO WE PARTY AND DANCE TO THEIR MUSIC
trainval/nG1oCU0ijP0/50001 I'VE ALWAYS BEEN FASCINATED BY RIGHT AND WRONG
trainval/ng7sf2SpeFg/50001 IT'S ALSO A VERY VERY USEFUL LIFE SKILL
trainval/ng7sf2SpeFg/50002 AND ENCOURAGES CREATIVITY
trainval/ng7sf2SpeFg/50003 AND GET ON WITH IT
trainval/ng7sf2SpeFg/50004 MOST TEACHERS DON'T KNOW HOW TO CODE
trainval/ng7sf2SpeFg/50005 SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE OUR PROGRESS IN THE FUTURE
trainval/ng7sf2SpeFg/50006 WELL THIS IS WHERE MY PERSONAL STORY STARTS
trainval/ng7sf2SpeFg/50007 EACH ONE CREATES A TOY AN ANIMATION OR A GAME
trainval/ng7sf2SpeFg/50008 AND WE ASKED EACH SCHOOL TO GIVE US FEEDBACK AT END OF EACH PROJECT SO WE COULD REFINE THEM AND MAKE THEM
trainval/ng7sf2SpeFg/50009 WE ASKED THE KIDS TO RATE THE PROJECTS
trainval/ng7sf2SpeFg/50010 BORING TO 100
trainval/ng7sf2SpeFg/50011 WE WILL HAVE ABOUT 20 CLUBS BY THE END OF THE YEAR
trainval/ng7sf2SpeFg/50013 AND THEY'LL BRING WITH THEM THE KNOWLEDGE THAT CODE LITERACY IS AN IMPORTANT SKILL
trainval/ng7sf2SpeFg/50014 SO WHILE THESE 300 SOUNDS LIKE A BIG NUMBER IT'S ACTUALLY ONLY 1
trainval/NgbqXsA62Qs/50001 SIMILAR DATA HAS BEEN AROUND FOR QUITE SOME TIME
trainval/NgbqXsA62Qs/50002 HOW ARE THEY ORGANIZED
trainval/NgDGlcxYrhQ/50001 WE MADE AGLOE NEW YORK UP
trainval/NgDGlcxYrhQ/50002 IT IS A FAKE PLACE
trainval/NgDGlcxYrhQ/50003 IT'S A PAPER TOWN
trainval/NgDGlcxYrhQ/50004 THE WAY THAT WE CHOOSE SORT OF OUR PERSONAL CARTOGRAPHIC ENTERPRISE ALSO SHAPES THE
trainval/NgDGlcxYrhQ/50005 I BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE MAP CHANGES THE LIFE WE LEAD
trainval/NgDGlcxYrhQ/50006 YOU VERY RARELY GO TO A PLACE THAT ISN'T ON YOUR PERSONAL MAP
trainval/NgDGlcxYrhQ/50007 SO I WAS A REALLY TERRIBLE STUDENT WHEN I WAS A KID
trainval/NgDGlcxYrhQ/50008 THEY LITERALLY PUT NOOSES ON THEMSELVES AND THEN THEY WENT OFF TO THEIR JOBS WHATEVER THEY WERE
trainval/NgDGlcxYrhQ/50009 THESE PEOPLE IN MY SYMBOL OBSESSED TWELVE YEAR OLD IMAGINATION THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE STRANGLING
trainval/NgDGlcxYrhQ/50010 THAT'S A TERRIBLE END
trainval/NgDGlcxYrhQ/50011 AND SO I STARTED TO LEARN BECAUSE LEARNING WAS COOL
trainval/NgDGlcxYrhQ/50012 IT'S ABOUT CARTOGRAPHY
trainval/NgDGlcxYrhQ/50013 WHAT IS THE PROCESS OF CARTOGRAPHY
trainval/NgDGlcxYrhQ/50014 AND THAT'S WHEN LEARNING REALLY BEGAN FOR ME
trainval/NgDGlcxYrhQ/50015 IT'S TRUE THAT I HAD TEACHERS THAT DIDN'T GIVE UP ON ME AND I WAS VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE THOSE TEACHERS BECAUSE I OFTEN GAVE
trainval/NgDGlcxYrhQ/50016 AND I SAID I DON'T KNOW LIKE SIX HOURS
trainval/NgDGlcxYrhQ/50017 AND HE SAID DO YOU REALIZE THAT IF YOU'D WORKED AT BASKIN ROBBINS THOSE SIX HOURS YOU COULD HAVE MADE 30
trainval/NgDGlcxYrhQ/50018 IT WAS SPOTTY IT WAS INCONSISTENT THERE WAS A LOT I DIDN'T KNOW
trainval/NgDGlcxYrhQ/50020 BUT THE GREAT THING ABOUT IMAGINING LEARNING AS CARTOGRAPHY INSTEAD OF IMAGINING IT AS ARBITRARY HURDLES THAT YOU HAVE TO JUMP
trainval/NgDGlcxYrhQ/50021 SO I HAD ONE LEARNING COMMUNITY IN HIGH SCHOOL THEN I WENT TO ANOTHER FOR COLLEGE AND THEN I WENT TO ANOTHER WHEN I
trainval/NgDGlcxYrhQ/50022 TODAY'S QUESTION IS WHY
trainval/NgDGlcxYrhQ/50023 AND BECAUSE THE YOUTUBE PAGE IS SET UP SO THAT THE PAGE IN WHICH I'M TALKING TO YOU IS ON THE EXACT
trainval/NgDGlcxYrhQ/50024 THEY EXIST IN CORNERS OF THE INTERNET WHERE OLD MEN FEAR TO TREAD
trainval/NgVwPj54TEo/50001 HE WASN'T EVEN SICK
trainval/NhmybGS7FLA/50002 WE ARE VERY WELCOMING AND JUST LIKE THE UNITED STATES VENEZUELA IS A COUNTRY OF
trainval/NhmybGS7FLA/50003 THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS ALSO COLLAPSING
trainval/NhmybGS7FLA/50004 AND THE SHORTAGE OF MEDICINE AND BASIC CARE SUPPLIES ARE THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE
trainval/NhmybGS7FLA/50005 MY PLAN OF COMING TO THE UNITED STATES TO PURSUE GRADUATE STUDIES AT UCLA BECAME MY TICKET TO ESCAPE THE
trainval/NhmybGS7FLA/50006 IN 2014 24 YEAR OLD BASSIL DA COSTA HAD NEVER BEEN TO ONE OF THESE PROTESTS BEFORE
trainval/NhmybGS7FLA/50008 I FELT THE SAME INTENSE CALL FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AT THE MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR HEATHER WHEN HER MOTHER
trainval/NhmybGS7FLA/50009 BUT I'M HERE WITH A MESSAGE OF HOPE
trainval/NhmybGS7FLA/50010 BUT WITH THE LOVE AND SUPPORT OF MY LOCAL COMMUNITY WHO GAVE ME AND MY BUSINESS A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE I
trainval/nhrZHRqUaT0/50001 WHERE I WORK WE ALSO HAVE A TEAM OF EDITORS BUT WE ALSO RELY HEAVILY ON OTHER TOOLS
trainval/NhSTVcNFtVI/50001 ONE HOT OCTOBER MORNING I GOT OFF THE ALL NIGHT TRAIN IN
trainval/nHU9aLPyxf0/50001 LET'S DO SOMETHING
trainval/nHU9aLPyxf0/50002 I'VE BEEN IN PRISON ONLY ONCE IN MY LIFE BEFORE
trainval/nHU9aLPyxf0/50003 THE MAYOR BOURGMESTRE WAS ASKED WHAT HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT
trainval/nHU9aLPyxf0/50004 THE METRO IN BRUSSELS NOT IN PARIS WERE SHUT DOWN FOR FIVE FULL DAYS
trainval/Nhwq12TKkQQ/50001 I AM NOT ALONE MY SITUATION ISN'T UNIQUE OR EVEN SPECIAL
trainval/Nhwq12TKkQQ/50002 HE WAS ALSO HER BROTHER WHICH WAS NORMAL AT THE TIME
trainval/Nhwq12TKkQQ/50003 EGYPT WAS FACING A LOT OF TROUBLE DURING THIS ERA
trainval/Nhwq12TKkQQ/50004 CAESAR IS THE HEAD OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE AND THEY FORM AN ALLIANCE
trainval/Nhwq12TKkQQ/50005 SO SHE DECIDES TO FORM AN ALLIANCE WITH MARK ANTONY
trainval/Nhwq12TKkQQ/50006 CLEOPATRA AND MARK ANTONY REUNITE AND AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY ARE BOTH DEAD BY THEIR OWN HANDS
trainval/Nhwq12TKkQQ/50007 YOU'RE MAYBE THINKING TO YOURSELF
trainval/Nhwq12TKkQQ/50008 AND SINCE I AM ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS THAT PEOPLE THINK I'M UPTIGHT THIS WAS THE PERFECT POSTER FOR ME
trainval/Nhwq12TKkQQ/50009 SO I PUT IT UP IN PROCTOR AND I LEFT IT HOPING THAT EVERYONE WOULD ENJOY IT JUST AS MUCH AS I DID
trainval/Nhwq12TKkQQ/50010 WE DO THIS ALL THE TIME WE TALK ABOUT CLEOPATRA AS THIS HOT VIXEN
trainval/Nhwq12TKkQQ/50011 AND EVEN TODAY MAYBE LAST WEEK IF YOU WANTED TO DRESS UP AS CLEOPATRA FOR HALLOWEEN YOU COULD HAVE
trainval/Nhwq12TKkQQ/50012 THERE'S DEFINITELY AN EMPOWERING WAY TO DO IT BUT WHEN ALL THE IMAGES OF POWERFUL WOMEN FROM HISTORY LOOK LIKE THIS
trainval/Nhwq12TKkQQ/50013 THIS IS A POWERFUL WOMAN AN INDIVIDUAL
trainval/Nhwq12TKkQQ/50014 AND IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THIS IDENTITY SHE HAD TO DESEXUALIZE HERSELF
trainval/Nhwq12TKkQQ/50015 THAT WAS THE WAY THAT SHE SAW OUT OF MARRIAGE AND TOWARDS SOLO RULE
trainval/Nhwq12TKkQQ/50016 I DO IT A LOT TOO SO PLEASE FORGIVE ME BUT IT'S STRANGE BECAUSE WE DON'T CALL OBAMA
trainval/Nhwq12TKkQQ/50017 WE WOULD NEVER CALL REAGAN RONALD
trainval/Nhwq12TKkQQ/50018 SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN DO THE SAME FOR THIS TALK
trainval/Nhwq12TKkQQ/50019 THIS TALK IS ABOUT WOMEN IN POWER SO ASSUME THAT WHEN I SAY CLINTON I'M TALKING ABOUT HILARY CLINTON
trainval/Nhwq12TKkQQ/50020 IS HER HAIR PULLED BACK
trainval/Nhwq12TKkQQ/50021 BUT LET ME TELL YOU
trainval/Nhwq12TKkQQ/50022 NO YOUNG WOMEN SHOULD BE RUNNING THE COUNTRY
trainval/Nhwq12TKkQQ/50023 IF ANYTHING WHEN A WOMAN WEARS A SKIRT AND A BLAZER IT SHOULD BE A SKIRT SUIT I'LL GRANT
trainval/Nhwq12TKkQQ/50024 WE'RE AFRAID OF PUSHING BOUNDARIES OF CHALLENGING THE STATUS QUO OF STANDING UP TO GENDER
trainval/Nhwq12TKkQQ/50025 IT MAKES ME WANT TO PACK UP MY POWER SUIT AND GO HOME IT MAKES ME WANT TO GIVE UP
trainval/Nhx1SyXMwCg/50001 BUT DOES IT JUST HAPPEN OVER THERE
trainval/Nhx1SyXMwCg/50002 PERHAPS YOU SAW THE FILM THE HOLLYWOOD FILM BLOOD DIAMOND THE ONE WITH LEONARDO DICAPRIO
trainval/Nhx1SyXMwCg/50003 SAPARMURAT NIYAZOV HE WAS ONE OF THEM
trainval/Nhx1SyXMwCg/50004 WELL SOME OF THAT SPRANG FROM OUR WORK
trainval/Nhx1SyXMwCg/50005 UNTIL HIS DEATH IN 2006 HE WAS THE ALL POWERFUL LEADER OF TURKMENISTAN A CENTRAL ASIAN
trainval/Nhx1SyXMwCg/50006 HE USED ONE TO BUY THE PROPERTY AND ANOTHER WHICH WAS IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S NAME TO PAY THE HUGE BILLS
trainval/Nhx1SyXMwCg/50007 IN 2011 NATURAL RESOURCE EXPORTS OUTWEIGHED AID FLOWS BY
trainval/Nhx1SyXMwCg/50008 NOW LET'S GO BACK TO THE OIL AND MINING COMPANIES AND LET'S GO BACK TO DAN ETETE AND THAT 1 BILLION DEAL
trainval/Nhx1SyXMwCg/50009 IN THE OIL AND MINING SECTOR FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS NOW THE BEGINNING OF A TRULY WORLDWIDE
trainval/Nhx1SyXMwCg/50010 SO THIS IS CHANGE HAPPENING
trainval/Nhx1SyXMwCg/50011 WELL WE'VE ALL HEARD ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE I THINK AND WE ALL KNOW THEY'RE USED QUITE A BIT BY
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50001 I MAKE THEM STAND AT ATTENTION LIKE A SOLDIER
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50002 NO SLOUCHING NO PANTS HANGING DOWN NONE OF THAT STUFF
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50004 AND SO I PLAY A LITTLE GAME WITH THEM BEFORE I MAKE THEM STAND AT ATTENTION
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50005 IT MEANS EVERYBODY BE QUIET AND PAY ATTENTION
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50006 DO YOU UNDERSTAND
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50007 EVERYBODY START CHATTING
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50008 WE TEACH THEM HOW TO GO RIGHT FACE LEFT FACE SO THEY CAN OBEY INSTRUCTIONS AND KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT OBEYING
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50009 IT GIVES THEM STRUCTURE
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50010 I'M YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50011 I'M YOUR DADDY AND YOUR MOMMY
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50012 BUT SIR NO DON'T TELL ME HOW OFTEN YOU SCRAPED YOUR FACE THIS MORNING
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50013 NO EXCUSE SIR
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50014 ATTABOY YOU'RE LEARNING FAST
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50015 THEY COME TO RESPECT HIM
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50016 AND SO WE NEED MORE OF THIS KIND OF STRUCTURE AND RESPECT IN THE LIVES OF OUR CHILDREN
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50017 I SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH YOUTH GROUPS AND I SAY TO PEOPLE WHEN DOES THE EDUCATION PROCESS BEGIN
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50018 WE'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT LET'S FIX THE SCHOOLS
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50019 LET'S DO MORE FOR OUR TEACHERS
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50020 IT'S PART OF THE ANSWER
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50021 DOES IT BEGIN IN FIRST GRADE
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50022 THAT'S WHEN LOVE BEGINS
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50023 THAT'S WHEN STRUCTURE BEGINS
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50024 THIS IS EASY
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50025 AND SO MY WHOLE LIFE THEN WAS DEDICATED TO ROTC AND THE MILITARY
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50026 THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50027 AND THAT'S WHAT I FOUND
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50029 AND I ALSO HAD THIS EXTENDED NETWORK
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50030 CHILDREN NEED A NETWORK
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50032 THEY KEPT US IN PLAY
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50033 AND THEN YOU CAN SUPPORT US
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50034 THAT'S THE ROLE OF YOU GUYS
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50035 WE'RE INVESTING IN OUR FUTURE
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50036 EVERY NATION TOUCHES US
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50037 THAT'S WHY WE NEED SOUND IMMIGRATION POLICY
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50038 I EVEN DID IT WHEN I WAS SECRETARY OF STATE
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50039 I SEE YOU ON TELEVISION
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50040 AMERICA HAS PAID ME
trainval/NhYnouvrGS8/50041 BUT NOW I'M ALONE
trainval/NI0yARyFoIM/50001 THAT'S HOW I WAS EXPRESSING MYSELF
trainval/NI0yARyFoIM/50002 SO LET'S TALK ABOUT TECHNICALITIES
trainval/NI0yARyFoIM/50003 GENDER IDENTITY IS WHAT YOU IDENTIFY AS
trainval/NI0yARyFoIM/50004 AS I'VE TOLD YOU I IDENTIFY AS MALE
trainval/NI0yARyFoIM/50005 SO HOW CAN WE SPREAD AWARENESS
trainval/NI0yARyFoIM/50006 BUT THEY GOT IT WRONG
trainval/NI0yARyFoIM/50007 HOW CAN WE MAKE IT MORE POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT PEOPLE LIKE ME INTO THEIR
trainval/NI0yARyFoIM/50008 PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME
trainval/NI0yARyFoIM/50009 I AM MALE I IDENTIFY ENTIRELY AS MALE AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN MALE
trainval/NI0yARyFoIM/50010 THAT UNCERTAINTY KEPT ME WITHIN MY SHELL AND IT KEPT ME HIDING AWAY FROM WHO I AM
trainval/NI0yARyFoIM/50011 SELF DISCOVERY IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT THING THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S NOT ENFORCED MORE INTO
trainval/NI0yARyFoIM/50012 HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THIS PERSON TO GO FROM BEING SAMANTHA KATE HOBMAN TO BEING CHARLES FRANCIS
trainval/NI0yARyFoIM/50013 WHAT CAN CHANGE PEOPLE'S OUTLOOK ON US
trainval/NI0yARyFoIM/50014 IT IS A WHOLE ENTIRE SPECTRUM
trainval/niASMK9RoAI/50001 SO WE STARTED TAKING THESE GROUPS
trainval/NIjjaFCADSE/50001 WHY DIDN'T THEY USE HORSES IN AFGHANISTAN
trainval/NIjjaFCADSE/50002 AND OF COURSE THEY SHOULD HAVE
trainval/NIjjaFCADSE/50003 WELL MY ANSWER IS
trainval/NIjjaFCADSE/50004 SO I'M NOW A PROFESSOR IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING BUT I ACTUALLY STARTED MY SCIENTIFIC CAREER IN A VETERINARY
trainval/NIjjaFCADSE/50005 OF COURSE WE CAN'T REDESIGN HUMAN LEGS BUT WE CAN ATTACH EXTRA TENDONS ON THE OUTSIDE
trainval/NIjjaFCADSE/50006 BOTH OF THESE PROBLEMS CAN BE SOLVED BY ROBOTICS
trainval/NIjjaFCADSE/50007 SO THERE'S NO MECHANICAL COUPLING THERE'S ONLY AN ELECTRICAL COUPLING
trainval/NIjjaFCADSE/50008 AND WE CAN EVEN IMPROVE ON NATURE BY USING THOSE SAME PRINCIPLES IN NEW WAYS THAT NATURE
trainval/NiKtZgImdlY/50001 SILENCE IS KATRINA
trainval/NiKtZgImdlY/50002 I WILL ASK THAT HOMELESS MAN WHAT HIS NAME IS AND HOW HIS DAY WAS BECAUSE SOMETIMES ALL PEOPLE WANT TO BE IS
trainval/NiMgOklgeos/50001 I WAS MADE OF FLESH BUT I WASN'T PINK
trainval/NiMgOklgeos/50002 THAT REMAINS A COMMON PRACTICE WORLDWIDE AND THAT WILL NOT
trainval/NiMgOklgeos/50003 I'M A DOMINICAN DUTCH I GREW UP IN A MIXED FAMILY AND I'M A BISEXUAL WOMAN
trainval/nItwVO9stX8/50001 AND YES QATAR WANTS TO BE A MODERN NATION
trainval/nItwVO9stX8/50002 AND THEREFORE TRADITION BECOMES MORE IMPORTANT NOT LESS IMPORTANT
trainval/nItwVO9stX8/50003 WE'RE TRYING TO BE PART OF THIS GLOBAL VILLAGE BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE REVISING OURSELVES THROUGH OUR
trainval/nItwVO9stX8/50004 WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE WHAT THERE IS IN THE WEST
trainval/nItwVO9stX8/50005 WE DON'T WANT THEIR COLLECTIONS
trainval/nItwVO9stX8/50006 WE WANT TO BUILD OUR OWN IDENTITIES OUR OWN FABRIC CREATE AN OPEN DIALOGUE SO THAT WE SHARE OUR
trainval/nItwVO9stX8/50007 WE DO HAVE ARTISTS BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE NOT DISCOVERED THEM YET
trainval/nItwVO9stX8/50008 WE SHOULD NOT UNDERESTIMATE IT
trainval/NJ9Iq7ReMDs/50001 POVERTY HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS NOT ONLY EXIST IN ETHIOPIA OR KENYA BUT YOU
trainval/NJ9Iq7ReMDs/50002 LITTLE DID I KNOW THAT AT 9 YEARS OLD A COMMON EAR INFECTION WOULD CHANGE MY WHOLE PERSPECTIVE ON LIFE
trainval/NJ9Iq7ReMDs/50003 THINK ABOUT IT
trainval/NJ9Iq7ReMDs/50004 ANYONE HERE WHO HAS DONATED THEIR TIME OR THEIR ENERGY TO A GOOD CAUSE REMEMBERS HOW WONDERFUL IT FELT TO BE A
trainval/NJ9Iq7ReMDs/50005 IMAGINE WALKING DOWN REN L VESQUE BOULEVARD AND SEEING HOMELESS MEN HUDDLED TOGETHER TRYING TO STAY WARM IN THE
trainval/njESlZa2b10/50001 HAVE YOU MET MY EX
trainval/njESlZa2b10/50002 AND SO I HAD THIS BRILLIANT PLAN FOR THE MIDTERM
trainval/NjpXs8Ymr14/50001 BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS THAT WAY
trainval/NjpXs8Ymr14/50002 ERIC ACTUALLY DIDN'T START OUT IN BIOLOGY
trainval/NjpXs8Ymr14/50003 HE GOT HIS MASTER'S DEGREE IN PURE MATHEMATICS
trainval/NjpXs8Ymr14/50004 SO WHEN HE DECIDED TO GO BACK AND GET HIS DOCTORATE IN BIOMATHEMATICS HE ALREADY
trainval/NjpXs8Ymr14/50005 LITERALLY TENURED PROFESSORS AT IVY LEAGUE UNIVERSITIES WOULD STORM OUT OF HIS LECTURES AND SAY DON'T
trainval/NjpXs8Ymr14/50006 HE'S BEEN PROFILED IN THE NEW YORK TIMES HE'S BEEN WRITTEN UP TWICE IN ESQUIRE
trainval/NjpXs8Ymr14/50007 BUT WHAT THIS TEACHES US IS THAT REAL INNOVATION VERY RARELY
trainval/NjpXs8Ymr14/50008 HE'S A JOURNALIST
trainval/NjpXs8Ymr14/50009 SHE WENT TO COLLEGE AND SHE STUDIED DEVELOPMENT AND SHE GOT A JOB WORKING IN NGOS AFTER SHE
trainval/NjpXs8Ymr14/50010 AND THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE
trainval/NjpXs8Ymr14/50011 ISN'T THERE ANY EASIER WAY
trainval/NjpXs8Ymr14/50012 SOME ARE GOVERNED BY THEIR HEART THEIR PASSION
trainval/NjpXs8Ymr14/50013 WE CAN ALL UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THAT
trainval/njVJz0wZUfI/50001 WELL ONCE I HAD A TASTE OF FEEDBACK I REALIZED I WANTED MORE BECAUSE IF I HAD ONE WAY OF BEING THAT WASN'T
trainval/njVJz0wZUfI/50002 SO I TOOK THIS ASSESSMENT CALLED THE EQ PROFILE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THE EQ PROFILE DOES IS IT
trainval/njVJz0wZUfI/50003 SO THIS IS HOW IT SHOWS UP FOR ME
trainval/njVJz0wZUfI/50004 THEY TOLD HIM
trainval/njVJz0wZUfI/50005 DON'T QUIT YOUR DAY JOB
trainval/njVJz0wZUfI/50006 UNFORTUNATE ASSUMPTION NUMBER ONE IS
trainval/nLB8ASSQdHc/50001 AND ONE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO SPEND LESS TIME IN THE SHOWER
trainval/nLB8ASSQdHc/50002 AND IT WORKED
trainval/nLB8ASSQdHc/50003 HUNDREDS OF ORGANIZATIONS DOWNLOADED THE TOOLKIT
trainval/nLB8ASSQdHc/50004 WHAT'S SO AMAZING ABOUT THE MARINA BARRAGE IS THAT IT HAS BEEN BUILT TO MAKE THE MAXIMUM USE OF ITS LARGE
trainval/nLeeTVmVrtA/50001 MY GOAL WAS TO FIND A DUSTY PIECE OF BREAD IN THE TRASH
trainval/nLeeTVmVrtA/50002 I WAS FOUR YEARS OLD
trainval/nLotSkXFSUg/50001 SWEET SWEET I AM SO SWEET
trainval/nLotSkXFSUg/50002 FOR OTHERS THEY APPEAR TO BE PONDERING THE WOES OF THE WORLD
trainval/nLotSkXFSUg/50003 THEY REALLY AREN'T
trainval/nLotSkXFSUg/50004 WHAT THEY'RE SAYING TENDS TO BE PRETTY MUNDANE
trainval/nLotSkXFSUg/50005 THEY KNOW EACH OTHER BY VOICE
trainval/nLotSkXFSUg/50006 GALS YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER
trainval/nLtUl2CP8ak/50001 I MADE A PROJECT FOR TED
trainval/nLtUl2CP8ak/50002 WE CAN SWITCH THEM OFF
trainval/nLtUl2CP8ak/50003 DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO WITH THAT XBOX
trainval/nLtUl2CP8ak/50004 MAYBE THEY CAN
trainval/nLtUl2CP8ak/50005 THOSE GIRLS ARE REALLY NICE
trainval/NlzanAw0RP4/50001 IT COMES FROM THE BRAIN NOT FROM THE WORKS OF ART
trainval/NMBNZspmn7I/50001 SO WE SEE THAT DEFINING REALITY IS NOT SO EASY
trainval/NMBNZspmn7I/50002 AND WHAT ABOUT OUR SKY
trainval/NMBNZspmn7I/50003 BUT WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING THE PHENOMENON NOT EVEN THIS FIRST STEP SCIENTISTS
trainval/NMfXycr7SOU/50001 SO WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THERE'S MUCH MORE WARMING COMING THAT THERE'S MUCH MORE WARMING IN THE PIPELINE
trainval/NMfXycr7SOU/50002 NOW YOU MIGHT ASK THAT IF THERE IS STILL TIME BEFORE CATASTROPHIC HARM MATERIALIZES
trainval/NMfXycr7SOU/50003 NOW IT WILL TAKE A GLOBAL PACK OF LAWYERS AND A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR LEGAL ACTION FROM YOU
trainval/NMQGa6grfeE/50001 AND WHY SHOULD IT
trainval/NMQGa6grfeE/50003 THE PROBLEM WELL OUR GOALS AREN'T SPECIFIC IT'S THAT IT'S ALL TOO EASY TO CONVINCE OURSELVES THAT WE'RE GETTING
trainval/NMQGa6grfeE/50004 THEN AT THE OTHER END OF THE JOURNEY IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO TRULY SAVOUR THE ATTAINMENT OF YOUR DEFINED GOALS
trainval/NMQGa6grfeE/50005 WELL I HELPED TO ADMINISTER LARGE SCALED TRIALS COMPARING THE EFFECTIVE TALKING
trainval/NMQGa6grfeE/50006 IT WILL BECOME EVIDENT
trainval/nmVDcD2olOA/50001 ANY TYPE OF SUPPLIES THAT THEY WANT AND IT ENDS UP ON THEIR FRONT DOOR STEP
trainval/nmVDcD2olOA/50002 WE ARE A FOR PURPOSE COMPANY
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50001 HOW MANY OF YOU IN THE LAST 24 HOURS THINK BACK HAVE TOLD A LITTLE FIB OR A BIG ONE
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50002 HOW ABOUT FACEBOOK ITSELF
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50003 YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS THINK THAT HEY THERE ARE THESE IDEALIZED VERSIONS PEOPLE ARE JUST SHOWING THE BEST THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THEIR LIVES
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50004 I'VE THOUGHT THAT MANY TIMES
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50005 MY FRIENDS NO WAY THEY CAN BE THAT COOL AND HAVE GOOD OF A LIFE
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50006 WELL ONE STUDY TESTED THIS BY EXAMINING PEOPLE'S PERSONALITIES
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50007 WE EMAIL WE TEXT WE SKYPE WE FACEBOOK
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50008 WE'RE THINKING ABOUT GOING ON OUR WAY
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50009 HERE'S THE LAST ONE YOU'RE TALKING TO SOMEBODY AND YOU SAY SORRY GOT WORK GOTTA GO
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50010 THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE SAYING LOOK I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU NOW OR I DIDN'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU THEN BUT I STILL CARE ABOUT YOU
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50011 THE SOCK PUPPET ISN'T ABOUT AMBIGUITY PER SE
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50013 HERE'S ONE OF HIS BESTSELLING BOOKS
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50015 IT COULD BE REVIEWS
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50016 IT COULD BE PROPAGANDA
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50017 THE GOVERNMENT HIRES THESE PEOPLE COMPANIES HIRE THEM ALL OVER THE PLACE
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50018 THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT IT
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50019 NOW LET'S PUT ASIDE THE ONLINE ANONYMOUS SEX CHATROOMS WHICH I'M SURE NONE OF YOU HAVE BEEN IN
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50020 I CAN ASSURE YOU THERE'S DECEPTION THERE
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50021 THEY SAID HOW BIG THE BATHROOM WAS OR THEY SAID
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50022 THEY ARE CLUSTERING PRETTY CLOSE TO THE TRUTH
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50023 ONE OF THE REASONS IS PRETTY SIMPLE
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50024 THEY WERE CONSTRAINED
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50025 WELL WHAT EXPLAINS ALL THESE STUDIES
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50026 THAT REALLY IS STRANGE
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50027 IT'S BEEN REVIEWED MANY TIMES
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50028 THE EYES DO NOT TELL US WHETHER SOMEBODY'S LYING OR NOT
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50029 THAT'S A LONG TIME AGO
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50030 ANYBODY DO ANY WRITING TODAY
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50031 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50032 WHAT'S THE NEXT BIG IDEA FROM THAT
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50033 YOU REMEMBER THOSE ASTROTURFING REVIEWS THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50034 ONE OF THESE REVIEWS IS FAKE
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50035 THE PERSON NEVER WAS AT THE JAMES HOTEL
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50036 THE OTHER REVIEW IS REAL
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50037 THE PERSON STAYED THERE
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50038 BUT I WANT EVERYBODY TO RAISE THEIR HAND AT SOME POINT
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50039 REMEMBER I STUDY DECEPTION
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50040 WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR US IN OUR LIVES
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50041 THIS ISN'T A DECEPTION DETECTION MACHINE TO TELL IF YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S LYING TO YOU ON TEXT MESSAGING
trainval/nn5k4snG3rA/50042 THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF LANGUAGE
trainval/nncPtxLCPrE/50001 WHY IS THAT
trainval/nncPtxLCPrE/50002 SO THE REAL QUESTION THEN IS HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT YOUR BODY MAKES THE EXACT ONES THAT WE NEED TO PROTECT
trainval/nncPtxLCPrE/50003 SO YOU'VE GOT THIS SITUATION IN 2003 WE HAD AN H5N1
trainval/nncPtxLCPrE/50005 WE'VE GOT THESE NEW ANTIBODIES WE'VE IDENTIFIED AND WE KNOW THAT THEY LATCH ONTO MANY MANY VARIATIONS OF THE
trainval/nncPtxLCPrE/50006 WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TO LATCH ONTO A SPECIFIC PART SO IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT THE PRECISE STRUCTURE OF THAT PART
trainval/nncPtxLCPrE/50007 SO FOR INSTANCE A BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY HAS NOW FOUND BROADLY NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES TO INFLUENZA
trainval/nncPtxLCPrE/50008 SO TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO COMBINE SMART VACCINE DESIGN WITH SMART PRODUCTION METHODS AND OF
trainval/nncPtxLCPrE/50009 SO HERE'S AN ALARMING THOUGHT
trainval/nncPtxLCPrE/50011 WELL WITH THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES EMERGING NOW I HOPE WE CAN SAY DEFINITIVELY YES
trainval/nncYSMA1Iu8/50001 AND I FELT LIKE SAYING TO HIM BUT I DIDN'T SAY I FELT LIKE SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/NNHAgXy5dxQ/50001 FOR A LONG TIME PEOPLE SAID THAT A BASIC INCOME IS IMPOSSIBLE
trainval/NNHAgXy5dxQ/50002 IF YOU HAVE A BASIC INCOME THAT'S EQUAL FOR EVERYBODY THE RELATIVELY POOR THE RELATIVELY
trainval/NNHAgXy5dxQ/50003 SONIA GANDHI TOLD US THAT
trainval/nnYhZCUYOxs/50001 WHAT THAT MEANS IS WE'RE SEEING THE PAINFUL CONSTRUCTION OF A GLOBAL MARKET ECONOMY
trainval/nnYhZCUYOxs/50002 THEIR PARENTS OR THEIR COMMUNITIES USED TO HAVE OCCUPATIONS AND PRIDE AND
trainval/nnYhZCUYOxs/50004 AND WE'VE SEEN THAT THE WORLD'S LABOR SUPPLY HAS QUADRUPLED
trainval/nnYhZCUYOxs/50005 THEY WILL NOT VOTE FOR BREXIT OR FOR TRUMP OR FOR MARINE LE PEN
trainval/nnYhZCUYOxs/50006 WE NEED TO ENABLE PEOPLE TO FEEL IN CONTROL OF THEIR TIME
trainval/nnYhZCUYOxs/50007 THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING
trainval/nO69NjadSec/50001 MANY OF US HAVE LOST FAMILY FRIENDS OR LOVED ONES TO THIS HORRIBLE DISEASE
trainval/nO69NjadSec/50002 TODAY OVER 600 CLINICAL TRIALS ARE OPEN ACTIVELY RECRUITING PATIENTS TO EXPLORE ALL ASPECTS
trainval/nO69NjadSec/50003 SO THEN THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO WE DO WITH THIS INFORMATION
trainval/nO69NjadSec/50004 IN FACT WE LIE AT THE INTERSECTION OF THE THREE OF THE MOST EXCITING DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN CANCER RESEARCH
trainval/nO69NjadSec/50005 SO INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR CANCERS TO BE LARGE ENOUGH TO CAUSE SYMPTOMS OR FOR THEM TO BE DENSE ENOUGH TO SHOW UP ON
trainval/nO69NjadSec/50006 SO LET ME TELL YOU HOW WE DO THIS
trainval/nO69NjadSec/50007 LET ME WALK YOU THROUGH AN EXAMPLE OF ONE PATIENT
trainval/nO69NjadSec/50008 FOR SOME PATIENTS THIS HUNDRED DAYS MEANS THE MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH
trainval/nO69NjadSec/50009 WE WILL WIN THE WAR ON CANCER
trainval/nO69NjadSec/50010 WE THEN APPLY STATISTICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL METHODS TO BE ABLE TO FIND THE SMALL SIGNAL THAT'S PRESENT
trainval/nO69NjadSec/50011 THE KEY THEN IS TO SEE WHETHER WE'RE ABLE TO DETECT THESE RECURRENCES OF CANCERS EARLIER THAN WITH
trainval/no809a9j25w/50001 SO HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE WOKEN UP ON A MONDAY MORNING AND REALIZED YOU HAD TO GO TO WORK AND YOU'RE LIKE OH PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME GO
trainval/no809a9j25w/50002 WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY THIRD TACTIC
trainval/no809a9j25w/50003 SO WHY ARE WE DOING IT
trainval/no809a9j25w/50004 IT'S JUST A GREAT TIME OF EXERCISE AND FUN AND BONDING
trainval/no809a9j25w/50005 I'M A BUSINESS PROFESSOR HERE AT UTAH STATE AND I TEACH THE NEGOTIATIONS CLASS
trainval/nOHbn8Q1fBM/50001 IT DIDN'T WORK PERFECTLY BUT I STILL THINK THEY SORT OF CRACKED THE DOOR AJAR ON A
trainval/nOHbn8Q1fBM/50002 TO ME AS A SCIENTIST THAT'S FANTASTIC BUT AGAIN AT THE SAME TIME IT OPENS THE DOOR
trainval/nOHbn8Q1fBM/50003 WE HAVE TO BAN THIS
trainval/nOHbn8Q1fBM/50004 SO I THINK WE NEED TO PUT A HOLD ON THIS BUT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO NOT ONLY DISAGREE WITH ME
trainval/nPdUMWGWE28/50001 SO I THINK WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IT'S NOT THAT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG IT'S THAT THEY DON'T FEEL A REALLY
trainval/nPdUMWGWE28/50002 I THINK THIS IS THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE
trainval/nPdUMWGWE28/50003 BECAUSE THE PROCESS OF GETTING OLDER IN THE PAST WASN'T ABOUT FORWARD PLANNING
trainval/nPdUMWGWE28/50004 UNTIL AGRICULTURE IT WAS VERY MUCH ABOUT SURVIVING THE MOMENT AND DOING THE RIGHT THING NOW
trainval/nPdUMWGWE28/50005 NO INSTINCT IS THERE FOR NO REASON
trainval/nPdUMWGWE28/50006 THAT'S WHAT WE'VE EVOLVED TO FEEL
trainval/nPdUMWGWE28/50007 SO THEY'RE BRINGING OUT THE BIG GUNS HERE
trainval/nPdUMWGWE28/50008 I MEAN THE POINT AT WHICH WE SWITCHED OVER TO EATING MEAT WE WEREN'T LIKE THE CHIMPANZEE ABLE TO
trainval/nPdUMWGWE28/50009 WE SEE THE BRAIN TRIPLING IN SIZE
trainval/nPdUMWGWE28/50010 WE SEE THE APPEARANCE OF THE MODERN NEOCORTEX WHICH IS THE EXECUTIVE LAYER OF THE HUMAN BRAIN THAT DEFINES HOW WE PERCEIVE
trainval/nPdUMWGWE28/50011 THERE ARE MANY THEORIES ON THAT THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME
trainval/nPdUMWGWE28/50012 WHY WOULD YOU GO AFTER THIS STUFF WHEN IT'S SO MUCH MORE DIFFICULT
trainval/nPdUMWGWE28/50013 WE'VE LOST A TENNIS BALL'S WORTH OF BRAIN IN THE PAST 30000 YEARS
trainval/nPdUMWGWE28/50014 IT'S A GOLF BALL'S WORTH IN THE PAST 20000
trainval/nPdUMWGWE28/50015 IT SEEMS LIKE THE NATURAL DIET THAT THEREFORE BRINGS ABOUT THE CONDITIONS OF GOOD HEALTH IN THE BODY
trainval/nPdUMWGWE28/50016 BUT ASIDE FROM THAT JUST BEING VEGAN IS SO USEFUL IN TERMS OF SOCIETY BECAUSE
trainval/npFSbX7DZ6k/50001 KENNEDY AND HAS OPERATED OVER THE LAST 54 YEARS IN WELL OVER 100
trainval/npFSbX7DZ6k/50002 IT ALSO DOES HEALTH EDUCATION AND SECONDARY HEALTH CARE
trainval/npFSbX7DZ6k/50003 WITH MORE CONTACTS THAT WE'RE ABLE TO MAKE WE CAN FIND OUT WHAT OTHER
trainval/npFSbX7DZ6k/50004 AND DAVID WAS ABLE TO GO ALONG ON THESE TRIPS WITH ME SO WE WERE ABLE TO EXPLORE AND
trainval/npFSbX7DZ6k/50005 I WOULD FREQUENTLY BE BECKONED MR
trainval/npFSbX7DZ6k/50006 JORDANIANS HAVE LARGER FAMILIES THAN WE TEND TO HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY VERY COMMON TO HAVE
trainval/npFSbX7DZ6k/50007 WE WERE ALSO ABLE TO MEET MORE PEOPLE BECAUSE THE WOMEN WHO COME FROM THE UNIVERSITY ARE
trainval/npFSbX7DZ6k/50008 THEY KNOW THAT
trainval/npFSbX7DZ6k/50009 SO WHY ARE WE TELLING YOU ALL OF THIS
trainval/npFSbX7DZ6k/50010 WHAT'S THE VALUE IN IT FOR YOU
trainval/npFSbX7DZ6k/50011 FOR US IT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR LIVES THAT WE TREASURE
trainval/nPGVm6OesQk/50001 THINK ABOUT HUNDRED BIGGEST COMPANIES IN THE WORLD
trainval/nPGVm6OesQk/50003 FOR YEARS WE WERE DISREGARDED PEOPLE WERE NOT INTERESTED IN WHAT POLES THINK
trainval/nPGVm6OesQk/50004 IF YOU GO TO SWITZERLAND AND PEOPLE TELL YOU HOW WAS IN WARSAW
trainval/nPGVm6OesQk/50005 IT'S SUCH A DYNAMIC VIBRANT PLACE
trainval/nPGVm6OesQk/50006 WE WERE ALL THINKING WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT AND OUR COMMISIONARY IN THE EU LEWANDOWSKI SAID
trainval/nPGVm6OesQk/50007 HE SAID IMPOSSIBLE PROTOCOLS BLA BLA BLA CALL FERNANDES AND TELL HIM TO DO IT
trainval/NPSelwWdPa0/50001 WHICH IS CRAZY RIGHT
trainval/nq0SzGzSc8g/50001 AND IT'S BEEN REALLY QUITE AN INTERESTING TIME FOR ME TO MEET UP WITH OTHER SCIENTISTS WHO COME IN AND TALK ABOUT
trainval/nq0SzGzSc8g/50002 WHAT'S THE PROCESS BY WHICH THAT COULD HAPPEN
trainval/nQcgD5DpVlQ/50001 9 IDENTICAL IT'S SO APPEALING THAT THIS IDEA WAS SEIZED UPON BY
trainval/nQcgD5DpVlQ/50002 AM I MAKING THIS UP
trainval/nqj6fH2i9go/50001 BUT FOR EVERY PROBLEM THERE IS AT LEAST ONE SOLUTION
trainval/nqj6fH2i9go/50002 ONE WHICH WAS FROM PANAMA AND ANOTHER ONE WHICH WAS FROM MEXICO
trainval/nqj6fH2i9go/50003 IT WAS LIKE A SIGN FOR US AND THE NEXT DAY WE WENT MORE ENERGETIC AND MOTIVATED THAN EVER BEFORE TO THE
trainval/nqj6fH2i9go/50004 WITH YUNITY WE WILL NOT ONLY PROVIDE THE GROUNDBREAKING TOOLS AND KNOWLEDGE TO MAKE THE FOODSHARING SUCCESS STORY
trainval/NR33yerZgso/50001 I WATCHED HOW SHE WAS AND I LOVED JUST HOW ACCOMPLISHED SHE WAS AND MY PARENTS
trainval/NR33yerZgso/50002 WHEN THE HEART SAYS I DON'T KNOW THEN IT'S TIME TO WAIT
trainval/NRcPXtqdKjE/50001 AND BASED ON THAT GUESS WE RAISE HIM TO BE A HIM OR HER TO BE A HER
trainval/NRcPXtqdKjE/50002 HAD ANOTHER MOMENT
trainval/NRcPXtqdKjE/50003 TODAY I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT GENDER AND NOT SEXUALITY
trainval/NRcPXtqdKjE/50004 TRUCKS AND SOLDIERS AND LEGOS ARE THEIR TOYS BUT THEY BREAK THEM ALL
trainval/NRcPXtqdKjE/50005 BECAUSE BOYS WILL BE BOYS
trainval/NRcPXtqdKjE/50006 GIRLS HATE BUGS LOVE HUGS AND ARE BETTER AT VACUUMING RUGS
trainval/NRcPXtqdKjE/50007 TWO OPTIONS TO DESCRIBE EVERY PERSON IN THIS ROOM EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU
trainval/NRcPXtqdKjE/50008 AND GENDER CHANGES OVER TIME
trainval/NRcPXtqdKjE/50009 YOU CAN'T SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT GENDER
trainval/NRcPXtqdKjE/50010 NOW I KNOW THAT THAT WAS NUMBER ONE
trainval/NRcPXtqdKjE/50011 AND WE HAVE TIME TO DO THAT
trainval/NRcPXtqdKjE/50012 BUT YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO
trainval/NRcPXtqdKjE/50013 DOES ME HAVING A BEARD MAKE MY SALMON PANTS LESS GIRLY
trainval/NRcPXtqdKjE/50014 AWAPUHI GINGER LEAVE IN CONDITIONER FACIAL SCRUB FULL BODY WASH
trainval/NRcPXtqdKjE/50015 LET'S PUT THIS ALL TOGETHER
trainval/NRLjrZD6kqQ/50001 BUT WHY IS IT HAPPENING
trainval/NRLjrZD6kqQ/50002 WE HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS AND QUICK
trainval/NRO0SJXuFMY/50001 THESE ARE CONFIDENTIAL PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE COUNSELING THAT PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT
trainval/NRO0SJXuFMY/50002 WHAT'S THAT MARIJUANA DOING FOR HIM
trainval/NRO0SJXuFMY/50003 IT'S ABOUT SAYING
trainval/NRO0SJXuFMY/50004 NEVER EVER GIVE UP
trainval/NRXCxJGQ4KY/50001 BUT WHAT YOU ARE BUYING NOW IS GREAT
trainval/NRXCxJGQ4KY/50002 NOW MANYA BECAME SO SUCCESSFUL IN SELLING CARS THAT SOON SHE MOVED ON TO SELLING AIRPLANES
trainval/NRXCxJGQ4KY/50003 ALSO WE ARE CHOOSING BY LOOKING AT WHAT OTHERS ARE CHOOSING
trainval/NRXCxJGQ4KY/50004 NOW WE DELIVERED THE CONFERENCE IN SUCH A WAY
trainval/NRXCxJGQ4KY/50005 NOW YOU WILL BE SURPRISED THAT A MAJORITY OF OUR AUDIENCE DID NOT THINK THAT WHAT THEY'D
trainval/NRXCxJGQ4KY/50006 WAS A COMPLETELY RANDOM PAPER
trainval/NRXCxJGQ4KY/50007 THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT SPEAKING FROM THE POSITION OF AUTHORITY LIKE TWO PROFESSORS WE
trainval/NRXCxJGQ4KY/50008 AND FOR ME IT'S VERY SHOCKING TO SEE SOMETIMES VERY POOR PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE NOT SUPPORTING THE IDEA
trainval/NRXCxJGQ4KY/50009 NOW WHEN WE ARE ANXIOUS OVER CHOICES SOMETIMES WE EASILY GIVE OUR POWER OF CHOICE AWAY
trainval/NRXCxJGQ4KY/50010 FIRST I REALIZED A LOT OF CHOICE I MAKE IS NOT RATIONAL
trainval/NRXCxJGQ4KY/50012 WE CAN CHOOSE TO HAVE DIFFERENT RATING AGENCIES
trainval/NRXCxJGQ4KY/50013 NOW IN REGARD TO THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CRISIS WE THINK THAT WE WILL JUST WAKE UP AGAIN
trainval/NS4bBu9Jyho/50001 FOR EXAMPLE IT WAS NOT ONLY STUDENTS BUT ALSO TEACHERS WHO DID NOT FEEL MOTIVATED
trainval/nshZ0SMsn9s/50001 I TURN TO THAT CORNER OF THE ARENA AND I THRUST MY FIST IN THE AIR IN VICTORY
trainval/nshZ0SMsn9s/50002 SIMPLY BY MAKING A MOMENT
trainval/nshZ0SMsn9s/50003 BUT HERE'S HOW YOU CAN DO IT TOO
trainval/Nt88TSEAgDE/50001 AS YOUR MOTHER MAY HAVE SAID
trainval/nTFEUsudhfs/50001 THEY CAN WATCH AT THEIR OWN TIME AND PACE
trainval/nTFEUsudhfs/50002 NO WE HAVE AN AWESOME TEAM WORKING ON IT
trainval/nTFEUsudhfs/50003 I HAVE TO BE CLEAR IT'S NOT JUST ME ANYMORE
trainval/nTFEUsudhfs/50005 ONCE AGAIN I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE USED IN CLASSROOMS
trainval/nTFEUsudhfs/50006 AND THIS IS SOMETHING I RECOMMEND EVERYONE IN THIS AUDIENCE DO
trainval/nTFEUsudhfs/50007 THOSE DASHBOARDS THE TEACHERS HAVE YOU CAN GO LOG IN RIGHT NOW AND YOU CAN ESSENTIALLY BECOME A COACH FOR
trainval/nTFEUsudhfs/50008 BUT YEAH IT'S ALL THERE
trainval/NtOoDN0ojxo/50001 FOR EACH COMPLETED SUICIDE THERE IS THEN ANOTHER 20 SUICIDE ATTEMPTS
trainval/NtOoDN0ojxo/50002 INSTEAD I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT EACH AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US CAN DO TO HELP REDUCE THE RATE
trainval/NtOoDN0ojxo/50003 BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE NEED TO FIRST UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT OF COMMON CONTEXT
trainval/NtOoDN0ojxo/50004 I MEAN APART FROM THE FACT THAT MY ALARM WENT OFF AT 5
trainval/NtOoDN0ojxo/50005 BUT AS SOMEONE WHO WORKS SPECIFICALLY IN MEN'S MENTAL HEALTH I'M GOING TO LEAVE THAT CONVERSATION FOR SOMEONE
trainval/NtOoDN0ojxo/50006 WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PHYSICAL HEALTH WE UNDERSTAND THAT AT ONE END OF THE SPECTRUM WE HAVE SOMETHING AS SMALL AND
trainval/NtOoDN0ojxo/50007 AND THE SAME THING NEEDS TO HAPPEN WITH MENTAL HEALTH
trainval/NtOoDN0ojxo/50008 SO IF SOMEONE IS GOING THROUGH A BIT OF A ROUGH PATCH WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION AND MAKE SURE THAT SUPPORT IS THERE
trainval/NtOoDN0ojxo/50009 FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE SUICIDE IS WHEN THEIR INBUILT COPING MECHANISMS ARE OUTWEIGHED BY THEIR
trainval/NtOoDN0ojxo/50010 THIS IS BACKED UP BY A STUDY THAT CAME OUT OF THE US BY DOCTOR RICHARD SEIDEN WHICH STUDIED 515 PEOPLE
trainval/NtOoDN0ojxo/50011 BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THESE STUDIES WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEM CLOSER IS THAT THESE STUDIES OFTEN ABOUT
trainval/NtOoDN0ojxo/50012 IT WAS AN APP FOR SMART DEVICES AND WE ENCOURAGED PEOPLE ACROSS AUSTRALIA TO TAKE PART AND LOG
trainval/NtOoDN0ojxo/50013 WE ASKED THEM TO TELL US WHAT EMOTION THEY WERE FEELING AT ANY GIVEN POINT IN TIME AT WHAT INTENSITY THAT EMOTION
trainval/NtOoDN0ojxo/50014 AND AGAIN YOU'D BE FORGIVEN FOR THINKING THAT THE RESULTS BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN WOULD BE VASTLY DIFFERENT
trainval/NtOoDN0ojxo/50015 THAT'S WHAT WE EXPECTED AS WELL
trainval/NtOoDN0ojxo/50016 I SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT TOO THAT IN TERMS OF MEN POTENTIALLY BEING MORE EMOTIONALLY STUNTED THERE
trainval/NtOoDN0ojxo/50017 BUT I THINK THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING ELSE REALLY MAJOR AT PLAY
trainval/NtOoDN0ojxo/50018 OH I'M OFF TO BROGA YOU CAN SAY
trainval/NtOoDN0ojxo/50019 WELL ACTUALLY NO I DON'T NEED TO LAUGH AND MOCK THEM BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FIT INTO THIS LITTLE BOX
trainval/NtOoDN0ojxo/50020 BECAUSE WE KNOW FROM THE DATA THAT IF PEOPLE ARE IN ENVIRONMENTS WHERE OTHER PEOPLE ARE SHARING HOW THEY'RE FEELING THE OTHER
trainval/NtOoDN0ojxo/50021 BUT BY LAYING A FOUNDATION OF OPENNESS AND HONESTY YOU'RE ALLOWING THE OTHER PERSON TO
trainval/NtOoDN0ojxo/50022 AND AS I SAID AT THE START THERE ARE FIVE GUYS OUT THERE TODAY WHO ARE ALIVE AT THIS VERY SECOND THEIR HEARTS ARE
trainval/nU5gOr1cSxU/50001 THEY HAD EITHER DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL OR WERE UNEMPLOYED
trainval/nU5gOr1cSxU/50002 BUT DID THESE JOBS REALLY FULFILL THEM AS INDIVIDUALS
trainval/nU5gOr1cSxU/50003 WHAT ARE THEIR INDIVIDUAL PASSIONS
trainval/nU5gOr1cSxU/50004 WELL QUITE SIMPLY THEY LOST INTEREST
trainval/nU5gOr1cSxU/50005 THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE ENGAGE THEM IN SOMETHING THEY'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT
trainval/nU5gOr1cSxU/50006 BUT HOW COULD SHE BECOME ONE
trainval/nU5gOr1cSxU/50007 THEY HAD NOTHING TO WAKE UP TO IN THE MORNING
trainval/nU5gOr1cSxU/50008 CRIME BECOMES A WAY OF SURVIVAL
trainval/nU5gOr1cSxU/50009 VIOLENCE BECOMES A WAY TO EXPRESS THEIR FRUSTRATION
trainval/nU5gOr1cSxU/50010 AND THEIR SELF ESTEEM AND SELF CONFIDENCE WENT UP ONCE THEY REALIZED WHAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF
trainval/nU5gOr1cSxU/50011 I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HER NAME OR HER AGE BUT I COULDN'T GET HER OFF MY MIND
trainval/nU5gOr1cSxU/50012 CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING TRAPPED AND IMPRISONED IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO GROW
trainval/nU5gOr1cSxU/50013 OR BEING COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF YOUR OWN POTENTIAL
trainval/nU5gOr1cSxU/50014 AND I REALIZED AT THAT MOMENT I HAD TO FIND SOMEONE WHO COULD OFFER HER SOME GUIDANCE
trainval/nU5gOr1cSxU/50015 I DECIDED TO SET UP A NETWORK OF PARTNERS IN THE COMMUNITY
trainval/nU5gOr1cSxU/50016 AND THERE'RE SO MANY OTHER WAYS TO GET INVOLVED
trainval/nU5gOr1cSxU/50017 OUR ONLINE PLATFORM WHICH WE'RE PLANNING TO LAUNCH SOON WILL ALLOW ANYONE OF YOU TO CONTRIBUTE TO EMPOWERING YOUTH IN
trainval/nU5gOr1cSxU/50018 WHERE WAS SHE
trainval/nU5gOr1cSxU/50019 FOR THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS SHE'S BEEN TAKING PRIVATE LESSONS WITH A VOLUNTEER FASHION DESIGN INSTRUCTOR AND
trainval/nubSKdtzLcE/50001 WHO'S IN THE RIGHT
trainval/nubSKdtzLcE/50002 WHO'S A BADDIE
trainval/nubSKdtzLcE/50003 I USED TO WORK AT SHAKESPEARE'S GLOBE THEATRE
trainval/nubSKdtzLcE/50004 COME WITH ME
trainval/nubSKdtzLcE/50006 PERSON A HAS TO MAKE A SUGGESTION AND THAT SUGGESTION CANNOT BE CONSTRAINED BY REALITY
trainval/nubSKdtzLcE/50007 AND NUMBER TWO IS THAT THAT CREATIVE URGE THAT URGE JUST TO DROP ALL THE CULTURAL
trainval/nubSKdtzLcE/50008 ONE OF THE SCHOOLS THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THAT IS A MONASTERY SCHOOL
trainval/nubSKdtzLcE/50009 IT MIGHT BE THAT THEY ARE FROM A VERY RURAL AREA WHERE THERE IS NO STATE SCHOOL
trainval/nubSKdtzLcE/50010 OFTEN THE CHILDREN IF THERE'S NO SCHOOL THEY GET SENT AWAY TO A MONASTERY SCHOOL
trainval/nubSKdtzLcE/50011 SO SOME OF THEM ARE RESIDENTIAL
trainval/nubSKdtzLcE/50012 A LOT OF THE PARENTS OF THESE CHILDREN LIVE IN SLUMS WHICH IS UNOFFICIAL
trainval/nubSKdtzLcE/50013 IT WAS JUST A PERFECT TINY MOMENT OF ABSOLUTE EQUALITY
trainval/nUdsTizSxSI/50001 AND I WOULD TRY TO REASON WITH THEM AND SAY WHY DON'T WE TRY SOMETHING ELSE
trainval/nUdsTizSxSI/50002 IT'S IN EVERY LANGUAGE I'VE HAD EXPERIENCE WITH SO FAR
trainval/nUdsTizSxSI/50003 SO THAT'S WHAT I DID
trainval/nUdsTizSxSI/50004 OR HOW PAINFUL WAS THIS
trainval/nUdsTizSxSI/50005 I WOULD PASS THEIR SHEET OF PAPER
trainval/nUdsTizSxSI/50006 NOW YOU MUST HAVE ALL TAKEN A BAND AID OFF AT SOME POINT AND YOU MUST HAVE WONDERED WHAT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH
trainval/nUdsTizSxSI/50007 AND YOU WEIGH THESE OPTIONS OUT YOU DO THE SIMPLE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS AND YOU DECIDE WHETHER IT'S WORTHWHILE TO COMMIT THE CRIME OR
trainval/nUdsTizSxSI/50008 YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT AS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY ON THE TABLE INCREASES PEOPLE WOULD CHEAT MORE BUT IN FACT IT WASN'T THE CASE
trainval/nUdsTizSxSI/50009 WE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE CHEATING BY STEALING BY A LITTLE BIT
trainval/nUdsTizSxSI/50010 SO WE SAID IF PEOPLE ARE NOT SENSITIVE TO THE ECONOMIC RATIONAL THEORY EXPLANATIONS TO THESE FORCES
trainval/nUdsTizSxSI/50011 AND WE THOUGHT MAYBE WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT THERE ARE TWO FORCES
trainval/nUdsTizSxSI/50012 AT ONE HAND WE ALL WANT TO LOOK AT OURSELVES IN THE MIRROR AND FEEL GOOD ABOUT OURSELVES SO WE DON'T WANT TO CHEAT
trainval/nUdsTizSxSI/50014 IN FACT EVERY DAY WHEN WE OPEN THE NEWS WE SEE EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE CHEATING
trainval/nUdsTizSxSI/50015 WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE GROUP
trainval/nUdsTizSxSI/50016 GO HOME AND THEY WENT WITH THE MONEY
trainval/nUdsTizSxSI/50017 BUT IF IT'S SOMEBODY FROM ANOTHER GROUP THESE TERRIBLE PEOPLE I MEAN NOT TERRIBLE IN THIS BUT SOMEBODY WE DON'T WANT TO ASSOCIATE
trainval/nUdsTizSxSI/50018 THEY CHEAT JUST BY A LITTLE BIT
trainval/nUdsTizSxSI/50019 AND WHEN WE SEE CHEATING AROUND US PARTICULARLY IF IT'S A PART OF OUR IN GROUP CHEATING GOES UP
trainval/nUdsTizSxSI/50020 NOW IF WE THINK ABOUT THIS IN TERMS OF THE STOCK MARKET THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS
trainval/nUdsTizSxSI/50021 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DO OTHER THINGS LIKE YOU REMOVE THINGS FROM MONEY
trainval/nUdsTizSxSI/50022 COULD IT BE THAT WITH THOSE MORE DISTANT THINGS IT'S NOT A TOKEN FOR ONE SECOND IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS MANY STEPS REMOVED
trainval/nUdsTizSxSI/50023 I FELT MY INTUITION WAS CORRECT
trainval/nUdsTizSxSI/50024 IF THESE NURSES WOULD HAVE BEEN WILLING TO CHECK THEIR INTUITION AND HOW EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF WE JUST START DOING MORE SYSTEMATIC
trainval/NuJg8auo7FE/50002 SAM JUST KEEPS STARING
trainval/nv0dObM5XGk/50002 ALL HER STUDENTS WERE MARINES
trainval/nv0dObM5XGk/50003 THEY MAKE SKILLS MANIFEST
trainval/nVEvzeIXbpk/50001 YES THOSE ARE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS
trainval/nVEvzeIXbpk/50002 AND THAT IS WHAT WE NEED TO CHANGE
trainval/nVEvzeIXbpk/50003 AND ALSO BECAUSE OUR LEGAL FRAMEWORK ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT FANTASTIC IT'S ALSO NOT TERRIBLE
trainval/nVEvzeIXbpk/50004 PROBABLY THIS GENERATION HAS SOMETHING TO CONTRIBUTE
trainval/nVEvzeIXbpk/50005 BUT JUST IN CASE DON'T FORGET THREE ENVELOPES
trainval/nVEvzeIXbpk/50006 DON'T BE SHY
trainval/nVEvzeIXbpk/50008 DON'T TAKE ME WRONG
trainval/nVEvzeIXbpk/50009 IN WHICH WE SUPPORT NONPROFITS AND CAUSES THAT WE LIKE AND THAT WE TALK ABOUT IT AND WE DO IT
trainval/nVEvzeIXbpk/50010 WE DO STUFF AND WE TALK ABOUT IT
trainval/NVPxmzSPvUw/50001 WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU HAD NO IDEA WHAT YOU WERE DOING
trainval/NVPxmzSPvUw/50002 SO I CONFIDENTLY STATE
trainval/NVPxmzSPvUw/50003 IT'S THAT THING YOU'VE BEEN DYING TO MASTER
trainval/NVPxmzSPvUw/50004 BUT A CLIENT OF MINE RECENTLY EXPLAINED WHAT I DO FAR BETTER THAN I EVER COULD
trainval/NVPxmzSPvUw/50005 BUT SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE MORE INTO NPR THAN SCIENCE {LG}
trainval/NVPxmzSPvUw/50006 WHAT WAS EVEN SCARIER AT LEAST TO ME WAS THAT THE LEAST COMPETENT PEOPLE WERE THE
trainval/NVPxmzSPvUw/50007 SO FOR ME IN MY WORK COACHING LEADERS I'M OFTEN SENT IN TO TELL SOMEONE THE TRUTH
trainval/NVPxmzSPvUw/50008 THEY SAID HE WAS AS SMART AS THEY COME
trainval/NVPxmzSPvUw/50009 NO NO LET'S BE HONEST
trainval/NVPxmzSPvUw/50010 ON AND ON IT WENT ONE THING AT A TIME FOR MONTHS
trainval/NVPxmzSPvUw/50011 IN A VERY SHORT TIME HE FELT A NEW LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE
trainval/NVPxmzSPvUw/50012 IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD THEY STARTED TALKING ABOUT THIS WONDERFUL GUY WHO THEY CALLED THE
trainval/NVPxmzSPvUw/50013 HERE'S MY ADVICE
trainval/NVPxmzSPvUw/50014 SO THE BEST MARATHON RUNNERS DON'T ACTUALLY SHOW PHYSICAL DIFFERENCES WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS HOW MUCH THEY
trainval/NVPxmzSPvUw/50015 SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
trainval/nvSSeGObF4w/50001 WHAT'S A PANIC ATTACK
trainval/nvSSeGObF4w/50002 YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/nvSSeGObF4w/50003 I LIVED A VERY COLOURFUL LIFE
trainval/nvSSeGObF4w/50004 THAT'S HOW I DEAL WITH ALL THE NEGATIVE IN MY LIFE
trainval/nvSSeGObF4w/50005 I'M NOW 49 YEARS OLD
trainval/nvSSeGObF4w/50006 I USED TO SAY I OWN A GENERAL CONSTRUCTION COMPANY
trainval/nvSSeGObF4w/50007 I'M 25 YEARS OUT THERE AS A GENERAL CONTRACTOR
trainval/Nvw0reB1gpI/50001 SO DECIDE FOR YOURSELF
trainval/Nvw0reB1gpI/50002 DO YOU WANT A LOT OF SHINY OBJECTS
trainval/nw6u3fk88pY/50001 WHAT IS YOUR SELF WORTH
trainval/nw6u3fk88pY/50003 SO NOW IF YOUR BAROMETER IS TELLING YOU THAT THINGS JUST AREN'T QUITE RIGHT THAT SOMETHING IS NOT QUITE
trainval/NwmGTM5Py8Y/50001 I GREW UP IN A HOME WHERE NEWS WAS IMPORTANT
trainval/NwmGTM5Py8Y/50002 INFORMATION REPORTED AFTER A RIGOROUS SERIES OF CHECKS AND BALANCES TO ENSURE ACCURACY AND
trainval/NwmGTM5Py8Y/50003 IS IT SOMETHING OUR AUDIENCE WANTS
trainval/NwmGTM5Py8Y/50004 THEY GO OUT AND THEY FIND FACTS AND THEY ASSEMBLE THOSE FACTS AND THEY PROVIDE CONTEXT FOR THE
trainval/NwmGTM5Py8Y/50005 WE FIGHT VERY HARD TO AVOID IT BUT WE CANNOT SOMEHOW AVOID THE PERCEPTION OF
trainval/NwmGTM5Py8Y/50006 THAT IS HOW IT WORKS
trainval/NWUFjb8w9Ps/50001 AND ASK YOURSELF WHAT PROBLEM HAVE YOU SOLVED EVER THAT WAS WORTH SOLVING WHERE YOU KNEW ALL OF THE GIVEN
trainval/NWUFjb8w9Ps/50002 I'M SURE WE ALL AGREE THAT NO PROBLEM WORTH SOLVING IS LIKE THAT
trainval/NWUFjb8w9Ps/50003 AND WE REALIZE HOW GREAT WOULD IT BE IF WE JUST HAD SOME A B C AND D LABELS TO TALK ABOUT THEM MORE EASILY
trainval/NWUFjb8w9Ps/50004 HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE YOU TO FILL IT UP
trainval/NWUFjb8w9Ps/50005 WE HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT
trainval/NWUFjb8w9Ps/50006 MATH MAKES SENSE OF THE WORLD
trainval/NWUFjb8w9Ps/50007 MATH IS THE VOCABULARY FOR YOUR OWN INTUITION
trainval/NWUFjb8w9Ps/50008 EVERYONE'S FILLED SOMETHING UP WITH WATER BEFORE SO I GET KIDS ANSWERING THE QUESTION HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50001 I EVEN KNEW AT SEVEN YEARS OLD THAT I COULD GET A FRACTIONAL PERCENT OF A CENT AND PEOPLE WOULD PAY IT BECAUSE IT
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50002 AT SEVEN YEARS OLD I FIGURED IT OUT
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50003 I SAID BUT YOU'VE GOT TWO CARS
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50004 REMEMBER I'M NINE YEARS OLD
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50005 I'M LIKE YOU HAVE TWO CARS AND THEY DON'T HAVE LICENSE PLATE PROTECTORS
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50007 IT WAS A SPEAKING EVENT IN FRONT OF GROUPS OF ENTREPRENEURS FROM AROUND THE WORLD
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50008 NO ONE SAID GET HIM A COACH IN SPEAKING
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50009 EVERY PROBLEM OUT THERE SOMEBODY HAS THE IDEA FOR
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50010 THEY TEACH THEM TO WORK IN CORPORATIONS
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50011 SO WHO'S STARTING THESE COMPANIES
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50013 ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER BIPOLAR DISORDER
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50014 DO YOU KNOW THAT BIPOLAR DISORDER IS NICKNAMED THE CEO DISEASE
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50015 TED TURNER'S GOT IT
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50016 STEVE JOBS HAS IT
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50017 SORRY ENTREPRENEURS AREN'T STUDENTS
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50019 WE FIGURE OUT THE GAME
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50020 I STOLE ESSAYS
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50021 I CHEATED ON EXAMS
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50022 I OPEN UP CHAPTER EIGHT TALKING ABOUT BUDGETING
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50023 WE WENT DOWN TO THE BASEMENT AND I OPENED UP THIS CUPBOARD
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50024 DON'T TRY TO SELL TO THE POOR KIDS THEY DON'T HAVE CASH
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50025 I'M NOT GOING TO SEE YOU WASTE A PENNY
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50027 AND THEN YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50028 EVERY YEAR ALL THE MONEY IN THE BANK GOES TO THEIR BROKER
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50029 IT'S LIKE A RECESSION
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50030 SO THERE'S A RECESSION
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50031 GO GET SOME OF THAT
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50032 SO I KNEW THERE WERE TWO CARS WITH TWO LICENSE PLATES ON EACH
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50033 IF I COULDN'T SELL ALL FOUR I COULD AT LEAST GET ONE
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50034 AND I COLLECTED IT FROM THE AUTOMOTIVE SHOPS IN THE AREA ON MY BICYCLE
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50035 THEN MY DAD WOULD DRIVE ME ON SATURDAYS TO A SCRAP METAL RECYCLER WHERE I GOT PAID
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50036 THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50037 SO I JUST PACKAGED THEM
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50038 I'M LIKE 12 RIGHT
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50039 I PACKAGED THEM UP THREE WAYS
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50040 I HAD THE PINNACLES DDHS AND THE REALLY COOL ONES
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50041 THOSE SOLD FOR TWO DOLLARS EACH
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50042 AND THEN I'D SELL 50 AT A TIME OF ALL THE CRAPPY ONES
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50043 YOU'VE GOT THIS DEMAND OVER HERE THAT HAS MONEY
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50044 THAT WAS COOL BECAUSE THEN I HAD RETAIL OUTLETS
trainval/nx3GuO41Jyg/50045 WE WOULDN'T HAVE THAT STUFF RIGHT
trainval/Nx8RRIiP53Q/50001 THERE ARE NO MODELS FOR THEM
trainval/Nx8RRIiP53Q/50002 2011 THE HUNDRED MOST POPULAR MOVIES
trainval/Nx8RRIiP53Q/50003 BUT THERE IS A NUMBER THAT IS GREATER THAN THIS THAT'S GOING TO BRING THIS ROOM
trainval/Nx8RRIiP53Q/50004 THEY ARE THROWING IT UP IN THE AIR
trainval/NXfYNdapq3Q/50001 I DON'T THINK ANYONE DOES
trainval/NXfYNdapq3Q/50003 THEY'RE WILLING TO OPEN UP A NEW SPACE FOR CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT AND
trainval/nXOSQeZNjJo/50001 AUTHOR JULIA CAMERON WHO WROTE THE ARTIST'S WAY
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50001 MY MOTHER HAD THIS VIEW GROWING UP WHICH IS AWESOME BUT WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY IT'S NOT THAT COOL
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50002 MY FATHER LEFT I SUSPECT BECAUSE OF THIS MAN
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50003 JUST LETTUCE TOMATO CUCUMBER WHATEVER
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50004 EVERY SATURDAY HE WAS OUT THERE CUTTING THE GRASS MAKING SURE THE GUTTERS WERE CLEAN PAINTING UPKEEPING MAKING
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50005 BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE VACUUMING
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50006 BECAUSE IT'S THERE BUT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND THE MOMENT I WALKED UP HERE AND WE BECOME ADULTS IT GOES
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50007 SO HOW DO WE STAY BRAVE
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50008 I'LL TELL A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY STORY
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50009 AND KNOW WHEN TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50010 TO ANYONE OF YOU I COULD WALK UP AND SAY I DON'T LIKE YOUR SWEATER
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50011 NOW THE PROBLEM IS MY BROTHERS WENT TO THE SAME SCHOOL SO I HAD TO CONVINCE THEM TO DO THE EXACT SAME THING
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50012 MY DAD STOPPED ASKING
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50014 I HAD SOME ONE MINUSES I PUT A PLUS
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50015 AND I SAID BUT I DIDN'T LIE THIS TIME
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50016 THINGS WERE JUST NOT GOING WELL FOR ME AT ALL
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50017 AND IT WAS ONE OF THESE ILLNESSES WHERE YOU KNOW GO TO THE DOCTOR THEY TRY TREATMENT THEY TRY THIS TRY THAT NOTHING WORKS
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50018 SO AFTER ABOUT A YEAR OF THAT THEY SAID OK WE'LL HAVE TO PUT YOU UP ON THE RACK AND STUFF HAS TO COME OUT AND IT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50019 I STILL WASN'T HAPPY
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50020 I WAS ALIVE
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50021 I WAS DOING WELL I WAS HEALTHY
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50023 MY MAIDEN NAME IN FRENCH IS GUERRIER FOR WARRIOR
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50024 AND I DECIDED I WAS GOING TO PUT IT SOMEWHERE WHERE I CAN SEE IT EVERYDAY
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50025 AND MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY GET THEIR FIRST TATTOO THEY HIDE IT SOMEWHERE BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT I WANTED TO MAKE THIS MINE
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50026 SO THAT EVERY MORNING WHEN I GOT UP I PUT A BRACELET ON OVER THAT TATTOO
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50027 IT'S ALSO ON MY RIGHT HAND BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50028 MY POWER LIES WITHIN MY RIGHT HAND
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50029 I DON'T HAVE TO ACCEPT ALL THE BAD THINGS THAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO ME
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50030 I CAN WRITE SOMETHING DOWN
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50031 AND THAT'S THE SAME THING THAT I WORK ON EVERYDAY TO TEACH OUR CHILDREN TO MOVE IT FORWARD
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50032 I DON'T ADVOCATE FOR MY CHILDREN
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50033 I PUSH THEM TO ADVOCATE FOR THEMSELVES
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50034 AND I PUSH HIM FORWARD AND HE HAS TO GO ARGUE THAT GRADE WITH HIS TEACHER
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50035 THE SAME THING WITH MY 7 YEAR OLD I'M ONLY SEVEN
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50037 SURROUND YOURSELF WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE BETTER THAN YOU THAT ARE STRONGER THAN YOU
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50038 AND THAT WILL HELP PROPEL YOU FORWARD
trainval/nxRRqLpWi6Q/50039 BECAUSE YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK IT'S BECAUSE I'M BLACK
trainval/nyLYQYHGbvI/50001 IT WOULD REALLY BOOST THE ECONOMY
trainval/nyLYQYHGbvI/50002 I WAS COMING AT IT FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE WHERE I WAS BRINGING THAT DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE TO BEAR ON THE PROBLEM
trainval/NyQ1wLFj0f8/50001 HE LEFT AND THE MONKS STARTED TO PONDER THE RABBI'S WORDS
trainval/NyQ1wLFj0f8/50003 I ALSO LEARNED TO SPEAK IN PUBLIC
trainval/NyQ1wLFj0f8/50004 I LEARNED TO ORGANIZE EVENTS
trainval/NyQ1wLFj0f8/50005 I LEARNED TO BE A COACH AND A MENTOR TO ENTREPRENEURS
trainval/nz0cAjXVepg/50001 AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT YOU HAVE A STEADY STREAM OF VISITORS AND VOLUNTEERS COMING IN SHOWERING YOU IN THE
trainval/nzj7Wg4DAbs/50001 THERE IS BASICALLY JUST ONE WAY IN WHICH A BEEHIVE CAN FUNCTION
trainval/nzj7Wg4DAbs/50002 WHAT KIND OF CHIMPANZEE ARE YOU
trainval/nzj7Wg4DAbs/50003 WHAT EXACTLY ARE THESE THINGS
trainval/nzj7Wg4DAbs/50004 YOU COULD NEVER DO IT WITH CHIMPANZEES
trainval/nzj7Wg4DAbs/50005 BUT OVER THE CENTURIES WE HAVE CONSTRUCTED ON TOP OF THIS OBJECTIVE
trainval/nzj7Wg4DAbs/50006 AND MUCH OF THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL HISTORY OF THE LAST 200 YEARS INVOLVED WHAT TO DO WITH
trainval/nzj7Wg4DAbs/50007 IN MOST TASKS AND WILL MAKE HUMANS REDUNDANT
trainval/nZLO2PnGzMg/50001 WHAT SHE WAS KIND OF SAYING IS
trainval/nZLO2PnGzMg/50002 THEY ARE MAYBE MAKING EIGHT NINE TEN DOLLARS AN HOUR
trainval/nZLO2PnGzMg/50003 WE WASTE A LOT OF TIME
trainval/nZLO2PnGzMg/50004 I'M GOING TO TRAVEL THE WORLD
trainval/nZLO2PnGzMg/50005 I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO BE
trainval/nZLO2PnGzMg/50006 I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO
trainval/NZspSEdO2Xk/50001 WE CAN'T LIVE WITH IT WE CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT
trainval/NZspSEdO2Xk/50002 BUT THE MATERIALITY MATTERS TOO BECAUSE IN EVERY SOCIETY THAT
trainval/NZspSEdO2Xk/50003 IS THIS REALLY HOW PEOPLE ARE
trainval/NZspSEdO2Xk/50004 IS THIS REALLY HOW ECONOMIES BEHAVE
trainval/NZspSEdO2Xk/50005 AND ALMOST STRAIGHTAWAY WE ACTUALLY RUN UP AGAINST A COUPLE OF ANOMALIES
trainval/NZspSEdO2Xk/50006 SO WE CAN KEEP THIS GROWTH BASED ECONOMY GOING
trainval/NZspSEdO2Xk/50007 GOODNESS KNOWS WHAT THEY MAKE OF THE LAKE DISTRICT WEATHER
trainval/NZspSEdO2Xk/50008 BUT ACTUALLY THAT CHILDISH MISREPRESENTATION STUCK WITH ME
trainval/NZspSEdO2Xk/50009 SO WHO ARE WE
trainval/NZspSEdO2Xk/50010 WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE CREATED ECONOMIES
trainval/NZspSEdO2Xk/50011 AND MY THEN FIVE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WAS HELPING ME IN THE WAY THAT FIVE YEAR OLDS DO
trainval/NZspSEdO2Xk/50012 YOU'RE NOT MAKING NEWS OUT OF THINGS FALLING DOWN
trainval/NZspSEdO2Xk/50013 IT HAS TO BE CIVIL SOCIETY
trainval/o08ykAqLOxk/50001 IN THE NEXT DECADE
trainval/o08ykAqLOxk/50002 THIS YEAR GLOBAL POVERTY IS GOING TO FALL TO 12 PERCENT
trainval/o08ykAqLOxk/50003 WELL THE SOCIAL PROGRESS INDEX CAN HELP US CALCULATE THIS BECAUSE AS YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED THERE ARE NO ECONOMIC
trainval/o08ykAqLOxk/50004 AND NOW WE CAN USE THIS INFORMATION TO START BUILDING OUR FORECAST
trainval/o08ykAqLOxk/50005 HOW RICH ARE WE GOING TO BE IN 2030
trainval/o08ykAqLOxk/50006 1 PERCENT AVERAGE GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH OVER THE NEXT 15 YEARS WHICH MEANS THAT IN
trainval/o08ykAqLOxk/50008 BECAUSE THE SOCIAL PROGRESS INDEX ALSO HAS SOME VERY GOOD NEWS
trainval/o08ykAqLOxk/50009 OUR CHOICES MATTER IF WE PRIORITIZE THE WELL BEING OF PEOPLE THEN WE CAN MAKE A LOT MORE
trainval/o08ykAqLOxk/50010 AND WE NEED TO HOLD THEM TO THAT PROMISE BY HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE TRACKING THEIR PROGRESS ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE NEXT 15
trainval/o08ykAqLOxk/50011 LET'S DEMAND A DIFFERENT PATH
trainval/o08ykAqLOxk/50012 AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE RICH COUNTRIES SCORING STRAIGHT A'S
trainval/o0q3veMwv6A/50001 THEY WONDERED IF THEY SHOULD BE WORRIED
trainval/o0q3veMwv6A/50002 IT TURNED OUT LA HAD JUST SUFFERED A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE WHICH RESULTED IN CITYWIDE BLACKOUTS
trainval/o0q3veMwv6A/50003 IN FACT WHAT THEY WERE SEEING WAS NOT A TRAIL FROM SOME ALIEN SPACESHIP BUT
trainval/o0q3veMwv6A/50004 BUT WE SHOULD ALSO THINK ABOUT WHAT IS THIS DOING TO OUR HEALTH IF WE'RE FLOODING OURSELVES WITH THIS
trainval/o0q3veMwv6A/50005 YOU SHOULD BE FOR 30 TO 60 MINUTES OUTSIDE IN BRIGHT LIGHT SO PUT SOME SUNSCREEN ON AND GO
trainval/o0q3veMwv6A/50006 THE FLIP SIDE OF THIS IS THAT WHEN YOU COME HOME AT NIGHT I WOULD DARE GUESS THAT PRETTY
trainval/o0q3veMwv6A/50007 AND WE'RE NOT IN TUNE WITH THE NATURAL LIGHT AND DARK CYCLES RIGHT
trainval/o0q3veMwv6A/50008 TWO PEOPLE IN MY LAB
trainval/o0q3veMwv6A/50009 BUT WHAT WE'RE EXPOSING OURSELVES TO EVERY DAY NOW IS VERY MUCH INTERFERING WITH
trainval/o0q3veMwv6A/50010 AND IN PARTICULAR WHAT'S REALLY BAD IS THAT THESE DEVICES ARE VERY VERY RICH IN BLUE LIGHT
trainval/o0TbaHimigw/50001 WHAT IS A TEACHER TO DO EVEN A GREAT TEACHER LIKE WENDY
trainval/o0TbaHimigw/50002 SO LET ME SHARE WITH YOU AN EXAMPLE THAT MIGHT HELP
trainval/o0TbaHimigw/50003 I WON'T FORGET THAT SCENE BECAUSE THERE WASN'T MUCH LEARNING GOING ON BUT I ALSO WON'T FORGET HIS EYES
trainval/o0TbaHimigw/50004 THEY BOTH GOT THE RIGHT ANSWER
trainval/o0TbaHimigw/50005 IT'S JUST THE FIRST STEP TO A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF SUBJECT MATTER
trainval/o0TbaHimigw/50006 BECAUSE THAT DRIP DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A TICKING CLOCK
trainval/o0TbaHimigw/50007 BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/o0TbaHimigw/50008 THESE ARE OUR FUTURE INNOVATORS OUR FUTURE DOERS
trainval/o0TbaHimigw/50009 IT'LL NEVER REPLACE GREAT TEACHERS
trainval/o0td5aw1KXA/50001 I WOULD BANG AND BUMP INTO THINGS ON THE LEFT SIDE OF MY BODY
trainval/o0td5aw1KXA/50002 IF I PUT THIS LEFT HAND ON THE HOT BURNER I WOULD FEEL PAIN BUT I HAD NO IDEA WHERE IT WAS
trainval/o0td5aw1KXA/50003 I COULD NOT JUDGE HOW FAR AWAY WAS THAT CAR
trainval/o0td5aw1KXA/50004 GEOMETRY WAS A NIGHTMARE
trainval/o0td5aw1KXA/50005 SO I SOLDIERED ON
trainval/o0td5aw1KXA/50006 I WENT ON TO STUDY PSYCHOLOGY TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME WHAT WAS THE
trainval/o0td5aw1KXA/50007 SO I PULLED ANOTHER BOOK OFF THE SHELF OPENED IT READ IT AND UNDERSTOOD IT
trainval/o0td5aw1KXA/50008 AND BY THE TIME I WAS FINISHED I WAS SURROUNDED BY A PILE OF A HUNDRED BOOKS AND I HAD BEEN ABLE TO READ
trainval/o0VrZPBskpg/50001 I IDENTIFIED AND CODIFIED THIS FACTOR AND I'M HERE TO SHARE MY FINDINGS WITH YOU
trainval/o0VrZPBskpg/50002 SO I CARED ABOUT FRITZ AND I'M NOT UNIQUE
trainval/o0VrZPBskpg/50003 MOST OF US CARE ABOUT ANIMALS
trainval/o0VrZPBskpg/50004 AND SHE REPLIES THE SECRET IS IN THE MEAT
trainval/o0VrZPBskpg/50005 CHANCES ARE YOUR EXPERIENCE OF THE MEAT DRAMATICALLY CHANGED
trainval/o0VrZPBskpg/50006 FOR MUCH OF MY LIFE I NEVER WONDERED ABOUT MY CHOICE TO EAT CERTAIN ANIMALS BECAUSE I NEVER EVEN KNEW I HAD A CHOICE
trainval/o0VrZPBskpg/50007 NO ONE HAD EVER ASKED ME IF I BELIEVED IN EATING ANIMALS
trainval/o0VrZPBskpg/50008 EATING ANIMALS WAS JUST A GIVEN
trainval/o0VrZPBskpg/50009 AND THEN SOMETHING INTERESTING HAPPENED
trainval/o0VrZPBskpg/50010 IN A MOMENT I'M GOING TO SHOW A TWO MINUTE VIDEO OF ANIMAL FACTORIES WHICH CAN BE DIFFICULT
trainval/o0VrZPBskpg/50011 SO I WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT MY INTENTION IS SIMPLY TO RAISE AWARENESS
trainval/o0VrZPBskpg/50012 I KNOW IT CAN BE PAINFUL TO SEE THAT
trainval/o0VrZPBskpg/50013 HINTS OF THE TRUTH SURROUND US
trainval/o0VrZPBskpg/50014 AND ALTHOUGH THE EXPERIENCE OF EACH SET OF VICTIMS WILL ALWAYS BE SOMEWHAT UNIQUE THE
trainval/o1abyP4zfGg/50001 THAT'S A GREAT LAW OF NATURE
trainval/o1abyP4zfGg/50002 TO ONE PART IN 10 10 ACTUALLY
trainval/o1abyP4zfGg/50003 IT'S NOT THAT I'LL DO SOMETHING HERE AND THEN THIS RESPONSE
trainval/o1abyP4zfGg/50004 I WANT TO EXPLAIN TO YOU ACTUALLY WHAT THIS THEORY IS
trainval/o1abyP4zfGg/50005 SO THEY FALL IN THE SAME WAY INDEPENDENT OF THEIR MASS
trainval/o1abyP4zfGg/50006 WHAT IS THE HIDDEN STRUCTURE UNDERLYING THE GEOMETRY OF SPACE TIME WHICH WAS SMOOTH
trainval/o1abyP4zfGg/50007 WHAT IS THE HIDDEN STRUCTURE
trainval/o1abyP4zfGg/50008 IS THERE SOMETHING BELOW IT THAT WE ARE NOT SEEING NOT EXPERIENCING BUT WHICH ACTUALLY HOLDS THE WHOLE THING
trainval/o1abyP4zfGg/50010 I WILL TELL YOU WHAT A BLACK HOLE IS
trainval/o1abyP4zfGg/50011 THAT IS A BLACK HOLE
trainval/o1abyP4zfGg/50012 MUCH BEFORE WE ACTUALLY KNEW REALLY OF THE EXISTENCE OF ATOMS
trainval/O1j2A6ndEio/50001 BRITTANY DID THAT
trainval/o2BJsFkzSYU/50001 MOTHERHOOD WAS NOT JUST A DREAM
trainval/o2BJsFkzSYU/50002 FOR ME IT WAS A GUARANTEE
trainval/o2BJsFkzSYU/50003 YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT BABY ANYWAY
trainval/o2BJsFkzSYU/50004 MANY OF THESE WOMEN WERE JUST LIKE ME
trainval/o2BJsFkzSYU/50005 THEY DREAMED OF BECOMING A MOTHER SINCE THEY WERE OLD ENOUGH TO EMULATE THEIR OWN MOTHERS AND GRANDMOTHERS
trainval/o2BJsFkzSYU/50006 A FEW DAYS AFTER MADISON DIED I BLOGGED ABOUT MY TO DO LIST FOR THE UPCOMING DAY
trainval/o2BJsFkzSYU/50007 I AM A VOICE
trainval/o3VwYIazybI/50002 PROGRAM AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY
trainval/O4bGOvkkHcM/50001 BUT WHAT DOES THAT DO
trainval/O4bGOvkkHcM/50002 SO I'M GOING TO MAKE US HYPER AWARE
trainval/O4bGOvkkHcM/50003 BUT WHAT MAKES SOMETHING UNMEMORABLE
trainval/o4Nno6POrwE/50001 NOW THROUGHOUT HISTORY PEOPLE HAVE COMMITTED HORRIBLE CRIMES AND ATROCITIES IN THE NAME OF
trainval/o4Nno6POrwE/50002 THE PROBLEM IS THAT AFTER A FEW CENTURIES THE DATE REMAINS ON THE CALENDAR BUT THE LOVE
trainval/o4Nno6POrwE/50003 NOW WE HAD NO MONEY NO SPACE NO GAME PLAN BUT WE DID HAVE EMAIL
trainval/o4Nno6POrwE/50004 THEY WERE CYNICS AND SEEKERS ATHEISTS AND RABBIS
trainval/o4Nno6POrwE/50005 AND SO I SET OUT TO DO THE ONLY RATIONAL THING THAT SOMEONE WOULD DO IN SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE I QUIT MY JOB
trainval/o4Nno6POrwE/50006 I REMEMBER THE NIGHT THAT I READ ABOUT THE SERIES OF COORDINATED BOMBINGS IN THE SUBWAY SYSTEM IN
trainval/o4Nno6POrwE/50007 EVERYTHING FELT SO PRECARIOUS
trainval/o4Nno6POrwE/50008 AND I REMEMBER THINKING MY GOD WHAT KIND OF WORLD DID WE BRING THIS CHILD INTO
trainval/o4Nno6POrwE/50009 WE ARE GOING BACK INTO OUR SACRED TRADITIONS AND RECOGNIZING THAT ALL OF OUR TRADITIONS CONTAIN THE
trainval/o4Nno6POrwE/50010 IT'S CALLED PSYCHIC NUMBING
trainval/o4Nno6POrwE/50011 HOPE MAY BE THE SINGLE GREATEST ACT OF DEFIANCE AGAINST A POLITICS OF
trainval/o4Nno6POrwE/50012 I CAN'T CONTROL EVERYTHING AND I CANNOT DO THIS ON MY OWN
trainval/o4Nno6POrwE/50013 THE OTHER SLIP OF PAPER SAYS FOR MY SAKE THE WORLD WAS CREATED
trainval/o4Nno6POrwE/50014 I CAN PROTEST
trainval/o4Nno6POrwE/50015 IT'S A SIGN OF TOTAL SUBMISSION
trainval/o4Nno6POrwE/50016 I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO CARE WHEN BLACK YOUTH ARE HARASSED BY POLICE BECAUSE MY WHITE LOOKING
trainval/o4Nno6POrwE/50017 AND GUESS WHAT
trainval/o4Nno6POrwE/50018 TRANSPHOBIA AND ISLAMOPHOBIA AND RACISM OF ALL FORMS THOSE ARE ALSO ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS
trainval/o4Nno6POrwE/50019 AND SO TOO IS ANTI SEMITISM ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS
trainval/o4Nno6POrwE/50020 BECAUSE EMMA LAZARUS WAS RIGHT
trainval/o4Nno6POrwE/50021 WITHIN 12 HOURS 20 MILLION PEOPLE SAW THAT IMAGE OF AYLAN KURDI'S LITTLE BODY WASHED UP
trainval/o5ojwGhKr20/50001 I WAS IMAGINING THAT I CAN SIT IN A CLASS AT HARVARD YARD I CAN CLIMB ON TOP OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING I CAN
trainval/o5ojwGhKr20/50002 WHILE I WAS ENJOYING MY CLASSES AT HARVARD YARD I WAS ALSO AMAZED BY THE HOT DEBATE ABOUT HOW CHINA WILL
trainval/o5ojwGhKr20/50003 WHILE I WAS CLIMBING THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING I WAS ALSO AMAZED THAT THE SKYSCRAPERS NEARBY ARE
trainval/o5ojwGhKr20/50004 WHEN CHINA WAS TRYING TO INNOVATE ITS MADE IN CHINA' PRODUCTS THERE WAS CONCERN IN AMERICA WHETHER THERE IS A RISING
trainval/o5ojwGhKr20/50005 THE MOST RECENT CHINA LED AIIB BANK WHICH IN US IS ABSENT AND THE US LED TPP WHICH IN
trainval/o5ojwGhKr20/50006 WITH THE JOINT EFFORTS THIS PROJECT MAY HELP TO SOLVE THE PRESSING CLEAN WATER ISSUES IN CHINA WHILE
trainval/o5ojwGhKr20/50007 IT IS A JOURNEY OF HOW CHINA WOULD ADVANCE THROUGH INTEGRATION THROUGH THE WORLD COMMUNITY
trainval/o5ojwGhKr20/50008 IT IS A JOURNEY OF HOW US AND CHINA WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLORE SHARED OPPORTUNITIES AND
trainval/o5SrKh9BNHg/50001 AND HE STARTED TO FOLLOW HIS SPECIAL ABOUT THE PHOTOGRAPHY
trainval/O6cmKeRV3Z0/50001 YOU KNOW IT'S VERY INTERESTING BEING UP HERE
trainval/O6cmKeRV3Z0/50002 WHEN I WAS A CHILD 1
trainval/O6cmKeRV3Z0/50003 I WAS NEVER IGNORED
trainval/O6cmKeRV3Z0/50004 I WAS ALWAYS AFFIRMED
trainval/O6cmKeRV3Z0/50005 NOT THE WAY THAT I WAS RAISED
trainval/O6cmKeRV3Z0/50006 THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN A HUNTER MIGHT SAY
trainval/O6cmKeRV3Z0/50008 THEY'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT THE PAST THEY'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE
trainval/O6cmKeRV3Z0/50009 IN THIS FIELD OF AWARENESS
trainval/O6cmKeRV3Z0/50010 AND I'M SAYING IN MY CHILD MIND
trainval/O6cmKeRV3Z0/50011 I'M GOING TO BE LIKE THE BIRDS
trainval/O6cmKeRV3Z0/50012 I COULD FEEL THE SEA LION COMING BEFORE IT CAME
trainval/O6cmKeRV3Z0/50013 IT'S A PRETTY AMAZING WAY
trainval/O6cmKeRV3Z0/50014 I CAN TELL YOU GENERALLY IF IT'S MALE OR FEMALE I CAN TELL YOU WHAT SIZE IT IS
trainval/O6cmKeRV3Z0/50015 I CAN TELL HOW IT'S GOING TO FIGHT ON THE WAY UP OR NOT
trainval/O6jrLgvCUNs/50001 A LITTLE PAPER ME
trainval/O6jrLgvCUNs/50003 AND IN A POP UP POPULATION PEOPLE S PROBLEMS POP UP TOO
trainval/O6jrLgvCUNs/50004 THERE D BE A POMPOUS PAPER PARLIAMENT WHO REMAINED OUT OF TOUCH AND WHO IGNORED THE PEOPLE'S PROTESTS ABOUT ALL THE PAPER CUTS THEN
trainval/O6jrLgvCUNs/50006 HE THOUGHT OF HER EVERY SECOND EVERY MINUTE EVERY HOUR
trainval/O6jrLgvCUNs/50007 AND THOUGH AT THE TIME HE FELT STUPID AND DUMB FOR TRYING TO LOVE A GIRL CONTROLLED BY HER STUPID MUM HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMFORTED BY THE SIMPLE SUM
trainval/O6jrLgvCUNs/50008 I MEAN THIS GIRL WAS WICKED SO HE PLUCKED UP THE COURAGE AND ASKED FOR HER DIGITS
trainval/O6jrLgvCUNs/50009 IN THE END HE WAS ONLY READY ONE MINUTE EARLY BUT IT DIDN T MATTER BECAUSE SHE ARRIVED ONE MINUTE LATE
trainval/O6jrLgvCUNs/50010 AND WHAT IT ALSO MEANS IS YOU CAN WIN
trainval/O6jrLgvCUNs/50011 THEY D BE PURPLE PAPER PEOPLE
trainval/O6jrLgvCUNs/50012 MAYBE POP UP PURPLE PAPER PEOPLE
trainval/O6jrLgvCUNs/50013 BUT I WOULDN T WANNA DEAL WITH ALL THE PAPER PEOPLE POLITICS
trainval/O6jrLgvCUNs/50014 PEOPLE WHO GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO MAKE YOUR LIFE BETTER AND EXPECT NOTHING IN RETURN
trainval/O6jrLgvCUNs/50015 I LIKE PEOPLE
trainval/O6jrLgvCUNs/50016 THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE
trainval/O6jrLgvCUNs/50017 THEY SAID HIS HEAD WAS UP IN SPACE AND THEY WOULD BRING HIM DOWN TO EARTH ESSENTIALLY HE CAME FROM NOTHING AND THAT IS WHAT HE WAS
trainval/O6jrLgvCUNs/50018 YES THE SUNSHINE KID WAS BRIGHT WITH A WARM PERSONALITY AND INSIDE HE BURNED
trainval/O6jrLgvCUNs/50019 WHO EVERY SINGLE DAY SINCE I WAS BORN HAVE TAKEN TIME OUT OF THEIR MORNING TO PRAY FOR ME
trainval/O6jrLgvCUNs/50020 PEOPLE WHO ARE CAPABLE OF GENUINE FORGIVENESS
trainval/O817Q8G5WL4/50001 IN 2005 I GRADUATED FROM ST
trainval/O817Q8G5WL4/50002 WE ARE VERY VERY FORTUNATE HERE IN THE ROCHESTER AREA TO HAVE THREE OUTSTANDING BUSINESS
trainval/O817Q8G5WL4/50003 I ASKED MYSELF WHY
trainval/O8e8TtfzSpY/50001 MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE ELEPHANTS SHARE MANY THINGS IN COMMON WITH US
trainval/O8e8TtfzSpY/50002 THEY BURY THEIR DEAD
trainval/O8e8TtfzSpY/50003 THEY EDUCATE THE NEXT OF KIN
trainval/O8e8TtfzSpY/50004 THEY HAVE SOCIAL KNITS THAT ARE VERY CLOSE
trainval/O8e8TtfzSpY/50005 LIKE 99 PERCENT OF ALL THE ANIMALS THAT HAVE ONCE LIVED THEY GO EXTINCT LIKELY DUE TO A WARMING CLIMATE AND
trainval/o8NPllzkFhE/50001 I MADE IT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AND IT WASN'T EVEN OPEN SOURCE AT THAT POINT
trainval/o8NPllzkFhE/50002 THIS COULD ACTUALLY IMPROVE THIS
trainval/o8NPllzkFhE/50003 THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO MAKE SMALL SMALL CHANGES
trainval/o8NPllzkFhE/50004 I MEAN YOU'VE CHANGED THE FUTURE
trainval/o8NPllzkFhE/50005 YOU'RE A VISIONARY RIGHT
trainval/o8xWaNpSlbI/50001 YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO ALL THIS STUFF
trainval/o8xWaNpSlbI/50002 YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO AMEND THE SOIL YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO WATER THEM SO THAT SUITED ME FINE
trainval/o8xWaNpSlbI/50003 LIKE I NOTICE GARY YOU HAVE SOME NICE AMARANTH IN THAT WEED SLIDE
trainval/o8xWaNpSlbI/50004 THERE ARE 6000 EDIBLE WILD PLANTS
trainval/O90nfczjNHA/50001 NOW I'M NOT SAYING THAT DEALING WITH THE MEDIA ISN'T THE CAPABILITY A POLITICIAN SHOULD HAVE NOWADAYS
trainval/O90nfczjNHA/50002 KIND REGARDS BEA
trainval/O90nfczjNHA/50003 IT SIMPLY CANNOT BE CAMPAIGN DAY EVERY DAY
trainval/O90nfczjNHA/50004 AND THAT'S THE BASIS ON WHICH YOU DECIDE WHOM TO VOTE FOR BUT AFTER HAVING FINISHED YOUR BIRTHDAY CAKE
trainval/o9DNWK6WfQw/50001 THE LIGHTS WERE TOO BRIGHT
trainval/o9DNWK6WfQw/50002 I KEPT HAVING PANIC ATTACKS BUT THEY EVENTUALLY WENT AWAY
trainval/o9DNWK6WfQw/50003 BUT I DIDN'T REALLY THINK IT AFFECTED ME
trainval/o9DNWK6WfQw/50004 THESE PEOPLE ARE IN DANGER
trainval/o9DNWK6WfQw/50005 EVERYONE'S BEEN IN IT OR IS GOING TO BE IN IT
trainval/o9DNWK6WfQw/50006 IT'S AS IF THEY'RE ALL IN ONE BIG TRIBE
trainval/o9DNWK6WfQw/50007 THE SUICIDE RATE WENT DOWN
trainval/o9DNWK6WfQw/50008 WE WERE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE THREAT AGAINST US
trainval/o9DNWK6WfQw/50009 IT'S JUST GETTING WORSE
trainval/o9DNWK6WfQw/50010 RACE RELATIONS ARE TERRIBLE
trainval/O9Hfqc3trhw/50001 IT IS HARD WORKING WITH FAMILIES WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN SPLIT BY THE IMMIGRATION RULES WHERE THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO LIVE
trainval/O9Hfqc3trhw/50002 THE ESTIMATE FOR THIS YEAR IS THAT IT IS GOING TO BE HIGHER
trainval/O9Hfqc3trhw/50005 WE DO NOT READ A LOT ABOUT IT IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA FOR A WHILE IT WAS IN NEWSPAPERS A LOT NOT SO
trainval/O9Hfqc3trhw/50006 BUT NOT FOR THE PEOPLE AFFECTED OBVIOUSLY
trainval/O9Hfqc3trhw/50008 AND OF COURSE THAT CAUSES PEOPLE TO FLEE
trainval/O9Hfqc3trhw/50009 OF COURSE PEOPLE WANT TO REACH SAFETY AND SECURITY AND SOME OF THEM ARE WILLING TO PUT THEIR LIVES AT RISK
trainval/O9Hfqc3trhw/50011 I SAY A LOT
trainval/O9Hfqc3trhw/50013 WELL WE HAVE CANCELED THE SEA RESCUE MISSIONS TO HELP THESE PEOPLE
trainval/O9Hfqc3trhw/50015 GERMANY IS OFFERING 30000 PLACES ON A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND SIMPLE RESETTLEMENT SCHEME
trainval/O9Hfqc3trhw/50016 UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE POLITICIANS DID FINALLY AGREE TO A RESETTLEMENT SCHEME AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THEN
trainval/O9Hfqc3trhw/50017 IT HAS BEEN JUST OVER A YEAR NOW
trainval/O9Hfqc3trhw/50018 1 MILLION IN LEBANON
trainval/O9Hfqc3trhw/50019 143 HERE IN THE UK
trainval/O9Hfqc3trhw/50020 IT IS SHAMING FRANKLY
trainval/O9Hfqc3trhw/50021 THEN LAST MONTH TO TOP IT ALL WE HAVE STOPPED SYRIANS WHO HAVE GOT US VISAS WHO ARE TRAVELING TO THE US
trainval/O9Hfqc3trhw/50023 THEY'RE STUCK IN A KAFKAESQUE BUREAUCRACY
trainval/O9Hfqc3trhw/50024 THERE IS ALSO NO PROSPECTS OF HER BEING REMOVED AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL
trainval/O9Hfqc3trhw/50025 WAS IT BECAUSE IT WAS ON PRINCIPLE
trainval/O9Hfqc3trhw/50026 SOMETHING LIKE THAT
trainval/O9Hfqc3trhw/50028 ONCE SHE WAS THERE SHE WAS TO SPEND TWO YEARS IN DETENTION AND SHE HAS ONLY JUST BEEN RELEASED
trainval/O9Hfqc3trhw/50029 THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD IS 12 MONTHS
trainval/O9Hfqc3trhw/50030 SO WE ARE TRYING TO SAY WELL IF HE WOULD NOT BE DEPORTED NOW THEN SURELY HE SHOULD BE READMITTED
trainval/O9Hfqc3trhw/50031 HE HAS BEEN AWAY FROM HIS FAMILY NOW FOR SEVERAL YEARS THEY HAVE HAD SOME REALLY HARD TIMES THIS FAMILY THEY HAVE HAD
trainval/o9NUy12lgs4/50001 I WAS AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE WHERE I HAD TO MAKE A DECISION
trainval/o9NUy12lgs4/50002 THANK GOD THEY DID THAT BECAUSE PIECE BY PIECE I STARTED GETTING A LITTLE BIT OF MYSELF BACK
trainval/o9NUy12lgs4/50003 SHE SPEAKS ABOUT GRIT
trainval/o9NUy12lgs4/50004 DEFINED BY YOUR STAMINA SO YOUR ABILITY TO RUN THE MARATHON NOT THE
trainval/o9NUy12lgs4/50006 YOU'RE ALSO PAYING FOR THEM TO BE CREATIVE
trainval/o9NUy12lgs4/50007 THEY INSPIRED ME SO MUCH THAT I DECIDED TO PUT MY MONEY WHERE MY MOUTH IS
trainval/o9NUy12lgs4/50008 IT'S NOT A PERMANENT CONDITION
trainval/Oa82WNk0mis/50001 IT WAS LIKE VISITING A MORE INNOCENT TIME ON THE PLANET
trainval/Oa82WNk0mis/50002 THE PROJECT IS PART ART AND PART SCIENCE
trainval/OaGEMSRms48/50001 BUT IN INDIA ONLY 12 PERCENT OF GIRLS AND WOMEN HAVE ACCESS TO HYGIENIC WAYS OF MANAGING
trainval/OaGEMSRms48/50003 DURING MY YEARS OF WORK IN THIS FIELD I HAVE EVEN COME ACROSS STORIES WHERE GIRLS HAVE TO EAT AND WASH THEIR DISHES
trainval/OaGEMSRms48/50004 THAT'S WHAT WE WANTED
trainval/OaGEMSRms48/50005 WHILE MAKING THE BOOK WE TOOK GREAT CARE THAT NONE OF THE ILLUSTRATIONS WERE OBJECTIONABLE IN ANY WAY
trainval/OaGk5BSO0Pg/50001 YOU CAN SEE THIS AFFECT IN CHILDREN THAT ARE JUST TWO AND 1 2 YEARS OLD
trainval/OaGk5BSO0Pg/50002 BY SOME OF OUR FELLOW SPECIES INCLUDING PRAIRIE DOGS
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50001 AND REMEMBER THIS WAS THE VERY FIRST YEAR OF THE BERT PROGRAM
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50002 IT WAS QUITE BINARY AT THAT TIME
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50003 IT'S MY FIRST SINCE BRIDGE AND TUNNEL WHICH I DID ON BROADWAY AND THIS ONE I THANK
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50004 CLASS LET'S BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN ALL ELECTRONIC DEVICES ARE SWITCHED OFF
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50005 REMEMBER THESE EARLY MODULES IN THESE PEOPLE'S FULL IDENTITIES WERE
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50006 THERE YOU ARE IN MY EAR
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50007 RIGHT RIGHT SO PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO FEEL MY EXPERIENCE AND MY MEMORY
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50008 NO RIGHT I'M READY
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50009 I JUST THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO GIVE ME A TEST TO SEE HOW MY MEMORY'S DOING
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50010 THIS WAS ALSO KNOWN AS A MOBILE PHONE
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50011 OH BECAUSE IT INCLUDES PORNOGRAPHY ALSO
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50012 WELL IT'S NOT LIKE WHAT YOU HAVE WITH THE INTERNET
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50013 YEAH BUT LIKE I DON'T THINK OF MYSELF LIKE PROVIDING DIRECT SEX CARE SERVICES PER
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50014 THAT'S HOW THEY MARKET ME
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50015 IT'S PERFECT THAT'S GRAND
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50016 JUST A DROP MORE
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50017 WHAT WAS YOUR NAME
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50018 IS THAT RIGHT SO PETER
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50019 SHE SAID MAUREEN FITZROY IS THE LIVING EMBODIMENT OF THE WHORE VIRGIN DICHOTOMY
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50020 WELL I'VE GOT THIS TERRIBLE DICHOTOMY
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50021 WELL FOR ME THOUGH IT WAS AS A GIRL IT STARTED WITH ME DAD
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50022 AND I CERTAINLY DIDN'T DO MYSELF ANY FAVORS
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50023 I JUST I DON'T CARE WHAT THESE YOUNG GIRLS SAY
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50024 SO ANOTHER FACT MOST PEOPLE DID NOT KNOW WAS THE AVERAGE AGE OF AN AT RISK GIRL BEING
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50025 BUT GIRLS ESPECIALLY WERE EXPECTED TO BE SEXY WHILE AVOIDING BEING PERCEIVED
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50027 MOST WOMEN IN THE EARLY 2000S CONSIDERED THEMSELVES EMPOWERED AND MEN GENERALLY FELT THEY WERE ALSO
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50028 I'M TRYING TO TALK TO BERT RIGHT NOW
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50029 BUT WHAT WAS THE QUESTION AGAIN
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50030 OF COURSE I BELIEVE IN WOMEN'S RIGHTS
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50031 YEAH SHE KNOWS I'M HERE
trainval/OAK1UIbSFio/50032 AND ACTUALLY LIKE BROS BEFORE HOS IT DOESN'T MEAN LIKE WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE
trainval/oAl82gFMZis/50001 YOU REMOVE ALL THE HARDWOOD AND SELL IT
trainval/oAl82gFMZis/50002 THERE ARE 10000 SPECIES OF MICROBES IN THIS LITTLE GRAM OF SOIL
trainval/oAl82gFMZis/50003 WE DON'T KNOW THAT ON A DAILY BASIS BUT YOU HAVE MORE MICROBIAL CELLS THAN HUMAN
trainval/oAl82gFMZis/50004 ALL DEAD CARCASSES OF ANIMALS ARE RECYCLED BY MICROBES
trainval/ocqn3wYTCRM/50001 AND WE NOW KNOW FROM BACTERIA TO PLANTS TO ANIMALS TO HUMANS WE ALL
trainval/ocqn3wYTCRM/50002 AND THE STRATEGY THERE WAS TO FOLLOW THE LIGHT
trainval/oD06XPtmLZY/50001 WHAT DOES IT MEAN
trainval/oD06XPtmLZY/50002 IT WASN'T ORGANIZED IN THE WAY WE OFTEN THINK OF IT
trainval/oD06XPtmLZY/50003 AND SHE SAID YOU KNOW THE POVERTY WASN'T SO BAD
trainval/oD06XPtmLZY/50004 SOME OF THEM MIGHT BE ONES YOU GAVE
trainval/oD06XPtmLZY/50005 YOU THINK I WILL MISS THE VIOLENCE OR THE DRUGS
trainval/oD06XPtmLZY/50006 YOU ARE NOT DEAD
trainval/oD06XPtmLZY/50007 BUT MAYBE ME I GIVE OUT SOMETHING BETTER BECAUSE I GIVE THEM HOPE
trainval/oD06XPtmLZY/50008 BECAUSE WHEN SYSTEMS ARE BROKEN LIKE THE ONES THAT WE'RE SEEING AROUND THE WORLD IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INVENTION
trainval/oD06XPtmLZY/50009 IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRULY BUILD A WORLD WHERE WE CAN EXTEND SERVICES AND PRODUCTS TO
trainval/oD06XPtmLZY/50010 WE OWE IT TO THE JANES OF THE WORLD
trainval/oD06XPtmLZY/50011 AND JUST AS IMPORTANT WE OWE IT TO OURSELVES
trainval/oDdcx5luv5s/50001 LIKE MANY PEOPLE I WAS HORRIFIED AND MOVED BY THE PHOTOS FROM
trainval/oDdcx5luv5s/50002 HOW ARE WE GOING TO STOP THE EPIDEMIC OF CANCER AND OTHER CHRONIC DISEASES THAT WE ALL
trainval/oDdcx5luv5s/50003 BUT I HAD TWO PROBLEMS IN STARTING THIS ORGANIZATION
trainval/oDdcx5luv5s/50004 I WAS FRIGHTENED OF HOSPITALS
trainval/oDdcx5luv5s/50005 AND THE OTHER PROBLEM WAS I HARDLY KNEW ANYBODY WHO WORKED IN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR
trainval/oDdcx5luv5s/50006 AND HE'S DOING REMARKABLY WELL
trainval/oDdcx5luv5s/50007 THEY HAVE ENORMOUS PURCHASING POWER
trainval/oDdcx5luv5s/50008 MY FIRST JOB OUT OF COLLEGE WAS WRITING GUIDEBOOKS TO FABULOUS PLACES IN EUROPE
trainval/oDdcx5luv5s/50009 HERE ARE SOME FACTS
trainval/oDdcx5luv5s/50010 THEY'RE JUST AS ADDICTED TO FOSSIL FUELS AS THE REST OF THE ECONOMY
trainval/odIvobLv7C4/50001 EVEN THOUGH WE ARE REALLY REALLY EARLY IN THE PROCESS OF THAT PROJECT IT'S SO FASCINATING AND I HAVE
trainval/odIvobLv7C4/50002 IT HAS TO BE THE EXCEPTIONS
trainval/odIXWv1m2a8/50001 IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME TO MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ALLOW ME TO GO
trainval/odIXWv1m2a8/50002 I MADE IT MY MANTRA
trainval/odIXWv1m2a8/50003 MY LAST BIG PROJECT I WAS THE BEST IN THE WORLD
trainval/odIXWv1m2a8/50004 LAST YEAR I WAS APPROACHED BY THE PLASTIC OCEANS FOUNDATION WHO ASKED ME NOT JUST TO BE A PATRON BUT ALSO TO
trainval/odIXWv1m2a8/50005 WHERE DOES IT GO
trainval/odIXWv1m2a8/50006 AND I PREPARED WELL
trainval/oDtZi2SUm8Q/50001 AND ABOUT 42000 PEOPLE DIED FROM SECOND HAND SMOKE
trainval/oDtZi2SUm8Q/50002 THEY HAVE ALL SAID THAT THEY DO NOT WANT ALTRIA'S MONEY AND THAT ALTRIA'S IDENTITY DOES NOT ALIGN WITH
trainval/oDtZi2SUm8Q/50003 OTHERS HAVE SAID THAT THIS IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE BETWEEN THE COMPANIES THAT YOU
trainval/oDtZi2SUm8Q/50004 BUT I'VE COME HERE TODAY BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE STAND FOR
trainval/oDtZi2SUm8Q/50005 AND THAT IS OUR HONOR CODE
trainval/odyakQwtWwo/50002 AND THEN HE STARTED READING ENCYCLOPEDIAS FROM COVER TO COVER
trainval/Oe1cDSPfbh8/50001 I FIRST WANT TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE OF FOOD WASTE BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO
trainval/Oe1cDSPfbh8/50002 WE CAN CREATE A NEW MARKET THAT ALLOWS FOOD THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN WASTED AT THE FARM TO BE TRANSFERRED FROM
trainval/Oe1cDSPfbh8/50003 THE SCALE OF THE MARKET MEANS THAT THOSE THAT CRACK THIS ISSUE ARE GOING TO CREATE TREMENDOUS VALUE
trainval/Oe1cDSPfbh8/50004 BUT TO PUT THAT INTO PERSPECTIVE WE ESTIMATE THAT 80 BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IS THE COST THAT THE
trainval/oEIYHTlbeLA/50001 I AM MY TEACHER'S FIRST MALE STUDENT IN A TRADITION UNDERSTOOD BY MANY AS FEMALE AND I
trainval/oeL72c6scAs/50001 THIS IS BUT ONE OF MANY ASPECTS OF HOW OUR INDUSTRIALIZED AGRICULTURE TODAY
trainval/oeL72c6scAs/50002 INSTEAD ONLY EAT MEAT AND CHEESE FROM COWS THAT WERE FED ON
trainval/oeL72c6scAs/50003 AND IN FACT AMMONIA CAUSES ACID RAIN
trainval/oeL72c6scAs/50004 AND WHEN BROUGHT OUT TO THE FIELD THAT MANURE SEEPS INTO OUR GROUNDWATER AND RIVERS AND CAUSES
trainval/oeL72c6scAs/50005 I WENT TO WORK ON AN ORGANIC FARM CLOSE TO BERN AND THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT
trainval/oeL72c6scAs/50006 AND THAT'S GREAT BECAUSE MANURE IS A FANTASTIC ORGANIC FERTILIZER
trainval/oeL72c6scAs/50007 EARTHWORMS THAT ARE THE BACKBONE OF A HEALTHY FERTILE SOIL COME RUSHING TO THE SURFACE
trainval/oeL72c6scAs/50008 NOW SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO DRINK THAT
trainval/oeL72c6scAs/50009 SO I THOUGHT
trainval/oeL72c6scAs/50010 I ENDED UP GETTING AN INVITATION TO GIVE A PITCH AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE SWISS
trainval/oeL72c6scAs/50011 NOW LET ME QUICKLY EXPLAIN TO YOU HOW THAT HAPPENS AND HOW THAT IS GOING TO HELP SAVE OUR
trainval/oeL72c6scAs/50012 WHEN WE EUROPEANS WERE STILL TAKING A DUMP IN OUR BACKYARDS AND DYING OF THE PLAGUE
trainval/oeL72c6scAs/50013 NOW COMPOSTING IS JUST A LITTLE BIT LIKE BAKING
trainval/oeL72c6scAs/50014 A WHOLE ARMY OF MICROORGANISMS STARTS TO TAKE APART ALL THAT ORGANIC
trainval/oeL72c6scAs/50015 IN THIS FORM ALL OF THE NUTRIENTS ARE LOCKED UP SAFELY NONE OF THEM
trainval/oeL72c6scAs/50016 COWS GOATS AND SHEEP MAY UNLOCK THIS ABUNDANT RESOURCE TO US AND
trainval/oeL72c6scAs/50017 AND MAYBE ONE DAY WE WILL BE ABLE TO BUILD UP SOIL FERTILITY TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT WE MAY
trainval/oeL72c6scAs/50018 SO I HAVE A VISION FOR A WORLD WHERE COWS ONLY EAT
trainval/oeL72c6scAs/50019 I IMAGINE A WORLD WERE EVERY FARMER COMPOSTS HIS MANURE WITH
trainval/OEydHbngSz0/50001 SO I DECIDED I'D BETTER GET TO KNOW SOME PEOPLE WORKING WITHIN THE FIELD
trainval/OEydHbngSz0/50002 I WANTED TO CREATE AN ONLINE AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT PLATFORM THAT WOULD UNCOVER TRENDS IN POLLUTION
trainval/OEydHbngSz0/50003 OUR WILLPOWER AND IMAGINATION ARE A GUIDING LIGHT ENABLING US TO CHART NEW PATHS AND
trainval/OEydHbngSz0/50004 ARMED WITH A FIRMER UNDERSTANDING OF THE AIR POLLUTION PROBLEM AND HAVING MANAGED TO SOURCE OVER A
trainval/OEydHbngSz0/50005 WHY NOT JUST GO AHEAD AND TACKLE THE PROBLEM AS BEST AS YOU CAN IN YOUR OWN WAY
trainval/OEydHbngSz0/50006 YOU MAY BE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED
trainval/OF5VVrsnpzo/50001 AND MOST IMPORTANTLY TRUE LOVE WILL FIND YOU WHEN YOU'RE LEAST EXPECTING IT
trainval/OF5VVrsnpzo/50002 I WAS IN NOT THE BEST RELATIONSHIP ALTHOUGH IT STARTED REALLY WELL AND I THOUGHT THAT THE PERSON I
trainval/OF5VVrsnpzo/50003 NOW THE PROBLEM WAS THAT I HAD A VERY FULL SCHEDULE AND THE LAST THING I WANTED TO DO WAS TO SIT
trainval/OF5VVrsnpzo/50004 SO HE ORDERED ALL KINDS OF DISHES THE MOST EXPENSIVE BOTTLE OF WINE ON THE MENU AND WHEN THE BILL CAME HE
trainval/OF5VVrsnpzo/50005 NOW I AM A MODERN WOMAN AND I AM TOTALLY OK WITH PAYING THE BILL SOMETIMES AND SPLITTING THE BILL SOMETIMES
trainval/OF5VVrsnpzo/50006 BUT I DIDN'T ORDER ALL OF THAT AND THE BILL CAME UP TO WHAT AT THE TIME WAS AN ENTIRE MONTH'S RENT FOR ME
trainval/OF5VVrsnpzo/50007 OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANT HE TRIED TO SHAKE MY HAND AND I SAID THIS IS INTERESTING THANK YOU
trainval/OF5VVrsnpzo/50008 AND I SAID NO I DON'T
trainval/OF5VVrsnpzo/50009 SO DO YOU MIND IF I DO
trainval/OF5VVrsnpzo/50010 AND I THOUGHT AT THIS POINT AM I GOING TO BE ABLE TO STOP HIM
trainval/OF5VVrsnpzo/50011 SO I'M GOING TO DO THREE THINGS
trainval/OF5VVrsnpzo/50012 I'M GOING TO CREATE MY OWN MARY POPPINS LIST TO FIND A HUSBAND
trainval/OF5VVrsnpzo/50013 AND SO IN MY DRUNKEN STATE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I DID
trainval/OF5VVrsnpzo/50014 SO I LOOKED AT THEIR VOCABULARY AND LANGUAGE I LOOKED AT THE LENGTH OF THE PROFILES THEY HAD THEIR SENSES OF HUMOR HOW THEY
trainval/OF5VVrsnpzo/50015 MY FAMILY ALWAYS SAID I COULDN'T POSSIBLY EMAIL OR TALK TO A GUY FIRST THAT I WOULD SEEM TOO AGGRESSIVE
trainval/OF5VVrsnpzo/50016 I WAS ALSO LOOKING AT QUANTITATIVE DATA
trainval/OF5VVrsnpzo/50017 IT'S ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS THAT I FOUND OUT
trainval/OF5VVrsnpzo/50018 IN THE MEANTIME I KEPT SCORING HIM
trainval/OF5VVrsnpzo/50019 THIS ENTIRE TIME THAT I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO EVERYBODY'S ADVICE
trainval/OF5VVrsnpzo/50020 I HAVEN'T BEEN PICKY ENOUGH
trainval/OF5VVrsnpzo/50021 I WAS TOO AFRAID TO GO OUT THERE AND ASK FOR AND DEMAND WHAT I REALLY WANTED
trainval/OF5VVrsnpzo/50022 WELL A YEAR AFTER THAT FIRST DATE WE WERE TRAVELING IN PETRA JORDAN
trainval/OF5VVrsnpzo/50023 AND WHAT THAT ALLOWED ME TO DO WAS TO GO BACK IN AND FROM THIS ENORMOUS POOL OF MEN APPLY MY
trainval/OFbF16DVTXY/50001 THIS HAS BEEN MY DREAM
trainval/OFbF16DVTXY/50002 IT IS FARELY RARE AFFECTING ONLY 1 IN EVERY 50 THOUSAND PEOPLE WORLDWIDE
trainval/OFbF16DVTXY/50003 IN THAT 2 WEEK PERIOD HIGH LEVELS OF PHENYLALANINE COULD ALREADY BE DOING DAMAGE TO THEIR BODY
trainval/OFbF16DVTXY/50004 IT TRULY FEELS LIKE A DREAM
trainval/OFbF16DVTXY/50006 SO I CHALLENGE ALL OF YOU
trainval/ofjRnIpXBF0/50001 I WAS AT A PARENT TEACHER CONFERENCE AND A PARENT APPROACHED MY TABLE
trainval/ofjRnIpXBF0/50002 THIS WAS THE SECOND TIME IN THREE YEARS THAT I HAD A STUDENT WHO IS SUICIDAL AND THERE WERE NO
trainval/ofjRnIpXBF0/50003 THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE LABEL FAILING STUDENTS AS FAILURES
trainval/ofjRnIpXBF0/50004 LAST JANUARY MY STUDENT WHO ATTEMPTED SUICIDE RETURNED FROM WINTER BREAK WITH A GIFT FOR ME
trainval/OfL5JmZnkI8/50001 TO PRESENT THE CHILD'S VOICE IN COURT
trainval/ofsncCF9OSU/50001 HOW HARD A PROCESS IS THAT
trainval/ofsncCF9OSU/50002 BUT IT JUST REQUIRES NOW AN INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES AND TRANSFER OF EXPERTISE
trainval/Ogce5D2XMZ0/50001 BUT BEST OF ALL WE'VE MADE A SMALL DENT A VERY SMALL DENT IN THE WORLDWIDE PLASTIC
trainval/Ogce5D2XMZ0/50002 I HAD NO ROLE MODELS ABSOLUTELY NONE
trainval/Ogce5D2XMZ0/50003 THAT'S ALMOST TWICE AS MANY AS WE HAVE TODAY
trainval/Ogce5D2XMZ0/50004 70 PERCENT SUCCESS RATE
trainval/Ogce5D2XMZ0/50005 WE'RE LIKE THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS OF ENTREPRENEURS {LG}
trainval/ogeGJS0GEF4/50001 THESE WERE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ALL ABOUT HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW YOUR COUNTRY
trainval/ogeGJS0GEF4/50002 I WANTED EVERYONE TO ENGAGE WITH IT
trainval/ogeGJS0GEF4/50003 WAS MORE THAN I COULD HAVE HOPED FOR
trainval/OGhbCC9mNM8/50001 THERE HAVE BEEN AMAZING ACHIEVEMENTS BY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ORGANIZATIONS STATES' ENVIRONMENTAL
trainval/OGhbCC9mNM8/50002 IT WAS WHEN I SPENT TIME SAILING ON THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA AND I SAW MORE WASTE FLOATING AROUND IN
trainval/OGhbCC9mNM8/50003 IT SHOULD NOT BE OUR OBJECTIVE TO HAVE GOOD LAWS OR GOOD POLICIES IT SHOULD BE OUR OBJECTIVE TO HAVE
trainval/OGhbCC9mNM8/50004 WE REALIZED THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE VERY WILLING TO CONTRIBUTE TO MEANINGFUL CHANGE
trainval/OGhbCC9mNM8/50005 JUST TO BE CLEAR WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO RECEIVING DONATIONS {LG}
trainval/oGlsUYGMYks/50001 S WANT TO TALK AND FLIRT WITH THE FEMALE C
trainval/oGlsUYGMYks/50002 THEY PLAY THE LITTLE HIGH SCHOOL KID GAMES WITH EACH OTHER
trainval/oGu0Ouxb3b8/50001 ALL OF US HERE ARE SO FOCUSED ON FINDING SOMEBODY ELSE TO BLAME FOR OUR OWN ACTIONS THAT WE HAVE FAILED TO
trainval/oGu0Ouxb3b8/50003 BUT GENERATION Y HAS BEEN CATAPULTED INTO A WORLD WHERE REALITY HAS BEEN PUT IN FAVOR OF OUR DREAMS
trainval/oGu0Ouxb3b8/50004 AND SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINES WE STOPPED BEING YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR GRANDCHILDREN AND INSTEAD
trainval/ogXTSCI7KRU/50001 OFF SUSTAINABLE ARCHITECTURE TO PORTRAIT SCIENCE FICTION
trainval/OH0dK208MNk/50001 SO THAT BEGAN AN EIGHT YEAR COLLABORATION TO CREATE A PLAY WHICH NOT ONLY FURTHER DEVELOPED OUR SYSTEM FOR SWITCHING BUT ALSO
trainval/OH0dK208MNk/50002 THIS ISN'T THE PRESENT
trainval/OH0dK208MNk/50003 RESPECT IT REVIVE IT GREAT
trainval/OH0dK208MNk/50004 BUT KNOW THAT THIS IS HISTORY
trainval/OH0dK208MNk/50005 THIS DOESN'T REPRESENT HOW WE THINK TODAY
trainval/OH0dK208MNk/50006 SO WE ASKED OURSELVES
trainval/OH0dK208MNk/50007 WATCH WHAT'S NOT
trainval/OH0dK208MNk/50008 NOW YOU JUST SAW TWO MAN DANCING TOGETHER
trainval/OH0dK208MNk/50009 I MEAN ONE DAY WE WOULD SAY FOX TROT AND PEOPLE WERE LIKE FOXES TROTTING
trainval/OH0dK208MNk/50010 WITH THIS SIMPLE TWEAK THE DANCE MOVES FROM BEING A DICTATION TO A NEGOTIATION
trainval/OH0dK208MNk/50011 ANYONE CAN LEAD
trainval/OH0dK208MNk/50012 THE SECRET LIES IN WHAT MADE LISA SEE OUR INITIAL DEMONSTRATION AS POLITICAL
trainval/OH0dK208MNk/50013 IT WASN'T JUST THAT WE WERE SWITCHING LEAD AND FOLLOW IT'S THAT WE STAYED CONSISTENT IN OUR PRESENCE OUR PERSONALITY AND OUR
trainval/OHBaOyaltpU/50001 I GATHERED THE GIRLS AND WE RAN OUT
trainval/OHBaOyaltpU/50002 I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS GOING BUT GOING BACK WAS NOT AN OPTION
trainval/OHBaOyaltpU/50003 I LOVED MY NEW FOUND FREEDOM
trainval/oHBKqCI4Fgg/50001 AND THEN IT OCCURRED TO ME
trainval/oHBKqCI4Fgg/50002 AS HUMANS OUR INTELLIGENCE OUR SOCIAL CAPABILITIES AND OUR PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS ENABLE US TO WORK
trainval/oHDeULyOqmM/50001 SHE GREW UP IN NAZI GERMANY IN THE 30S AND THE 40S
trainval/oHDq1PcYkT4/50001 AND PERLMAN RETURNED MY PHONE CALL
trainval/oHDq1PcYkT4/50002 IT BREAKS DOWN THE FUNDAMENTALS THE CRITICAL ACTIONS A TEAM NEEDS TO GO THROUGH WHEN A WOMAN COMES IN IN
trainval/ohGMgSLJCjs/50001 YOU HAVE A DUTY TO PERFORM
trainval/ohGMgSLJCjs/50002 DO ANYTHING ELSE DO ANY NUMBER OF THINGS
trainval/ohGMgSLJCjs/50003 YOU HAVE A DUTY TO PERFORM AND YET IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS ONE TASK YOUR TIME HERE WILL HAVE BEEN WASTED
trainval/ohGMgSLJCjs/50004 WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT
trainval/ohGMgSLJCjs/50005 WHAT WAS RUMI TRYING TO TELL US
trainval/ohGMgSLJCjs/50006 EVERYBODY GOT ONE
trainval/ohGMgSLJCjs/50007 WHEN WE TRY AND LIVE SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE HAVE YOU EVER TRIED THAT
trainval/ohGMgSLJCjs/50008 WORE SOMEBODY ELSE'S CLOTHES DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY
trainval/ohGMgSLJCjs/50010 AND THIS WOMAN IN HER MID 50S LATE 60S STOOD UP AND SAID FROM TORONTO STOOD UP AND SAID
trainval/ohGMgSLJCjs/50012 I DON'T CARE
trainval/ohGMgSLJCjs/50013 AND I TOOK MY BASKET OF CHOCOLATES AND EVERY SINGLE PERSON I SAW THAT DAY I SAID TO THEM THE THING I
trainval/ohGMgSLJCjs/50014 AT LEAST IN BERKSHIRE COUNTY
trainval/ohGMgSLJCjs/50015 WHEN I WAS A EHM
trainval/ohGMgSLJCjs/50016 WE DON'T NECESSARILY MOVE FROM ALL OF THOSE VOICES WE CHOOSE THE ONES MOST WISELY OF COURSE THAT WE LIVE FROM AND
trainval/ohGMgSLJCjs/50017 WE ARE GOING HERE WE ARE GOING TO TALK DIRECTLY TO THE SCIENTIST AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO OTHER PARENTS ABOUT WHAT HAS TO
trainval/ohGMgSLJCjs/50018 I KNOW ABOUT OBESITY I'M A MEDICAL DOCTOR BUT I ALSO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE HUMAN CONDITION AND I CAN UNDERSTAND
trainval/ohGMgSLJCjs/50019 WHEN WE ARE AUTHENTIC WE ARE FREED UP TO CREATE BECAUSE WE AREN'T DAMPED DOWN
trainval/ohGMgSLJCjs/50020 WOULD YOU NOT
trainval/ohGMgSLJCjs/50021 REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE SIX
trainval/ohGMgSLJCjs/50022 THE STORY THE CATHOLIC CHURCH THE SON OF GOD THE MYSTERY THE RITUAL THE RITE THE INCENSE THE WHOLE THING LOVED IT ALL
trainval/ohGMgSLJCjs/50023 AND SO BY THE TIME I WAS EIGHT I'D SCREWED UP MY COURAGE ENOUGH TO GO TO THE NUNS AND SAY THE THING THAT HAD BEEN IN MY HEART
trainval/OhYvDS7qSV8/50001 IN FACT EVERY MAJOR HOUSEHOLD NAME IS ALLOWING YOU TO INTERACT WITH THEIR
trainval/oI7QJytJrco/50001 WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT
trainval/OibJT7GSwyo/50001 NOW SOME OF YOU IN THIS ROOM PROBABLY KNOW MY STORY
trainval/OibJT7GSwyo/50002 AT THE AGE OF 29
trainval/OibJT7GSwyo/50003 2 MILES EVERY SINGLE DAY
trainval/OibJT7GSwyo/50004 IT WAS MY PLAN
trainval/oIGBBPspTKM/50001 I HAD CALLED HER MY AUNTIE
trainval/oIGBBPspTKM/50002 IF THOSE WORKERS RUN AWAY THEY RISK BECOMING PART OF THE GREAT MASS OF UNDOCUMENTED
trainval/oIGBBPspTKM/50003 LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE
trainval/oIGBBPspTKM/50004 THEY WERE SENT ALL OVER THE STATES TO WORK IN HAWAII PINEAPPLE PLANTATIONS AND WASHINGTON APPLE ORCHARDS AND ANYWHERE THE WORK WAS
trainval/oIGBBPspTKM/50005 THEY'RE MIGRANTS PEOPLE OF COLOR
trainval/oIGBBPspTKM/50006 THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS
trainval/oIGBBPspTKM/50007 AND FOR POPULATIONS LIKE THESE THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS TOO OFTEN PART OF THE PROBLEM RATHER THAN THE
trainval/oimk352QvAg/50001 SO THE QUESTION IS
trainval/oimk352QvAg/50002 WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE FAT KID TO KEEP HIM FROM WATCHING KNIGHT RIDER RERUNS ALL DAY
trainval/oimk352QvAg/50003 THE BASS ISN'T NARROW ENOUGH
trainval/oimk352QvAg/50004 I DO BELIEVE THE SOUND ON THIS INSTRUMENT IS MUCH MORE INTERESTING THAN THE SOUND OF MY OWN VOICE
trainval/OISOhvOumT0/50001 THE RESULT IS BASICALLY A WORD PROCESSOR FOR GENES
trainval/OISOhvOumT0/50002 HOW DO YOU GET YOUR TRAIT TO SPREAD
trainval/OISOhvOumT0/50003 IN FACT IT'S WHY WE HAVE AN INVASIVE SPECIES PROBLEM
trainval/OISOhvOumT0/50004 SO THANK GOODNESS THEY CAN'T BE USED TO ENGINEER VIRUSES OR BACTERIA
trainval/OISOhvOumT0/50005 AND GIVEN THE NATURE OF GENE DRIVES THAT CONVERSATION HAS TO BE GLOBAL
trainval/oiVSHkItqxo/50001 YES BECAUSE MOST COMPANY FOUNDERS HAD A VERY STRONG BELIEF AND WILL TO
trainval/oiVSHkItqxo/50002 HELP PEOPLE WITHIN THESE COOPERATIONS TO LOOK OUT THEIR WINDOWS AND
trainval/oiVSHkItqxo/50003 WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF ACCOUNTANCY TODAY
trainval/oiZ42KUsxGo/50001 TELEVISION BROADCASTS IN THE UNITED STATES BEGAN IN 1928
trainval/oiZ42KUsxGo/50002 60 YEARS BEFORE WE HAD DESCRIPTIVE VIDEO SERVICE FOR BLIND PEOPLE
trainval/oiZ42KUsxGo/50003 BUT THE ONLY WAY TO ASSURE HIGH QUALITY REALTIME CLOSED CAPTIONING IS TO HIRE AND TRAIN
trainval/oiZ42KUsxGo/50004 IF YOU DON'T THINK THAT MAKES IT HARD FOR A DEAF PERSON TO FOLLOW A PROGRAM TRY WATCHING A TV
trainval/oiZ42KUsxGo/50005 IT'S TIME TO RETUNE REFOCUS AND REMEMBER WHO CLOSED CAPTIONING WAS CREATED
trainval/Oj8eFu72Sfc/50001 TO SEND MONEY WITHIN AFRICA THE COST IS EVEN HIGHER OVER 20 PERCENT
trainval/Oj8eFu72Sfc/50002 FOR EXAMPLE SENDING MONEY FROM BENIN TO NIGERIA
trainval/Oj8eFu72Sfc/50003 IT ALL GOES IN SUITCASES
trainval/Oj8eFu72Sfc/50004 AND WHAT IS WORSE MANY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ACTUALLY HAVE A BLANKET BAN ON
trainval/Oj8eFu72Sfc/50005 AT THE SAME TIME
trainval/oJfFMoAgbv8/50001 SO FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE YOU HAVE TO SAY OKAY THE BRAIN IS EVERYTHING BUT PERFECT
trainval/oJfFMoAgbv8/50002 MANY PEOPLE THINK IT ALL STARTS WITH DATA
trainval/oJfFMoAgbv8/50003 JUST LIKE THE BRAIN
trainval/oJfFMoAgbv8/50005 WHAT DO I MEAN BY MISTAKE
trainval/oJfFMoAgbv8/50006 WELL IT MEANS THAT WE CAN COME UP WITH A NEW THOUGHT A NEW ACTIVITY PATTERN WITHOUT KNOWING BEFORE
trainval/oJfFMoAgbv8/50007 HE MIGHT'VE HEARD THE WORD SMOKE DETECTOR ONLY ONCE OR TWICE BUT THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR HIM TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE
trainval/oJfFMoAgbv8/50008 EVERY EFFICIENT PROCEDURE WILL BE REPLACED BY ALGORITHMS EVENTUALLY
trainval/oJfFMoAgbv8/50009 READ SOMETHING YOU DISAGREE WITH HAVE A PRODUCTIVE ARGUMENT WITH A FRIEND TRY TO SEE THINGS FROM THE OTHER
trainval/oJfFMoAgbv8/50010 BUT THE OPPOSITE
trainval/OJptdCCrcr4/50001 SAME WEBSITE TWO DOMAIN DOORS
trainval/OJptdCCrcr4/50002 AND ONLY ONE
trainval/OKIyDMaxh4w/50001 MY POSITION THERE WAS GOING TO BE NOT ONLY CREMATING THE DEAD BUT ALSO PREPARING THE
trainval/OKIyDMaxh4w/50002 YOU GOT YOUR GRANDPA'S CORPSE IN YOUR HOUSE
trainval/OKIyDMaxh4w/50003 IN THE WEST WE HAVE NEVER HAD QUITE THIS CLOSE A RELATIONSHIP WITH DEATH AND I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT
trainval/OKIyDMaxh4w/50004 THE SECOND IS THAT FAMILIES ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BE INVOLVED THAT A FUNERAL DIRECTOR HAS TO
trainval/OKIyDMaxh4w/50005 THAT'S NOT TRUE EITHER
trainval/OKIyDMaxh4w/50006 IT WAS A PRETTY TAME UNCONTROVERSIAL VIDEO OR SO
trainval/OKIyDMaxh4w/50007 IN FACT WHAT HUMANS HAVE BEEN DOING FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS
trainval/OKIyDMaxh4w/50008 IN JEWISH CULTURE IT'S THE SHEMIRA' RESPECTFULLY GUARDING THE DEAD FROM THE TIME OF DEATH UNTIL THEY'RE
trainval/OKIyDMaxh4w/50009 YOU'D BE CRAZY TO PLAY WITH A DEAD PERSON LIKE A DOLL
trainval/OkKhI6St40w/50001 THEY WERE LOOKING THE NEXT KARMAPA AND I NOTICED THEY WERE TALKING TO MY MOM AND
trainval/OkKhI6St40w/50002 HOW DID THAT FEEL WHEN THEY CAME AND WHISKED YOU AWAY AND YOUR LIFESTYLE
trainval/OkKhI6St40w/50003 AND IMMEDIATELY A LOT OF DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITIES IN TERMS OF MY EDUCATION AND SO
trainval/OKNpguWW3Sk/50001 WE HAVE TO HAVE EVERY BIT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY APPLIED TO OUR FOOD SYSTEM AND WE HAVE TO PLANT FENCE ROW TO FENCE
trainval/OKNpguWW3Sk/50002 AND I WANTED TO BE PART OF THE TEAM THAT WAS GOING TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM AND I WANTED TO BE PART OF THE TEAM THAT WAS GOING TO CREATE
trainval/OKNpguWW3Sk/50003 EVERY INPUT EVERY RESOURCE AS MUCH WATER AS MUCH SOIL AS MUCH LAND AS WE POSSIBLY
trainval/OKNpguWW3Sk/50004 SO AS I WENT INTO THAT FIELD AND BECAME A GENETICIST AND WORKED TO BETTER IMPROVE
trainval/OKNpguWW3Sk/50005 TECHNOLOGY THAT IS PROVEN AND EFFECTIVE AND SAFE WE NOW ARE HAVING DEBATES ABOUT WALKING
trainval/OKNpguWW3Sk/50006 WE'RE NOW HAVING DEBATES ABOUT PERHAPS USING MORE LAND RESOURCES TO PRODUCE
trainval/okQXrB7ySAw/50001 THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF SUPPLIERS IN THERE
trainval/okQXrB7ySAw/50002 BUT THERE ARE COMPANIES
trainval/okQXrB7ySAw/50003 THAT'S MY SIMPLE UNDERSTANDING OF HUMAN RIGHTS
trainval/oKtALHe3Y9Q/50001 THE BLOOD DRAINS FROM HER FACE
trainval/oKtALHe3Y9Q/50002 THERE ARE LITERALLY NO WORDS RIGHT
trainval/oKtALHe3Y9Q/50003 MY FRIEND HAROLD FORD CALLS ME
trainval/oKtALHe3Y9Q/50004 OR HOW WAS THE CAKE
trainval/oKtALHe3Y9Q/50005 I DID NOT UNDERSTAND
trainval/oKtALHe3Y9Q/50006 BUT SHE KNEW
trainval/oKtALHe3Y9Q/50007 AND SHE LOOKED ME RIGHT IN THE EYE AND SHE SAID THEY WILL NOT ALWAYS TREAT YOU WELL
trainval/oKtALHe3Y9Q/50008 THERE IS SHOCK FOLLOWED BY A LONG SILENCE
trainval/oKtALHe3Y9Q/50009 AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU I ACTUALLY FOR A MOMENT WAS A BIT AFRAID
trainval/oKtALHe3Y9Q/50010 I CITE THOSE STATISTICS AROUND CORPORATE BOARD DIVERSITY BECAUSE THEY ARE REAL AND I STAND HERE TODAY
trainval/oKtALHe3Y9Q/50011 NOW COLOR BLINDNESS IN MY VIEW DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE'S NO RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND THERE'S
trainval/oKtALHe3Y9Q/50012 IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT AT ALL
trainval/oKtALHe3Y9Q/50013 SO I HAD AN IDEA
trainval/oKtALHe3Y9Q/50014 BUT I'LL BE THE FIRST ONE TO TELL YOU THIS SUBJECT MATTER CAN BE HARD AWKWARD
trainval/oKtALHe3Y9Q/50015 AND ONE DAY MY COACH HAD ME DO A DRILL WHERE I HAD TO SWIM TO ONE END OF A 25 METER POOL WITHOUT TAKING A
trainval/oKtALHe3Y9Q/50016 AND EVERY SINGLE TIME I FAILED I HAD TO START OVER
trainval/oKtALHe3Y9Q/50017 AND I FAILED A LOT
trainval/oKtALHe3Y9Q/50018 AND MY COACH LOOKED ME AT ME AND HE SAID MELLODY THAT WAS NOT A BREATH HOLDING EXERCISE
trainval/oKtALHe3Y9Q/50019 THAT DRILL WAS TO MAKE YOU COMFORTABLE BEING UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE THAT'S HOW MOST OF US SPEND OUR
trainval/oKtALHe3Y9Q/50020 I CALLED A FRIEND WHO WAS IN NEW YORK AT ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MEDIA COMPANIES IN THE WORLD AND SHE
trainval/oKtALHe3Y9Q/50021 WE HAVE TO BE COLOR BRAVE
trainval/oKtALHe3Y9Q/50022 AND THE SMALLPOX VACCINATION IS BOVINE BASED BECAUSE OF THAT DAIRY FARMER
trainval/oKtALHe3Y9Q/50023 WHAT CAN I DO
trainval/oKtALHe3Y9Q/50024 IF YOU'RE PART OF A HIRING PROCESS OR AN ADMISSIONS PROCESS YOU CAN BE COLOR BRAVE
trainval/oKtALHe3Y9Q/50025 WE SHOW COURAGE
trainval/oKtALHe3Y9Q/50026 AS CITIZENS I'M ASKING YOU NOT TO LEAVE ANY CHILD BEHIND
trainval/OLHh9E5ilZ4/50001 PER CAPITA FOOD PRODUCTION IS UP BY A THIRD
trainval/OLHh9E5ilZ4/50002 THEY'RE BOTH EXACTLY THE SAME SIZE AND SHAPE TO AN UNCANNY DEGREE
trainval/OLHh9E5ilZ4/50003 HOMO ERECTUS MADE THE SAME TOOL FOR 30000 GENERATIONS
trainval/OLHh9E5ilZ4/50004 IN THIS CASE CHIMPANZEES TEACHING EACH OTHER HOW TO CRACK NUTS WITH ROCKS
trainval/OLHh9E5ilZ4/50005 SO THE GAINS FROM TRADE ARE ONLY GOING TO GROW
trainval/OLHh9E5ilZ4/50006 HOW LONG IS IT GOING TO TAKE YOU
trainval/OLHh9E5ilZ4/50007 QUITE A LONG TIME
trainval/OLHh9E5ilZ4/50008 THERE WILL BE WARS THERE WILL BE DEPRESSIONS THERE WILL BE NATURAL DISASTERS
trainval/OLHh9E5ilZ4/50009 AWFUL THINGS WILL HAPPEN IN THIS CENTURY I'M ABSOLUTELY SURE
trainval/OLHh9E5ilZ4/50010 THEY WERE IMAGINATIVE
trainval/OLHh9E5ilZ4/50011 FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CAUCASUS THERE'S A SITE WHERE YOU FIND LOCAL NEANDERTHAL TOOLS
trainval/OLHh9E5ilZ4/50012 THEY'RE ALWAYS MADE FROM LOCAL CHERT
trainval/OLHh9E5ilZ4/50013 AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE BECAUSE WE'RE ALL WORKING FOR EACH OTHER
trainval/OLHh9E5ilZ4/50014 WITH LANGUAGE WE HAVE TO TRANSFER IDEAS THAT WE UNDERSTAND WITH EACH OTHER
trainval/OlLFK8oSNEM/50001 ONE OF MY GREATEST PLEASURES IN LIFE IS I HAVE TO ADMIT A BIT SPECIAL
trainval/OlLFK8oSNEM/50002 I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MUCH I ENJOY WATCHING CITIES FROM THE SKY FROM AN AIRPLANE
trainval/OlLFK8oSNEM/50003 BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR TRAFFIC IS FOCUSED ON THE GROUND ON THE SURFACE
trainval/OlLFK8oSNEM/50004 LET'S DO IT
trainval/oLomVgNbNV8/50001 WHO'S THAT PERSON
trainval/oLomVgNbNV8/50002 THESE VIDEOS DON'T TELL SOMEONE'S WHOLE STORY
trainval/olPn5xr0L08/50001 BUT THE THING IS I DIDN'T GET HERE BY MYSELF AND I CERTAINLY DIDN'T GET HERE OVERNIGHT
trainval/olPn5xr0L08/50002 WE NEED TO CREATE A SPACE TO TALK ABOUT THE THINGS IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT HAVEN'T BEEN SPOKEN ABOUT TO TALK ABOUT THE HOMOPHOBIC
trainval/olPn5xr0L08/50003 WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THOSE THINGS THAT WE'RE AFRAID OF WE NEED TO CREATE A SPACE WHERE WE CAN BE WHOLE
trainval/olPn5xr0L08/50004 A FATHER SHARED HIS JOURNEY WITH HIS DAUGHTER ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE IN HOW HE'D NEVER THOUGHT HE'D BE ABLE TO GET IT BUT
trainval/olPn5xr0L08/50005 AND BECAUSE OF FAMILY BREAKDOWN LGBT HOMELESSNESS IN YOUTH IS AT A RECORD NUMBER BUT WE
trainval/olPn5xr0L08/50006 AND ISN'T THAT WHAT WE WANT TO SEE
trainval/olPn5xr0L08/50007 I KNOW IT FEELS HARD RIGHT NOW BUT YOU WILL GET STRONGER
trainval/olPn5xr0L08/50008 YOU WILL FIND PEACE
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50001 SO WELL I KEPT RUNNING
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50002 HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHY PEOPLE SAY WE ARE THE CHOICES OF OUR LIVES
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50003 AND THAT MOMENT IN MY LIFE DIDN'T CHANGE THAT
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50004 THAT MOMENT WHAT IT CHANGED IS THAT I COULD BE WRONG
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50005 SOMETHING THAT I'LL TELL LATER
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50006 I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50007 I WAS JUST A STUDENT
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50009 IT'S WHERE LOGIC IS WHERE LANGUAGE IS WHERE THE REASON WHAT MAKES
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50010 IN THAT MOMENT HE HAD TO USE THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX AND THINK
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50011 IS THIS REAL
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50013 BECAUSE THEY USED AGAIN THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50014 HOW TO CREATE A FLYING MACHINE
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50015 THEY ARE THE NEURONS IN CHARGE OF PREDICTING THE FUTURE
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50016 BUT HOW DOES THIS WORK
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50017 HOW DO WE REALLY MAKE DECISIONS
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50019 AND THEN WE CREATE IN OUR BRAIN A LOT OF DOPAMINE SO WE FEEL GOOD WE
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50020 AND THEN YOU FEEL BAD FRUSTRATED
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50021 BUT SOMETHING MAGICAL HAPPENS IN THAT MOMENT
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50022 WELL BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID OF FAILING
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50023 YOU FEEL BAD BUT SOMETHING WORSE HAPPENS
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50024 YOU WILL SAY BUT THEY ARE NOT REAL
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50025 A LOT OF PEOPLE NEVER TALK IN PUBLIC BUT THEY KNOW FOR SURE THAT THEY AREN'T GOOD AT IT
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50026 YOU ARE NOT CREATING DOPAMINE YOU ARE NOT CREATING SEROTONINE
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50027 HOW IS YOUR EXAM
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50029 BUT COME ON I KNOW THAT YOU TRIED HARD YOU STUDIED A LOT
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50030 VERY BAD FOR HIM
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50031 THE FIRST ONE WAS
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50033 AND YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50034 SHE DOESN'T LIKE ME
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50035 WE THINK THAT OUR PAST EXPERIENCES TELL A LOT ABOUT THE FUTURE
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50036 AND IT'S NOT TRUE
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50037 THE FUTURE CAN CHANGE IN ANY MOMENT
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50038 LET'S BEGIN WITH THE BAD NEWS
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50039 YOU CAN CHOOSE WHAT TO DECIDE
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50040 SO WHAT CAN WE DO
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50041 WHAT IS CALLED
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50042 DO A REALITY CHECK
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50043 WHY ISN'T IT THAT EASY
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50044 WHAT IS THE PROBLEM
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50045 TO BE SURE ABOUT THINGS
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50046 YOU NEED TO BE SURE
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50047 I NEED TO BE SURE ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50049 YOU CAN ASK YOURSELF HOW DO I KNOW THAT THINGS ARE GOING TO BE WRONG
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50050 HOW CAN I BE SO SURE ABOUT SOMETHING
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50051 THAT'S THE FIRST THING
trainval/om6SewSRwtU/50053 THE SECOND TIP IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT
trainval/omGbKQIzoWY/50001 IT'S IMPORTANT FOR DEVELOPING IMAGINATION AND HAVING AN IMAGINATIVE MIND IS
trainval/oml5JLFKgH8/50001 WHAT FACTORS AND WHAT MOUNTS ARE NEEDED TO GUIDE AND REGENERATE NEURAL STEM CELLS
trainval/OmMv9tShW8k/50001 BUT I BELIEVE THAT ORCAS DON'T BELONG IN CAPTIVITY BECAUSE THIS DESTROYS FAMILY
trainval/ONXYcNS7k1Y/50001 WE'VE QUESTIONED THE FUTURE OF CAPITALISM
trainval/ONXYcNS7k1Y/50002 WE'VE QUESTIONED THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY
trainval/ONXYcNS7k1Y/50003 WE BOUGHT EXTRA LARGE CARS SUPERSIZED EVERYTHING WE BOUGHT REMEDIES FOR RESTLESS
trainval/ONXYcNS7k1Y/50004 ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER BASICALLY CREATED A FACTOR WHERE THE CONSUMER DROVE US HEADLONG INTO THE
trainval/ONXYcNS7k1Y/50005 WE'VE LOOKED AT OUR GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT
trainval/ONXYcNS7k1Y/50006 SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT THE CONTEXT THE CASUALNESS WITH WHICH WE TALK ABOUT TRILLION DOLLAR BAILOUT HERE AND TRILLION THERE
trainval/ONXYcNS7k1Y/50007 WE'VE QUESTIONED WHERE WE'RE GOING
trainval/ONXYcNS7k1Y/50008 7 PERCENT DECLINE
trainval/ONXYcNS7k1Y/50009 AND WE'RE STARTING TO BE MUCH MORE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW WE SAVE AND INVEST
trainval/ONXYcNS7k1Y/50010 LET'S TALK ABOUT DENTISTS VASECTOMIES GUNS AND SHARK ATTACKS
trainval/ONXYcNS7k1Y/50011 BUT THE ONE THING HOLDING THEM BACK IS THE ABILITY TO DISCRIMINATE
trainval/ONXYcNS7k1Y/50012 YOU SEE THIS RISING FORCE IN TOTAL TRANSPARENCY AND OPENNESS THAT COMPANIES ARE STARTING TO ADOPT
trainval/ONXYcNS7k1Y/50013 IT'S BEEN TREMENDOUSLY POWERFUL FOR CONSUMERS
trainval/ONXYcNS7k1Y/50014 BUT AT THE SAME TIME THIS IS ALSO A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY
trainval/ONXYcNS7k1Y/50015 CONTINUING EDUCATION IS UP
trainval/ONXYcNS7k1Y/50016 EVERYTHING IS FOCUSED ON BETTERMENT TRAINING DEVELOPMENT AND MOVING FORWARD
trainval/ONXYcNS7k1Y/50017 THAT INCLUDES COTTAGES AND THE LIKE BUT 30 PERCENT
trainval/ONXYcNS7k1Y/50018 PEOPLE ARE GETTING THEIR HANDS DIRTY ROLLING UP THEIR SLEEVES
trainval/ONXYcNS7k1Y/50019 THEY WANT THESE SKILLS
trainval/ONXYcNS7k1Y/50020 YOU ACTUALLY NEED TO ORGANIZE IT
trainval/ONXYcNS7k1Y/50021 WELL THEY HAVE A LOT BECAUSE IT'S THEIR NETWORK OF PEOPLE
trainval/ONXYcNS7k1Y/50022 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/oOE0kKteWkg/50001 SO WHAT HAVE I BEEN DOING
trainval/oOE0kKteWkg/50002 THAT IS IT'S WHAT THE BACTERIA ARE ABLE TO TURN ON ONCE THE GENE HAS ENTERED THEIR CELL
trainval/oOE0kKteWkg/50003 IT'S MORE THERMODYNAMICALLY FAVORABLE FOR THEM TO AVOID WATER
trainval/oOE0kKteWkg/50004 THEY'RE SO HYDROPHOBIC THERE'S NO WAY FOR THEM TO HIDE ALL OF THE HYDROPHOBIC BITS
trainval/oOE0kKteWkg/50005 HOPEFULLY ONE WOULD SOON BE ABLE TO FIND A VARIATION WHICH WAS AGAIN ABLE TO ACT AGAINST THE RESISTANCE BACTERIA
trainval/OOG65rSM5fA/50001 THE STRING HAS BEEN LACERATED
trainval/OOG65rSM5fA/50002 I WOULD EXPLAIN WHY I THINK THIS IS A LOUSY TRICK
trainval/OOG65rSM5fA/50003 I THINK IT'S A LOUSY TRICK BECAUSE AT ITS CORE IT'S JUST A PUZZLE
trainval/OOG65rSM5fA/50004 I WILL START WITH A CHEAP VISUAL STUNT TO GRAB YOUR ATTENTION AND COVER THE FACT THAT MY ACT IS
trainval/OOhgwjEnfAA/50001 SO I'D LIKE TO TRY IT AGAIN
trainval/OOhgwjEnfAA/50002 SO THAT TIME WAS PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT EASIER THAN THE FIRST BUT I'D LIKE TO TRY IT AGAIN JUST TWICE MORE
trainval/OOhgwjEnfAA/50003 WE SOMETIMES MISTAKENLY CALL THE ENTIRE GENITAL REGION THE VAGINA BUT REALLY THIS IS
trainval/OOhgwjEnfAA/50004 IS ACTUALLY CALLED THE VULVA
trainval/ooIxHVXgLbc/50001 EIGHT SAIL CHANGES IN 12 HOURS
trainval/ooIxHVXgLbc/50002 THERE IS NO MORE
trainval/ooIxHVXgLbc/50003 THESE FIGURES COULDN'T BE EXACT BUT WE KNEW THOSE MATERIALS WERE FINITE
trainval/ooIxHVXgLbc/50004 AND YET OUR SPEED THAT WE'VE USED THESE MATERIALS HAS INCREASED RAPIDLY EXPONENTIALLY
trainval/ooIxHVXgLbc/50005 IT FELT LIKE WE WERE BUYING OURSELVES TIME
trainval/ooIxHVXgLbc/50006 WE WERE EKING THINGS OUT A BIT LONGER
trainval/ooIxHVXgLbc/50007 EVEN IF EVERYBODY CHANGED IT WOULDN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM
trainval/ooIxHVXgLbc/50008 WE KNEW EXACTLY WHERE WE WERE HEADED
trainval/ooUqOwhS2LE/50002 MAYBE SHE HAD BEEN DARED TO DO THIS
trainval/ooUqOwhS2LE/50003 AND WE'RE NEVER GIVEN A REASON WHY WE SHOULD PLAY
trainval/ooUqOwhS2LE/50004 WE DON'T NEED A REASON
trainval/ooUqOwhS2LE/50005 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/oPBC15XYl3Q/50001 I WOULD BE STANDING ON IT AND RECITE POEMS
trainval/oPBC15XYl3Q/50002 AND THEN I GOT AN ICE CREAM
trainval/oPBC15XYl3Q/50003 I GOT LOTS OF ICE CREAM IN MY YOUTH
trainval/oPBC15XYl3Q/50004 THEY TURNED AN OLD VEGETABLE BOX UPSIDE DOWN I'M STANDING ON IT RECITING A POEM AND I HOPEFULLY GET AN ICE CREAM
trainval/oPBC15XYl3Q/50005 THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS
trainval/oPBC15XYl3Q/50006 WE ALL BECAME THE PEOPLE WE ARE THANKS TO POSITIVE STRENGTH THANKS TO SOMEONE WHO TOLD
trainval/oPBC15XYl3Q/50007 NAMASTE MEANS THREE THINGS
trainval/oPBC15XYl3Q/50008 I'VE SEEN YOU
trainval/oPBC15XYl3Q/50009 I'VE SEEN YOU
trainval/oPBC15XYl3Q/50010 THERE IS A POSITIVE STRENGTH IN YOU
trainval/oPBC15XYl3Q/50011 I BOW DEEPLY FOR THAT
trainval/oPBC15XYl3Q/50012 LIFE IS NOT A PARTY
trainval/oPBC15XYl3Q/50013 I'M NOT DRIVING THE COUNTRY IN A CAR FULL OF BALLOONS
trainval/oPBC15XYl3Q/50014 WE ALL HAVE THAT
trainval/oPBC15XYl3Q/50016 WE KNOW THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OPTIMISM AND HAPPINESS IS QUITE
trainval/oPBC15XYl3Q/50017 WHEN YOU SMOKE YOU GET LUNG CANCER
trainval/oPBC15XYl3Q/50018 WHEN YOU ARE AN OPTIMIST YOU BECOME HAPPY
trainval/oPBC15XYl3Q/50019 AND WHEN YOU'RE HAPPIER YOU'RE HEALTHIER AND SUCCESSFUL IN SPORTS IN SCIENCE IN FRIENDSHIP
trainval/oPBC15XYl3Q/50020 WE ALL ARE AMBASSADORS OF SOME STRENGTH
trainval/oPDaWYUCn8Y/50001 YOU CAN SLIP AND FALL
trainval/oPDaWYUCn8Y/50002 I'M GOING TO MAKE A CHANGE
trainval/oPDaWYUCn8Y/50003 NOT ONE CAT
trainval/oPpE0AGqFuk/50001 YOU KNOW TRAFFIC LIGHTS
trainval/oPpE0AGqFuk/50002 MY DAD TOLD ME THIS YEARS AGO
trainval/oPpE0AGqFuk/50003 BOTH BIG AND MEANINGFUL AND WE NEED THOSE INITIATIVES
trainval/oPpE0AGqFuk/50005 AND RONNIE DOUGLAS SAID THE SAME THING
trainval/OPtxa35JU6Y/50001 ONE DAY WHEN I WAS A SPECIAL EDUCATION HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER I WAS TEACHING A STUDY SKILLS CLASS
trainval/OPtxa35JU6Y/50002 AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THREE STORIES ABOUT HOW THAT TOOL IS BEING USED IN THE WORLD
trainval/OPtxa35JU6Y/50003 FIRST I WOULD HAVE CHANGED THE TITLE SO THAT IT RELATED TO MY CLASS
trainval/OPtxa35JU6Y/50004 BUT THE POINT IS THAT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE WATCHED THIS VIDEO BECAUSE ELLEN'S DAD HAPPENS TO BE A
trainval/OPtxa35JU6Y/50005 I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO INTO EACH OF THEM BUT THINK OF THAT SIDE MATERIAL THAT SIDEBAR AS AN
trainval/OPtxa35JU6Y/50006 SO THERE ARE 1200 OF PEOPLE AT THIS TEDX EVENT
trainval/OPtxa35JU6Y/50007 I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT BUT MY STAFF IS REALLY EXCITED TO WORK TOWARDS
trainval/OPtxa35JU6Y/50008 I THINK THAT THE NEXT TEACHER OR STUDENT THAT PARTICIPATES IN TED ED WILL BE TOO
trainval/orumugzJpt0/50001 BUT WHEN SHE SEES MIKE TAKING GIRLS HOME FROM PARTIES SHE'S WORRIED ABOUT THEM
trainval/orumugzJpt0/50002 SO THIS TO ME IS A TRAGIC BUT A SOLVABLE PROBLEM
trainval/orumugzJpt0/50003 AND SO WE DID
trainval/orumugzJpt0/50004 WE STARTED BY TALKING TO COLLEGE SURVIVORS
trainval/orumugzJpt0/50005 IT CHANGES THE WAY YOU FRAME YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE IT CHANGES THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR PERPETRATOR IT MEANS THAT IF
trainval/orumugzJpt0/50006 LET'S CALL HIM MIKE
trainval/ORvwzoSf1Sc/50001 HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE USED AN ELECTRONIC SPREADSHEET LIKE MICROSOFT EXCEL
trainval/ORvwzoSf1Sc/50002 I TRIED THAT
trainval/ORvwzoSf1Sc/50003 RESTRICTING YOU TO A GRID HELPED SOLVE MY PROBLEM
trainval/oS4R8TG9e5Y/50001 EVEN IF YOU LOCK YOUR DOOR TIME WILL BREAK INSIDE AND ROB YOU OFF YOUR BREATH
trainval/oS4R8TG9e5Y/50002 I HAVE NO EVIDENCE TO PROVE THIS TO BE UNTRUE
trainval/osBbP6Om4Mg/50001 SO ABOUT HALF A MILLION PEOPLE DIE IN THE UK EACH YEAR AND OF THOSE AROUND A QUARTER
trainval/osBbP6Om4Mg/50002 IN FACT THE SURPRISING THING IS THAT THERE'S NO LEGAL OBLIGATION ON ANYONE IN THE UK TO PROVIDE
trainval/osBbP6Om4Mg/50003 BUT ANYWAY THE COUNCIL GRANTED THESE PEOPLE PERMISSION AND THEY'RE NOW TRYING TO BUILD THEIR CEMETERY
trainval/osBbP6Om4Mg/50004 BUT THEY'LL ALSO THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE WHAT IMPACT IS IT GOING TO HAVE ON THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT
trainval/osBbP6Om4Mg/50005 AND THEY'LL WEIGH UP THE ADVANTAGES AND THE DISADVANTAGES AND THEY'LL MAKE A DECISION
trainval/osBbP6Om4Mg/50006 BUT WHAT IF I'VE GOT A PIECE OF LAND AND I JUST WANT TO BURY A FEW PEOPLE LIKE FIVE OR SIX
trainval/osBbP6Om4Mg/50007 THEY ALSO TELL YOU THAT YOU NEED TO KEEP A RECORD OF WHERE THE GRAVE IS
trainval/osBbP6Om4Mg/50008 BUT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT FOR FORMAL REQUIREMENTS
trainval/osBbP6Om4Mg/50009 I'M AN ARCHITECT AND URBAN DESIGNER AND FOR THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT APPROACHES TO DEATH AND
trainval/osBbP6Om4Mg/50011 THAT NO ONE WILL WANT TO BUY YOUR HOUSE AT ALL AFTER THAT
trainval/osBbP6Om4Mg/50012 AND THE REASONS THAT PEOPLE GIVE
trainval/osBbP6Om4Mg/50013 AND YOU KNOW TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE TAKING CARE OF THINGS FOR US
trainval/osBbP6Om4Mg/50014 THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALL THIS REGULATION AND BUREAUCRACY AROUND THINGS LIKE BURYING A DEATH FOR EXAMPLE
trainval/osBbP6Om4Mg/50015 BUT WHEN IT COMES TO OUR CITIES AND THINKING ABOUT HOW DEATH FITS IN OUR CITIES THERE'S MUCH LESS
trainval/osBbP6Om4Mg/50016 SO WE'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT THIS BUT ALL OF THE PEOPLE WE IMAGINE ARE THINKING ABOUT IT THEY'RE NOT TAKING
trainval/OSGHRMKrVM8/50001 AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
trainval/OSz2v42F0E0/50002 PEOPLE WILL THINK IT'S CUTE
trainval/OSz2v42F0E0/50003 NOW THE SHOW IS MARKETED TO GIRLS AGES FIVE TO NINE BUT THERE ARE MILLIONS OF BOYS
trainval/OSz2v42F0E0/50004 AND THAT IS NOT MIKE'S FAULT
trainval/OSz2v42F0E0/50005 THAT IS OUR FAULT
trainval/OSz2v42F0E0/50006 AND PLEASE BUY THEM
trainval/OSz2v42F0E0/50007 AND DON'T JUST BUY THEM FOR YOUR DAUGHTERS BUY THEM FOR YOUR SONS
trainval/OSz2v42F0E0/50008 BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT BOYS PLAY WITH AND AS FEMALE SUPERHEROES JUST AS MY DAUGHTER
trainval/OT9poHSD2Iw/50001 BUT THEN I HEAR PEOPLE SAYING THERE IS NO PROGRESS IN AFRICA
trainval/OT9poHSD2Iw/50003 IF THEY DIED AT WHAT AGE AND WHAT YEAR
trainval/OT9poHSD2Iw/50004 AND THERE WAS SOCIO ECONOMIC PROBLEMS WHICH ARE NOW BEING SOLVED AT A MUCH BETTER SCALE
trainval/OT9poHSD2Iw/50005 NOW THIS SOUNDS A LITTLE THEORETICAL BUT IT'S NOT SO THEORETICAL
trainval/OT9poHSD2Iw/50006 WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MANAGE THE ENVIRONMENT AND AVOID THE TERRIBLE CLIMATE CRISIS IF WE DON'T STABILIZE THE WORLD
trainval/OT9poHSD2Iw/50007 LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT
trainval/OT9poHSD2Iw/50010 IT'S NOT ABOUT JUST FIVE YEARS IT'S LONG TERM INVESTMENTS
trainval/OT9poHSD2Iw/50011 AND THEN THEY GOT THE ASWAN DAM
trainval/OT9poHSD2Iw/50012 THEY GET SAMSUNG HOW CAN THEY BE A DEVELOPING COUNTRY
trainval/OT9poHSD2Iw/50013 THEY HAVE HERE SINGAPORE
trainval/OT9poHSD2Iw/50014 WE HAVE TO HAVE A MODERN CONCEPT WHICH FITS TO THE DATA
trainval/OT9poHSD2Iw/50015 THAT IS WHEN WE GET GIRLS IN SCHOOL WE'LL GET AN IMPACT 15 TO 20 YEARS LATER WHICH IS A
trainval/oTHSfmQo3Ok/50001 SO THE BEST THE CHEAPEST WE CAN DO FOR RAW DNA SYNTHESIS IS ON THE ORDER OF 100 TO 200 BASE
trainval/oTHSfmQo3Ok/50002 BUT WE HAVE VARIOUS TOOLS YOU'VE SEEN SOME ALREADY NOT IN JUST MY TALK IN OTHERS WHERE CAN TEST
trainval/OtNpDaQqNSQ/50001 AND MY FRIEND SAID
trainval/OtNpDaQqNSQ/50002 WHAT WERE ALL THOSE RENAISSANCES ABOUT THOUGH
trainval/OtUSnXV0i4E/50001 YOU'LL TO HAVE TO PARDON THE SOUND QUALITY BECAUSE AGAIN THESE WERE HIDDEN CAMERAS
trainval/OtUSnXV0i4E/50002 AND THAT'S A REALLY REALLY INCREDIBLE INSIGHT INTO HOW THE MIND MAKES SENSE OF
trainval/OtUSnXV0i4E/50003 NOW IN CALIFORNIA AS YOU ALL KNOW BECAUSE I'M SURE WE ALL DO THIS IT'S THE LAW TO
trainval/OtUSnXV0i4E/50004 AFTER WATCHING THIS VIDEO AN HOUR LATER RICH PEOPLE BECAME JUST AS GENEROUS OF
trainval/ouXGIw7gBmk/50001 PEOPLE COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS BY CHANCE AND ACCIDENTALLY
trainval/ouXGIw7gBmk/50002 I'VE NEVER SEEN THE FILM BUT APPARENTLY IT'S A GOOD FILM
trainval/ouXGIw7gBmk/50003 BUT IT'S A SPANISH FILM AND THEY WERE LEARNING SPANISH AT THE TIME
trainval/ouXGIw7gBmk/50004 OF COURSE SUBTITLES USUALLY TRANSLATE INTO A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE NOT INTO THE SAME LANGUAGE
trainval/ouXGIw7gBmk/50005 AND YOU CAN'T SEE THEM BECAUSE THERE'S A POWER CUT
trainval/ouXGIw7gBmk/50006 IT ALL CHARGES UP WONDERFULLY THEN YOU BRING IN AT NIGHT AND IF YOU NEED TO DO AN OPERATION AT NIGHT THE
trainval/ouXGIw7gBmk/50007 AND WE GET THIS TOO IN THE SOCIAL INNOVATION SPACE
trainval/ouXGIw7gBmk/50008 AND WHEN WE END UP WITH TECHNOLOGY THAT WE CAN USE WITHOUT NECESSARILY ALWAYS HAVING TO REALLY MAKE IT WORK
trainval/ouXGIw7gBmk/50009 FRONTLINE SMS TODAY IS USED IN ABOUT 170 COUNTRIES 20 TO 30 MILLION PEOPLE ARE BENEFITING
trainval/ouXGIw7gBmk/50010 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/ouXGIw7gBmk/50011 AND PEOPLE BUILD SMARTPHONE APPS FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS ACROSS THE DEVELOPING WORLD THEY BUILD FARM MAPS THEY BUILD
trainval/oVE5rRJa0D8/50001 WILL COME AND IT DEVELOPS AND DEVELOPS AND IT'S GETTING BETTER AND BETTER
trainval/OVSNSeFTaso/50001 MY IGNORANT ARROGANT COARSENESS MY SECRET PRIDE MY TURNING
trainval/OVSNSeFTaso/50002 ALWAYS THAT EROTIC MURMUR I'M HARDLY MYSELF IF I'M NOT IN A STATE OF
trainval/OVSNSeFTaso/50003 I DON'T MEAN THAT FOR A MOMENT
trainval/ovV7v2XYJAI/50001 AND IF YOU THINK OF DOGS FOR EXAMPLE DOGS ARE NOW INTENTIONALLY DESIGNED CREATURES
trainval/ovV7v2XYJAI/50002 DOGS ARE THE RESULT OF SELECTIVELY BREEDING TRAITS THAT WE LIKE
trainval/ovV7v2XYJAI/50003 WE DON'T HAVE TO DO IT THAT WAY ANYMORE
trainval/ovV7v2XYJAI/50004 BUT SOMETHING MUCH MUCH MORE POWERFUL IS HAPPENING NOW
trainval/ovV7v2XYJAI/50005 WE HAVE TWO KINDS OF DNA IN OUR BODIES
trainval/ovV7v2XYJAI/50006 SO REALLY WHAT YOU END UP HAVING HERE IS NOT A GUAR AND NOT A MOUFLON BUT A
trainval/ovV7v2XYJAI/50007 THEY HAVE IT RUNNING THROUGH MAZES CONTROLLING WHERE IT'S GOING
trainval/ovV7v2XYJAI/50008 THEY'VE NOW CREATED AN ORGANIC ROBOT
trainval/ovV7v2XYJAI/50009 WE CAN MANIPULATE THE PLASMAS OF LIFE WITH UNPRECEDENTED POWER AND IT CONFERS ON US A
trainval/ovV7v2XYJAI/50010 IS EVERYTHING OKAY
trainval/oVw7HSe9Igo/50001 AND ONE DAY BOZO DID NOT COME BACK
trainval/oVw7HSe9Igo/50002 AND I WAITED FOR HIM
trainval/oVw7HSe9Igo/50003 I KNEW THAT I WAS GOING TO MAKE THIS FILM ABOUT WOLVES
trainval/oVw7HSe9Igo/50004 AND HE IS FROM THE RED LAKE NATION
trainval/oVw7HSe9Igo/50005 AT ONE TIME WOLVES OCCUPIED OVER 95 PERCENT OF THE NORTH AMERICAN LANDSCAPE
trainval/oW91ATcgXVc/50001 HOW DO YOU DEVELOP THE SKILLS TO DEVELOP THE RESILIENCE TO KEEP GOING WHEN LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES AND
trainval/oW91ATcgXVc/50002 BECAUSE A MARATHON DOESN'T GOOF AROUND
trainval/oW91ATcgXVc/50003 INFORMATION SUCH AS
trainval/oW91ATcgXVc/50005 SO WHAT HAPPENS
trainval/OwfyH5S6bpA/50001 YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT
trainval/OwfyH5S6bpA/50002 AND THE OTHER PEOPLE SAID OH MY GOD
trainval/OwfyH5S6bpA/50003 YOU'RE SO RESILIENT YOU SURVIVED
trainval/OwfyH5S6bpA/50004 THAT MEANS THAT I CAN'T CURE MY ABUSE AND THAT THERE WILL BE NO ESCAPING IT UNTIL I DIE
trainval/owl8keTUioo/50001 WHY IS THAT
trainval/owl8keTUioo/50002 AFRICA IS THE LARGEST ARABLE LAND MASS ON THE PLANET
trainval/owl8keTUioo/50003 A LACK OF PROGRESS IN THIS AREA HAS NOT BEEN FOR A LACK OF TRYING
trainval/owl8keTUioo/50004 DO YOU INVEST EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAVE ALL OF YOUR MONEY POTENTIALLY GOING EVEN FURTHER INTO DEBT INTO AN INVESTMENT IN
trainval/owl8keTUioo/50005 WHY IS THIS SUCH A COMPLEX PROBLEM
trainval/OWq7ToR2U8Q/50001 WHERE AM I FROM
trainval/OWq7ToR2U8Q/50002 I SAID BUT WHO'S TED
trainval/OWq7ToR2U8Q/50003 AND NO NO THE TED GROUP
trainval/OWq7ToR2U8Q/50004 YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT IT
trainval/OWq7ToR2U8Q/50005 HOW DO I KNOW WHO TED IS
trainval/OWq7ToR2U8Q/50006 EVEN MORE EXCITING
trainval/OWq7ToR2U8Q/50007 PERHAPS PART OF THIS JOURNEY IS ABOUT ME TRYING TO FIND OUT WHERE I BELONGED
trainval/OWq7ToR2U8Q/50008 PERHAPS I HAVE TO WORK HARDER AT FINDING A RITUAL WHICH MATTERS FOR ME AND GOING BACK INTO MY PAST TO SEE WHERE
trainval/OWq7ToR2U8Q/50009 THEN WE RESPECT
trainval/OwRAFCrsDS8/50001 SUDDENLY HE REMEMBERS THAT HE HAS SOMEONE TO HIS RIGHT
trainval/OwRAFCrsDS8/50002 THERE S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT LOYALTY THESE DAYS
trainval/OwRAFCrsDS8/50003 ACTUALLY 18 OF THEM LEAVE BECAUSE OF PRICE
trainval/OwRAFCrsDS8/50004 THE FACT THAT YOU MY CUSTOMER MY EMPLOYEE MY SPOUSE MY FRIEND THE FACT THAT YOU DON T HAVE REASONS TO
trainval/OwRAFCrsDS8/50005 DIFFERENT PEOPLE OF COURSE FIND DIFFERENT MEANINGS
trainval/OwRAFCrsDS8/50006 WHOEVER HAS A STRONG WHY' WILL BE ABLE TO ENDURE ALMOST ANY HOW
trainval/OwRAFCrsDS8/50007 THESE TREES WILL NEVER GROW ANY FURTHER AND THEY WILL ALMOST GIVE NO FRUIT
trainval/OwRAFCrsDS8/50008 ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN TO ONE OF MY COURSES WILL TELL YOU THAT I LOVE TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT TED AND I USE IT IN MY
trainval/OwRAFCrsDS8/50009 IT DOESN T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY
trainval/oX1C3Jn05OE/50001 AND I WAS LIKE
trainval/oX1C3Jn05OE/50002 YOU SAY HELLO
trainval/oX1C3Jn05OE/50003 IF YOU ARE A STIFF VESSEL THE MAGIC THE EMOTION WILL NOT COME OUT
trainval/oXbhTHaMwTw/50001 BUT THIS PHENOMENAL PROJECT'S BEEN HAPPENING
trainval/oxpJGynSHJU/50001 I'M AMAZED WHEN A SHOOTING STAR STREAKS ACROSS THE SKY
trainval/oxpJGynSHJU/50002 GRAVITATIONAL WAVES ARE RIPPLES IN THE CURVATURE OF SPACE TIME
trainval/OXQwtTOnLvg/50001 THE AVERAGE MAN IS STRONGER THAN 99
trainval/OXQwtTOnLvg/50002 SO THAT'S A BIG CHANGE
trainval/OXQwtTOnLvg/50004 SO HOW DID WE GET THERE
trainval/OXQwtTOnLvg/50005 SO MALE PROVISIONING BOTH POSSIBLE THROUGH HUNTING AND NECESSARY
trainval/OXQwtTOnLvg/50006 BUT THINK ABOUT WHAT IMPACT THIS WOULD HAVE
trainval/OXQwtTOnLvg/50007 AND WOMEN'S MATE PREFERENCES SIMILARLY CHANGE OVER THE CYCLE SO THAT THEY PREFER MORE DOMINANT MORE MASCULINE MALES
trainval/OXQwtTOnLvg/50009 IF WOMEN WERE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE ORGASMS WITH SOME MEN THAN OTHERS THEN THIS COULD BE A MECHANISM BY WHICH THEY
trainval/OXQwtTOnLvg/50010 SO THAT'S ONE POINT THAT I WANT TO MAKE
trainval/oXSyMUeAEec/50001 IT WAS THESE HANDS ON ACTIVITIES THAT I REMEMBER MOST AS A KID
trainval/oXSyMUeAEec/50002 IT'S WHAT I WANTED
trainval/oXSyMUeAEec/50003 I WENT TO A SCHOOL WHERE IT WAS UNUSUAL TO GO TO UNIVERSITY ESPECIALLY FOR A GIRL
trainval/oXSyMUeAEec/50004 I WAS TOLD THIS WAS A GREAT JOB AS IT WAS SECURE
trainval/oXSyMUeAEec/50005 IT'S LIKELY THAT ROBOTS AND AUTOMATION WILL REPLACE A LOT OF THEIR JOBS IN THE FUTURE
trainval/oXSyMUeAEec/50006 WE DON'T KNOW HOW FAR WE CAN GO WITH ROBOTICS TECHNOLOGY YET
trainval/oXSyMUeAEec/50007 OUR KIDS WILL SHOW US THAT
trainval/oXSyMUeAEec/50008 SO THE BENEFITS OF ROBOTS IN THE CLASSROOM ARE NOT JUST ABOUT KIDS ENGAGING WITH THE TECHNOLOGY
trainval/oXSyMUeAEec/50009 AND ROBOTS BELONG IN EVERY CLASSROOM BECAUSE THE HANDS ON ACTIVITIES CAN TRANSFORM LEARNING
trainval/oXSyMUeAEec/50010 BY INTERACTING WITH ROBOTS BY BUILDING ROBOTS BY MOVING AND PROGRAMMING ROBOTS KIDS ARE
trainval/oXSyMUeAEec/50011 THE HANDS ON APPLICATION OF THESE STEM CONCEPTS LETS THEM APPLY THEIR LEARNING AND BUILD THEIR UNDERSTANDING
trainval/oXSyMUeAEec/50013 THIS ALSO GIVES THEM AN APPRECIATION OF WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY
trainval/oXSyMUeAEec/50014 THEY ARE USING THEIR ROBOTS TO THINK WITH AND TO WORK TOGETHER TO PROBLEM SOLVE IN TEAMS AS THEY MAKE
trainval/oXSyMUeAEec/50015 BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO SEE IF A ROBOT MOVES THE WAY IT SHOULD THEY GET IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK ON WHETHER THEIR CODING
trainval/oXSyMUeAEec/50016 I WAS THAT KID WHO NOT ONLY SAW A FUTURE WITH ROBOTS BUT A FUTURE WHERE I WAS A TEACHER
trainval/oXSyMUeAEec/50017 I HAD SOME GREAT TEACHERS WHO REALLY INSPIRED ME
trainval/oXSyMUeAEec/50018 SO NEXT TIME YOU ARE TALKING TO A YOUNG PERSON DON'T ASK THEM WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP
trainval/oy25A7vnigg/50001 INSIDE THE ROLLS ROYCE IS THE QUEEN MOTHER
trainval/oy25A7vnigg/50003 SHE WAVES AND SHE SMILES
trainval/OyahH2o9AAk/50001 LIVING TO BE THAT OLD
trainval/OyahH2o9AAk/50002 UNDER THAT SCENARIO YOU COULD STILL BE AN INTERN WHEN YOU'RE 50 AND WHEN YOU REACH THE AGE OF 70 LEARN THAT YOU'RE ONLY
trainval/OyahH2o9AAk/50003 INSTEAD OF WAITING UNTIL THE FINAL CHAPTER OF LIFE TO RETIRE WE SHOULD TAKE SMALL INTERIM
trainval/OyahH2o9AAk/50004 DON'T PUT ALL OF YOUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET
trainval/OyahH2o9AAk/50005 SPREAD YOUR RISK AROUND
trainval/OyahH2o9AAk/50006 WHILE I HAD BEEN SAVING SOME MONEY FOR MY ULTIMATE RETIREMENT I HAD ALSO BEEN PUTTING MONEY ASIDE
trainval/OyahH2o9AAk/50007 INTUIT THE SOFTWARE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS
trainval/OyahH2o9AAk/50008 A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO PRUDENTIAL UNVEILED A BILLBOARD THAT SAID THAT THE FIRST PERSON WAS BORN WHO WILL
trainval/OyahH2o9AAk/50009 YOUR GOLDEN YEARS ARE RIGHT NOW
trainval/OyahH2o9AAk/50010 DON'T DO THAT
trainval/OyahH2o9AAk/50011 WHAT I'M SUGGESTING THAT YOU DO IS START TO THINK ABOUT YOUR LIFE STORY AND LOOK AT YOUR
trainval/OyPGDBOqPFs/50001 BUT SHE'D GIVEN THE BOYS GIRLS' NAMES AND THE GIRLS BOYS' NAMES
trainval/ozmowWZ1YYU/50001 ALREADY AT THE VERY EARLY STAGE OF FACE PROCESSING A SOCIAL CATEGORIZATION HAPPENS
trainval/ozmowWZ1YYU/50002 AND WHEN I SAY IT IS AN EVALUATION MIGHT IT NOT BE THAT EMOTIONS PLAY A ROLE IN THIS
trainval/OzvxbUnWJUc/50001 THEN WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN MY FAMILY MOVED TO CANADA FROM SOUTH AFRICA
trainval/OzvxbUnWJUc/50002 I HAD A FUNNY ACCENT I HAD MY NOSE IN THE BOOKS AND I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE
trainval/OzvxbUnWJUc/50003 IT WAS IN THOSE MOMENTS THAT I SPENT WITH MY FELLOW ACTORS IN THE DRAMA CLUB THAT MY PILOT LIGHT BEGAN TO BURN ITS STRONGEST
trainval/OzvxbUnWJUc/50004 THEY ALL REACTED EXACTLY THE SAME WAY
trainval/OzvxbUnWJUc/50005 JOSH THAT'S A WASTE OF YOUR INTELLECT
trainval/OzvxbUnWJUc/50006 YOU CAN BE ANYTHING
trainval/OzvxbUnWJUc/50007 ACTING IS A HOBBY NOT A JOB
trainval/OzvxbUnWJUc/50008 THINGS HAD COME TO A HEAD AND I WAS COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED I REACHED OUT AND I CALLED AN EMERGENCY HELPLINE
trainval/OzvxbUnWJUc/50009 I WANT TO PERFORM
trainval/OzvxbUnWJUc/50010 IT MADE ME REALIZE I COULD DO WHAT I LOVED
trainval/OzvxbUnWJUc/50011 I COULD FOLLOW THAT LIGHT THAT SHONE INSIDE ME
trainval/OzvxbUnWJUc/50012 ANY LAUGHING OR OVATION WOULD ENCOURAGE ME
trainval/p0aTfcXpOEs/50001 IT WAS THE FORMER THOUGH THEY CHECKED THE AREA AND IT WAS ACTUALLY THERE
trainval/p0aTfcXpOEs/50002 HANNY IS MY NAME AND VOORWERP IS THE SLIGHTLY BORING WORD FOR OBJECT
trainval/p0aTfcXpOEs/50003 IT'S ABOUT 650 MILLION LIGHT YEARS FROM EARTH
trainval/p0aTfcXpOEs/50004 IF YOU ARE A SCIENTIST AND YOU HAVE AN IDEA FOR A PROJECT FOR WHICH YOU WOULD NEED THE HELP OF ALL THESE
trainval/p0p45l9NMto/50001 THEY WON'T BE THERE
trainval/p0SwjVS9iSc/50001 THAT WAS MY THING
trainval/p1i6A7t6L2g/50001 AND THOSE INSIGHTS CAN BE YOURS
trainval/P1sbSJK1LiI/50001 BECAUSE IT WASN'T RED MARS IT WAS GRAY MATERIAL IT'S GRAY MARS
trainval/P1sbSJK1LiI/50002 THESE CRATERS ARE WEEPING DURING THE SUMMER
trainval/P1sbSJK1LiI/50003 BUT WHAT DID WE FIND
trainval/P1sbSJK1LiI/50004 GALILEO MISSION TOLD US THAT BUT WE NEVER SAW ANY PLUMES
trainval/P2dlq8ZqjDM/50001 RARELY IS SOMEONE EVER LABELED AS BEING JUST OKAY AT MATH OR A MEDIOCRE ATHLETE
trainval/P2dlq8ZqjDM/50002 FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE SEE AND LABEL THEMSELVES AS EITHER SHY OR OUTGOING SMART OR DUMB A
trainval/P2dlq8ZqjDM/50003 PEOPLE THINK ABOUT ISSUES AND ANSWERS IN BINARIES AS WELL
trainval/P2dlq8ZqjDM/50004 WHILE THIS BINARY WAY OF THINKING MAY BE USEFUL AND UNAVOIDABLE IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES IN OTHERS ESPECIALLY WHEN
trainval/P2dlq8ZqjDM/50005 WITH THIS WAY OF THINKING THERE'S NO SPECTRUM NO GRAY AREA AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THERE'S NO COMMON GROUND
trainval/P2dlq8ZqjDM/50006 THINK ABOUT THE LAST US ELECTION AND HOW PEOPLE WOULD ALIGN THEMSELVES WITH THE MOST OPPOSITE EXTREMES
trainval/P2dlq8ZqjDM/50007 WHAT HE FOUND WAS THAT THE LEGISLATORS THAT WERE MOST EFFECTIVE WERE THE ONES MOST WILLING TO FIND COMMON GROUND
trainval/P2dlq8ZqjDM/50008 THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ABLE TO DISREGARD THEIR IDENTITY AS A REPUBLICAN OR A DEMOCRAT AND FOCUSED ON THE ISSUES AND
trainval/P2dlq8ZqjDM/50009 WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MOVE BEYOND BINARY THINKING FOR OURSELVES AND FOR WORKING TOGETHER
trainval/P2dlq8ZqjDM/50010 SO WHAT ARE THE STEPS THAT WE CAN TAKE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS
trainval/P2dlq8ZqjDM/50011 I THINK THIS IS A HARD QUESTION
trainval/p2MEGk5q1WI/50001 IT WAS THE SUM OF ALL HUMAN KNOWLEDGE THAT WAS THE GOAL OF THIS ENCYCLOPEDIA BUT THERE'D BE A COMPANY THAT HELD THE COPYRIGHT BUT ALLOW ANYONE
trainval/p2MEGk5q1WI/50002 WOMEN SCIENTISTS THE GENDER GAP
trainval/p2MEGk5q1WI/50003 THEY RAISE MONEY EVERY YEAR TO PAY THE NEXT YEAR'S BILLS
trainval/p2MEGk5q1WI/50004 THAT'S THE MODEL THAT YOU HAVE
trainval/p2MEGk5q1WI/50005 ANY TIME ANY PLACE ANY WAY THAT YOU MEASURE IT IT'S BEEN BETWEEN 88 TO
trainval/p2MEGk5q1WI/50006 SO TO GET MORE WOMAN INVOLVED IS A HUGE PROBLEM FOR WIKIPEDIA
trainval/P2SxoBj3daM/50001 IF YOU ASK MOST PARENTS THEY SAY YES WE DID PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING
trainval/P2SxoBj3daM/50002 BUT THINGS GET EVEN MORE COMPLICATED
trainval/P2SxoBj3daM/50003 THAT STILL SOUNDS A LITTLE TECHNICAL I KNOW
trainval/P2SxoBj3daM/50004 I THINK ACTUALLY THAT'S VERY GOOD ADVICE
trainval/P2SxoBj3daM/50005 I WOULDN'T WANT TO CONTRADICT THAT
trainval/P2y3Uspr8Bg/50001 IT WAS AN INVISIBLE LIFE HEADING FOR A NAMELESS GRAVE
trainval/P2y3Uspr8Bg/50002 I CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THE PEOPLE SMUGGLERS TO HELP ME WITH THE CROSSING TO BRITAIN BUT I WILL GO BUY A WETSUIT AND I WILL SWIM
trainval/P3fIZuW9PSM/50001 AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF MY THIRD MARRIAGE IN 2005 I REALIZED THAT I'VE BEEN MARRYING EVERYONE IN
trainval/P3fIZuW9PSM/50002 IT'S A BIG IDEA
trainval/P3fIZuW9PSM/50003 WE STILL HAVE A WONDERFUL RELATIONSHIP
trainval/P3fIZuW9PSM/50004 HE IS A REALLY GOOD GUY
trainval/P3fIZuW9PSM/50005 BECAUSE WHEN YOU MARRY YOURSELF THIS HUGE THING HAPPENS
trainval/P3fIZuW9PSM/50006 YOU BECOME ABLE TO LOVE IN THIS WHOLE NEW WAY
trainval/P3fIZuW9PSM/50007 YOU BECOME ABLE TO LOVE OTHER PEOPLE RIGHT WHERE THEY ARE FOR WHO THEY ARE THE SAME WAY YOU'RE ALREADY
trainval/P3fIZuW9PSM/50008 THAT'S MY NEW JOB
trainval/P3fIZuW9PSM/50009 YOU KNOW THE ANSWER IS I AM STILL WORKING ON IT
trainval/P3fIZuW9PSM/50010 AS I REFLECTED ON THE DATE AFTERWARDS I WAS LIKE WOW I GOT REALLY EXCITED
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50001 BECAUSE THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I NEEDED YOU TO TURN MY TELESCOPE TO THE WRONG SIGHT TO MAKE EVERYTHING
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50002 MY WAY OF TELLING MY STORY HAS BEEN WRITING FOR PRETTY MUCH AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER BUT MOST RECENTLY WRITING SPOKEN WORD
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50003 THIS IS AN INVITATION TO STOP RIPPING YOURSELF APART
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50004 IT FEELS LIKE I'M TAKING ALL OF THIS CONFUSION AND EMOTION AND ALL THOSE OTHER KINDS OF ART BUILDING UP INSIDE OF ME
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50005 I DO STOP RIPPING MYSELF APART AS A RESULT BECAUSE I SEE SO PLAINLY RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME THAT MY STORY SHOULD BE
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50006 BUT I ALSO LOVE THIS QUOTE BECAUSE IT IMPLIES SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50007 IT IMPLIES THAT WE ALREADY HAVE ART IN OUR MOUTHS ALL OF US
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50008 IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH SOME PROCESS TO GET IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT ONLY ARTISTS HAVE
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50009 WE HAVE IT BECAUSE WE'RE HUMANS
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50010 THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I FOUND OUT PRETTY ACCIDENTALLY
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50011 THIS TED TALK WAS BY AN INCREDIBLE POET AND JUST AMAZING HUMAN BEING NAMED SARAH KAY
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50012 BECAUSE I HAD WRITTEN FOR A WHILE BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT OF IT AS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE REALLY INTERNAL
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50013 I WOULD HIDE BEHIND A LOT OF ABSTRACTIONS AND KIND OF BEAT AROUND THE BUSH
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50014 SARAH WASN'T DOING ANY OF THAT
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50015 SHE WAS REALLY VULNERABLE BUT SO BRAVE AT THE SAME TIME
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50016 I WAS OBSESSED INSTANTLY
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50017 FAST FORWARD ABOUT FOUR MONTHS LATER I WENT TO GO SEE SARAH KAY PERFORM IN PERSON
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50018 BEFORE SHE WENT ON THERE WAS WHAT I THOUGHT WAS AN OPEN MIC NIGHT GOING ON
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50019 SOME OF MY FRIENDS MADE ME SIGN UP AND I'M LIKE OK I'LL DO IT
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50020 IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS WAS THE QUALIFYING ROUND TO GET ONTO THE SAY WORD POMONA SLAM TEAM
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50021 I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU HAD TO MEMORIZE POEMS I DIDN'T KNOW SOME OF THESE SLAM FORMALITIES WHERE YOU SNAP AND POEMS ARE PRETTY
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50022 BUT I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE TIME TO FREAK OUT SO THEY CALL MY NAME I GET UP TO THE STAGE SHAKING I'M READING OUT OF MY
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50023 THIS WAS REALLY CRAZY POINT OF MY LIFE WHERE I WAS FINALLY REALLY PAST THAT EATING DISORDER
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50024 I WAS READY TO TALK ABOUT IT
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50025 I WAS COMING TO TERMS WITH MY SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND NOT SEEING IT AS SOMETHING SHAMEFUL ANYMORE
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50026 IT WAS THIS TIME IN MY LIFE WHERE I JUST STARTED TO LIKE MYSELF
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50027 I KNEW I WANTED TO TELL MY STORY AND I KNEW THAT I WANTED TO HELP PEOPLE IN THE PROCESS I JUST HAD NO IDEA HOW THAT
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50028 UNTIL THIS MOMENT
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50029 PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE WERE SNAPPING AND RESPONDING AND I KNEW THAT I WAS IN THIS MOMENT OF REALLY INCREDIBLE
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50030 I'VE BEEN SO ADDICTED TO THAT FEELING EVER SINCE
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50031 YOU TAUGHT ME HOW TO TURN EVERY EYE CONTACT INTO SILENT WHISPERS SILENT FINGER
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50032 HONESTY INSPIRES OTHER HONESTY AND IF YOU CAN FIND WAYS TO FUSE THESE TOGETHER THERE'S SO MUCH
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50033 THERE WOULD BE LINES IN THERE WHERE I WOULD JUST THINK YES I FELT THAT AND THOUGHT THAT SO MANY TIMES AND JUST NEVER KNEW HOW TO
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50034 BUT THEN CONVERSELY SOMEONE WOULD DO A POEM WITH EXPERIENCES AND OPINIONS THAT WERE COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM MY OWN
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50035 THERE'S A LOT OF AMAZING THINGS ABOUT TEENAGE GIRL CULTURE BUT THERE'S A LOT OF REALLY TOXIC THINGS
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50036 THIS ISN'T FOR NO REASON
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50037 WE SEE THESE THINGS ALL THE TIME
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50038 IF SHE'S REALLY ATTRACTIVE GREAT BUT THAT'S ALL WE KNOW ABOUT HER
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50039 IF SHE'S DEALING WITH SOMETHING LIKE A MENTAL ILLNESS THAT MENTAL ILLNESS IS ALMOST ALWAYS EITHER TRIVIALIZED OR REALLY
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50040 SO WE FEEL EVEN MORE ISOLATED
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50041 HOW ARE WE GOING TO WANT TO TELL OUR STORIES IF WE FEEL LIKE OUR STORIES ARE WRONG AND WEIRD
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50042 THEN THERE'S AN EQUAL AND OPPOSITE PRESSURE ON TEENAGE BOYS TO WITHHOLD THEIR STORIES AND THERE ARE JUST THESE GAPING HOLES
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50043 MY WAY OF DOING THAT TODAY IS GOING TO BE SHARING WHAT I'LL CALL MY STEPS FOR SPITTING OUT THE ART IN MY MOUTH
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50044 THAT IS VALIDATE MYSELF AND THAT SOUNDS HUGE
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50045 BUT IT'S REALLY AS SIMPLE AS JUST REMINDING MYSELF THAT IF I DON'T TELL MY STORY NO ONE IS GOING TO
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50046 THAT ALONE IS REASON ENOUGH TO TELL IT
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50047 SECOND STEP IS HARD BECAUSE I TEND TO BE PERFECTIONIST
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50048 I THINK IT IS
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50049 THAT IS GIVING MYSELF PERMISSION TO EXPERIMENT AND TRY THINGS OUT AND LET MY STORY BE HOW
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50050 BUT WE DO NEED TO GIVE OURSELVES THIS FREEDOM BECAUSE MAYBE THE BEST WAY OF TELLING YOUR STORY IS THROUGH A FICTIONAL VOICE
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50051 MAYBE IT'S VISUALLY YOU DON'T KNOW UNTIL YOU TRY AND THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH TALENT AND EVERYTHING TO DO WITH CHECKING
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50052 THE THIRD STEP IS WHAT TAKES US FROM BEING IN AN INTERNAL PROCESS TO SOMETHING THAT HELPS OTHERS
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50053 SOMETIMES THAT'S GOING TO AN OPEN MIC NIGHT SOMETIMES THAT'S JUST POSTING A POEM ON TUMBLR
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50054 IT'S ALWAYS SCARY THIS DOESN'T GET EASIER BUT IT'S SO IMPORTANT
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50055 MY MOTIVATION FOR DOING THAT IS THINKING THAT IF I CAN DO THIS THE FOURTH STEP WILL HAPPEN NATURALLY
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50056 NOT ONLY FOR OUR MENTAL HEALTH BUT ALSO FOR THE HEALTH OF THE SOCIETY THAT WE'RE ALL IN
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50057 THAT FOURTH STEP IS INSPIRING OTHERS TO HAVE THE SAME PROCESS
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50058 I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT IF JUST ONE OF YOU GOES HOME TODAY AND DECIDES TO SPIT OUT AND SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF ART
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50059 THERE ARE SO MANY INDIVIDUAL GROUPS THAT COULD REALLY BENEFIT FROM THIS BUT ONE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT I HAVE SOME INSIGHT INTO
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50060 BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALWAYS HAD A HOME INSIDE THE FOUR WALLS OF YOUR OWN SKIN BUT GIRL I
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50061 BUT THEN IF WE IGNORE THAT AND DO IT ANYWAY WE'RE NOT REALLY TAKEN SERIOUSLY AFTERWARDS
trainval/p49rv25dx0g/50062 SO WE END UP HAVING TO HAVE THESE REALLY CRAFTED IDENTITIES
trainval/P4pKrxVcvJc/50001 WELL ACCORDING TO MULTIPLE STUDIES BY THE U
trainval/P4pKrxVcvJc/50002 BUT BEFORE I DO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE NO ONE IS CONFUSED I AM HERE TO TALK ABOUT BALLOTS
trainval/P4pKrxVcvJc/50003 IT'S SOMETHING WE ROLLED OUT IN THE ELECTION'S OFFICE HERE IN ADA COUNTY IN IDAHO AS PART OF EARLY VOTING
trainval/P4pKrxVcvJc/50004 BY GOING MOBILE WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE VOTING MORE AVAILABLE TO MORE PEOPLE IN
trainval/P4pKrxVcvJc/50005 THE KEY TO FOOT TRUCK VOTING IS THE SIMPLICITY OF THE DESIGN
trainval/P4pKrxVcvJc/50006 WE'RE NOT THE FIRST ONES TO COME UP WITH A MOBILE POLLING PLACE
trainval/P4pKrxVcvJc/50007 BUT WHAT WE'VE DONE IS SIMPLIFY THE DESIGN IN A WAY THAT MAKES IT AFFORDABLE TO IMPLEMENT
trainval/P4pKrxVcvJc/50008 HERE WE ARE IN DOWNTOWN BOISE
trainval/P4pKrxVcvJc/50009 IT WAS IN THAT MOMENT THAT WE REALIZED WE NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND IN AN EMERGENCY
trainval/P4pKrxVcvJc/50010 HENCE A MOBILE POLLING PLACE
trainval/P4pKrxVcvJc/50011 SO FROM THERE OUR EMERGENCY BACKUP PLAN EVOLVED INTO FOOD TRUCK VOTING
trainval/P4pKrxVcvJc/50012 THIS ALLOW US TO SECURELY PRINT EACH VOTER'S BALLOT AND ENSURE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT CONTENTS
trainval/P4pKrxVcvJc/50013 SO IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE IN THE COUNTY WE ARE OR WHERE IN THE COUNTY THE VOTER IS FROM WE CAN
trainval/P4pKrxVcvJc/50014 ONCE THE VOTER HAS THEIR BALLOT VOTING IS SIMPLE
trainval/P4pKrxVcvJc/50015 THAT MEANS WE CAN PULL UP TO AN EMPTY PARKING LOT OR PULL UP TO A STREET CORNER AND IN 20
trainval/P4pKrxVcvJc/50016 IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU ARE IN AN URBAN OR RURAL ENVIRONMENT FOOD TRUCK VOTING CAN
trainval/P4pKrxVcvJc/50017 BUT THAT WAS JUST DAYS AFTER WE'D SET UP ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD IN A SMALL RURAL TOWN AND CAUGHT
trainval/P4pKrxVcvJc/50018 WE SHOULDN'T LET OUR BUSY LIVES OR INCONVENIENCE STAND IN OUR WAY
trainval/P4pKrxVcvJc/50019 INSTEAD OF HAVING A RAMP OR A WHEELCHAIR LIFT BY KEEPING VOTING OUT ON THE SIDEWALK UNDERNEATH THE
trainval/p4tffKWs3BM/50001 ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS ARE RUNNING ABOUT LIVING THEIR OWN LIVES DOING THEIR OWN THINGS AND YOU CAN'T INTERACT WITH THEM YOU'RE TRAPPED
trainval/p4tffKWs3BM/50002 EVERYTHING'S MOVING SO FAST AND YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT
trainval/p4tffKWs3BM/50003 I SHARE THIS STORY WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH CFS
trainval/p4tffKWs3BM/50004 I GOT ILL ONE DAY
trainval/p4tffKWs3BM/50005 THAT'S NOT AN EXAGGERATION
trainval/p4tffKWs3BM/50006 I WAS LITERALLY TOO TIRED TO DO ANYTHING ELSE
trainval/p4tffKWs3BM/50007 MY ROUTINE WAS LITERALLY WAKE UP AT 1 P
trainval/p4tffKWs3BM/50008 I'M MASSIVELY OVERSIMPLIFYING HERE BUT THE WAY A GOOD DOCTOR WOULD DIAGNOSE
trainval/p4tffKWs3BM/50011 I HAVE KNOWN PEOPLE GO MONTHS OR YEARS WITHOUT A DIAGNOSIS
trainval/p4tffKWs3BM/50012 HOW DO YOU GET BETTER
trainval/p4tffKWs3BM/50013 THOSE THREE THINGS ARE LIKE I SAID IT'S ALL IN YOUR MIND GET OVER IT YOGA AND
trainval/p4tffKWs3BM/50014 THEY DON'T WORK
trainval/p4tffKWs3BM/50015 I'M OBSESSED WITH CLOUDS
trainval/p4tffKWs3BM/50016 SERIOUSLY CLOUDS ARE BEAUTIFUL
trainval/p4tffKWs3BM/50017 YOU ALL NEED TO APPRECIATE THEM MORE
trainval/p4tffKWs3BM/50018 THE NEXT POSITIVE I FOUND IS I'VE REALIZED JUST HOW LUCKY I AM
trainval/p4tffKWs3BM/50019 THAT'S HUGE THAT'S AMAZING
trainval/p4tffKWs3BM/50020 EVEN THIS SCHOOL YOU KNOW
trainval/p4tffKWs3BM/50022 BUT THIS SCHOOL'S DONE A LOT FOR ME
trainval/p4tffKWs3BM/50023 IS THERE MORE THEY COULD HAVE DONE
trainval/p4tffKWs3BM/50024 BUT HAVE THEY DONE A LOT ANYWAY
trainval/p4tffKWs3BM/50025 OF COURSE THEY HAVE AND I'M AMAZINGLY APPRECIATIVE OF THAT ABSOLUTELY
trainval/P4X9ZfEx9So/50001 HERE'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE
trainval/P4X9ZfEx9So/50002 THIS STUFF IS HAPPENING NOW
trainval/P4X9ZfEx9So/50003 LET GO OF THE STEREOTYPES LET GO OF THE FANTASY AND TOGETHER WE CAN HAVE SOME INTELLIGENT CONVERSATIONS
trainval/P5Mpo4JQZhw/50001 ABORTION IS COMMON
trainval/P5Mpo4JQZhw/50002 AN ARE YOU WITH US OR AGAINST US
trainval/P5Mpo4JQZhw/50003 THAT SOUNDS PRETTY NICE
trainval/P5Mpo4JQZhw/50004 ONE IS TO ASK OPEN ENDED QUESTIONS
trainval/P5Mpo4JQZhw/50005 WHAT WAS THAT LIKE
trainval/P5Mpo4JQZhw/50006 IF SOMEONE DESCRIBES THEMSELVES AS GENDER QUEER TO YOU YOU CAN SAY GENDER QUEER
trainval/P5Mpo4JQZhw/50007 NOW SOME OF OUR VOLUNTEERS ARE RELIGIOUS BUT THIS PARTICULAR ONE WAS NOT
trainval/P5Mpo4JQZhw/50008 SO SHE DECIDED TO GET COMFORTABLE
trainval/P5Mpo4JQZhw/50009 HOW WOULD I KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT DECISION WAS
trainval/P65XdTlk4vA/50001 THEY HAD NONE OF THAT
trainval/P65XdTlk4vA/50002 AND YET MYSTERIOUSLY SOMEHOW THE BEE FLIES
trainval/P65XdTlk4vA/50003 NO ONE PAYS YOU TO DO THIS
trainval/P65XdTlk4vA/50004 IT TURNS OUT THERE IS NO ONE OVERALL MAP OF THE INTERNET
trainval/P65XdTlk4vA/50005 SO WHAT DO WE DO TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS WHERE
trainval/P65XdTlk4vA/50006 WE TURN TO THE PERSON ON THE RIGHT AND WE TELL THAT PERSON WHAT WE SEE ON OUR LEFT AND VICE
trainval/P65XdTlk4vA/50007 THE BAD NEWS IS THERE IS NO FIRE BRIGADE
trainval/P65XdTlk4vA/50008 THE PERSON SAID NO THAT'S FINE
trainval/P65XdTlk4vA/50009 AND IT TURNS OUT THIS MODEL IS EVERYWHERE ONCE YOU START LOOKING FOR IT
trainval/P65XdTlk4vA/50010 AND SOME OF THEM ARE MID LEVEL EMPLOYEES AT INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS AROUND THE WORLD
trainval/P65XdTlk4vA/50011 JIMBO'S IDEA WAS FOR NUPEDIA
trainval/P65XdTlk4vA/50012 AND HERE IS THE MESSAGE WHERE ONE OF THEM SAYS LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT A LIVE ONE
trainval/P65XdTlk4vA/50013 WE HAVE A HIJACKING OF YOUTUBE
trainval/P65XdTlk4vA/50014 THIS IS NOT A DRILL
trainval/P65XdTlk4vA/50015 IT'S NOT JUST THE CLUELESSNESS OF YOUTUBE ENGINEERS
trainval/P65XdTlk4vA/50016 TOTALLY MORTIFYING TO HIM
trainval/P65XdTlk4vA/50017 SOMETHING IS UP IN PAKISTAN
trainval/P65XdTlk4vA/50018 IT'S NOT A NOUN
trainval/P6w7Eq7YhL8/50001 AND IT HAS A TWO FOLD MEANING
trainval/P6w7Eq7YhL8/50002 AND THESE PEOPLE THAT I WAS WORKING WITH WAS VARIOUSLY CONSUMED WITH TWO TERMS
trainval/P6w7Eq7YhL8/50003 WHAT THEY WANTED TO CREATE IN THE WORLD
trainval/P6w7Eq7YhL8/50004 SECOND TO EMBODY
trainval/P6w7Eq7YhL8/50006 THEY ACCEPT THAT IT ACTUALLY PROBABLY ISN'T AND DO IT ANYWAY
trainval/P6w7Eq7YhL8/50007 A NUMBER OF MY CLIENTS COME TO ME AND THEY'RE LOOKING EXTERNALLY FOR A VISION
trainval/P6w7Eq7YhL8/50008 THEY WANT TO I'M SURE LIKE MANY OF YOU HELP THE WORLD DO SOMETHING TO HELP PEOPLE
trainval/p7YRnLbmLGs/50001 LET'S TAKE MATH FOR EXAMPLE A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE MATH EVEN THOUGH SOME LOVE IT
trainval/p7YRnLbmLGs/50002 I WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE
trainval/p7YRnLbmLGs/50003 BUT NOW THAT I'VE BEEN INTRODUCED TO PROJECT BASED LEARNING I FOUND MATH A LOT OF FUN
trainval/p7YRnLbmLGs/50004 AND BECAUSE OF ALL THESE INTERACTIVE LESSONS I'VE ALMOST COME TO LOVE MATH
trainval/p7YRnLbmLGs/50005 ALL RIGHT MOVING ON TO THE NEXT ONE
trainval/p7YRnLbmLGs/50006 FOR A MOMENT I WANT YOU AS THE AUDIENCE TO THINK ON WHAT THIS OTHER TOPIC COULD BE
trainval/p7YRnLbmLGs/50007 I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE A FEW SECONDS TO THINK ABOUT
trainval/p7YRnLbmLGs/50008 THAT'S RIGHT TEAMWORK
trainval/p7YRnLbmLGs/50009 TEAMWORK IS A VERY IMPORTANT ELEMENT TO PROJECT BASED LEARNING
trainval/p7YRnLbmLGs/50010 BUT SOME OF YOU AT THIS TIME SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE THINKING WELL WHAT'S THE POINT OF ALL THIS
trainval/p7YRnLbmLGs/50011 WHEN WE GET OLDER WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FACE THE STRUGGLE THAT IS WORKING WITH OTHERS
trainval/p7YRnLbmLGs/50012 ADULTS HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS THEY HAVE TO COLLABORATE AND THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX
trainval/p7YRnLbmLGs/50013 THERE'S YOUR PROOF THAT PROJECT BASED LEARNING CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IF WE JUST MAKE THIS ONE
trainval/p7YRnLbmLGs/50014 WHAT FUN IS THAT
trainval/P82edb1SCNs/50001 WHY DO I INSIST
trainval/P82edb1SCNs/50002 FIRST I ASK IF YOU REALLY NEED THAT BECAUSE MANY NEEDS ARE CREATED
trainval/P86fZa4xKSw/50001 HE SAYS YEAH THIS CAR IT JUST ACCELERATES LIKE HELL
trainval/P86fZa4xKSw/50002 AND I CAN DOWNLOAD APPS ON IT
trainval/P86fZa4xKSw/50003 AND I CAN SURF THE WEB
trainval/P86fZa4xKSw/50004 IT'S NOT JUST AN ELECTRIC CAR
trainval/P86fZa4xKSw/50005 IT DOESN'T DRIVE ELECTRIC
trainval/P86fZa4xKSw/50006 IT'S MORE THAN THAT
trainval/P86fZa4xKSw/50007 AND I SAY WELL YEAH BUT IT'S HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED
trainval/P86fZa4xKSw/50008 AND THAT WILL NEVER GROW
trainval/P86fZa4xKSw/50010 WELL THAT'S GONNA CHANGE
trainval/P86fZa4xKSw/50011 AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT TODAY
trainval/P86fZa4xKSw/50012 THAT'S WHY YOU WANT IT
trainval/P86fZa4xKSw/50013 IT'S BECOMING AN ELECTRIC APPLIANCE
trainval/P86fZa4xKSw/50014 YEAR ON YEAR THESE PRODUCTS GET BETTER AND BETTER AND BETTER
trainval/P86fZa4xKSw/50015 THAT'S HIGHLY DISRUPTIVE
trainval/P86fZa4xKSw/50016 THEY WILL CHARGE FASTER
trainval/P86fZa4xKSw/50017 THAT'S WHAT I CALL DISRUPTION
trainval/P86fZa4xKSw/50018 IN 1 OR 2 YEARS YOU GOT A SERIOUS MARKET SHARE
trainval/P8GCjrDWWUM/50001 IF YOU'RE A FELLOW ROTARIAN NICE TO MEET YOU
trainval/P8GCjrDWWUM/50002 WE WENT TO INDIA TO GIVE A TALK AND OUR PARENTS TOOK US TO VISIT THE FORMER PRIVATE HOUSE OF MAHATMA GANDHI
trainval/P8GCjrDWWUM/50003 ALL WE WANTED TO DO WAS STOP THOSE PLASTIC BAGS FROM WRAPPING AND SUFFOCATING OUR BEAUTIFUL HOME
trainval/P8GCjrDWWUM/50004 HE SIGNED A PROMISE TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF BALI SAY NO TO PLASTIC BAGS
trainval/P8GCjrDWWUM/50005 AND WE ARE NOW FRIENDS AND ON A REGULAR BASIS WE REMIND HIM AND HIS TEAM OF THE PROMISES HE HAS MADE
trainval/p8qbV95vwO8/50001 WE APPRECIATE THEM EXACTLY FOR THE SAME QUALITIES THAT MAKE THEM
trainval/P9B8PmUR64U/50001 NOW UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES ARE FANTASTIC FOR SPOTTING DESIRE PATHS
trainval/P9B8PmUR64U/50002 I THINK IT'S BECAUSE STUDENTS ARE ALWAYS LATE AND THEY'RE PRETTY SMART
trainval/P9B8PmUR64U/50003 SO THEY'RE DASHING TO LECTURES
trainval/P9B8PmUR64U/50004 THEY'LL ALWAYS FIND THE SHORTCUT
trainval/P9B8PmUR64U/50005 THE ANSWER IS RARELY INSIDE THE BUILDING
trainval/P9B8PmUR64U/50006 OUR JOB IS TO PICK THE APPROPRIATE ONES AND PAVE OVER THEM
trainval/p9HPUiEdEj0/50001 FOR ME THAT INVOLVED LETTING GO OF A LOT OF THE CONSTRUCTS I HAD IN MY HEAD ABOUT WHAT IMPACT WAS AND WHERE I WOULD
trainval/p9UC0chfXcg/50001 AND I'LL SHOW YOU ALSO THAT THAT LEADS TO MANY INSIGHTS IN TERMS OF OUR OWN HEALTH
trainval/p9UC0chfXcg/50002 BUT I WANT TO BE MORE SPECIFIC
trainval/p9UC0chfXcg/50003 I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
trainval/p9UC0chfXcg/50004 SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THIS WERE A MUSCLE CELL THE PROTEINS WOULD BE IN ONE
trainval/p9UC0chfXcg/50005 WELL YEAH I THINK SO
trainval/p9UC0chfXcg/50006 LIGHT MATTERS FOR FUNCTION AND THEREFORE FOR HEALTH AND WATER MATTERS FOR
trainval/p9UC0chfXcg/50007 THERE ARE SOME SUBSTANCES THAT ARE KNOWN THROUGH THE MILLENIA TO BE GOOD FOR HEALTH AND
trainval/p9UC0chfXcg/50008 AND WHY DO YOU FEEL GOOD
trainval/p9UC0chfXcg/50009 WELL IT MIGHT BE SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUE BUT YOU'RE CONNECTING YOURSELF TO THE EARTH AND THE
trainval/p9UC0chfXcg/50010 SO WE UNDERGO NOT JUST PLANTS WE UNDERGO THE FIRST STEP IN
trainval/P9YbrVFoX0Q/50001 AND I THINK WHAT IT REALLY BOILS DOWN TO IS MAPS
trainval/P9YbrVFoX0Q/50002 THIS IS OBVIOUSLY VERY HELPFUL FOR UNDERSTANDING THE GEOGRAPHY OF A PLACE LIKE ISTANBUL OR FIGURING OUT HOW TO GET FROM
trainval/P9YbrVFoX0Q/50003 THIS IS SAN FRANCISCO
trainval/P9YbrVFoX0Q/50004 YOU CAN SEE SOME OTHER PATTERNS EMERGED HERE
trainval/P9YbrVFoX0Q/50005 EVERYBODY IS SORT OF INTERESTED IN SPORTS
trainval/P9YbrVFoX0Q/50006 AND SOME PEOPLE ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN SPORTS
trainval/P9YbrVFoX0Q/50007 BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY CLUSTER TOGETHER
trainval/P9YbrVFoX0Q/50008 SO THINGS LIKE BEES AND STUFF LIKE THAT
trainval/P9YbrVFoX0Q/50009 OH YEAH I AGREE
trainval/paiRIkWVy0o/50001 BUT BEFORE I COULD LAND ON THE DESIRED WORD I FELT A FIRM TAP ON MY SHOULDER AND A STERN GAZE
trainval/paiRIkWVy0o/50002 WE SEE IT IN ADVERTISEMENTS
trainval/paiRIkWVy0o/50003 I ALSO ASKED HETEROSEXUAL MEN TO IMAGINE A WOMAN THAT THEY'RE PARTNERED WITH IS PREGNANT AND THEN ASKED WOMEN TO
trainval/paiRIkWVy0o/50004 THEY EXPERIENCE LESS SEXISM
trainval/paiRIkWVy0o/50005 IN MY EFFORTS TO EXPLAIN THIS TO OTHERS ONE CONVERSATION LED TO THE VENUS OF WILLENDORF
trainval/paiRIkWVy0o/50006 THEY ALSO ASSUMED THAT SHE WAS MEANT TO BE HELD OR PLACED LYING DOWN BECAUSE HER TINY FEET DON'T ALLOW HER TO
trainval/paiRIkWVy0o/50007 I'VE TAKEN TO CALLING THIS THE WILLENDORF EFFECT AND ONCE AGAIN WE SEE IT REINFORCED IN MANY ASPECTS OF HER
trainval/pASKEZ1bSLg/50001 THANK YOU ALL
trainval/pASKEZ1bSLg/50002 I REMEMBER IT BEING KIND OF SCARY WHEN I FIRST CAME TO PRISON
trainval/paSYuxyRDuw/50001 AND THE QUESTION IS WHO DO YOU WANT TO REMEMBER IF YOU HAD JUST 45 MINUTES WITH YOUR GRANDMOTHER
trainval/paSYuxyRDuw/50002 I'M GOING TO PLAY YOU JUST A COUPLE OF QUICK EXCERPTS FROM THE PROJECT
trainval/paSYuxyRDuw/50004 WE WANT PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE PEOPLE WHO HAVE OWNERSHIP
trainval/paSYuxyRDuw/50005 SO THE MEMORIAL OPENED IN 2011 AND THE MUSEUM'S GOING TO OPEN NEXT YEAR IN 2014
trainval/paSYuxyRDuw/50006 IT'S ESSENTIALLY A WAY TO MAKE A NATIONAL ORAL HISTORIES ARCHIVE ONE CONVERSATION AT A TIME
trainval/paSYuxyRDuw/50007 AND WALD'S WIDOW REQUESTED THAT THEY BE LISTED NEXT TO EACH OTHER
trainval/PB2OegI6wvI/50001 IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OVER
trainval/PB2OegI6wvI/50002 WELL TITUS WAS CONSUMED WITH HIS CIVIL CASE
trainval/PB2OegI6wvI/50003 I'VE STUDIED MEMORY FOR DECADES
trainval/PB2OegI6wvI/50004 WHAT DO YOU DO
trainval/PB2OegI6wvI/50005 WOULD THE SAME KIND OF MISTAKES BE MADE WITH A REALLY STRESSFUL EVENT
trainval/PB2OegI6wvI/50006 THERE SHE GOES
trainval/PB7xs7UpIfY/50001 IT CAN HAPPEN IN DIFFERENT WAYS OF COURSE AND USUALLY COMES IN STAGES
trainval/PB7xs7UpIfY/50002 AND IF YOU REACH BACK INTO THE DARK CORNERS OF YOUR MEMORY YOU MIGHT REMEMBER SOMETHING LIKE
trainval/PB7xs7UpIfY/50003 THEY WERE THEN ASKED AGAIN ABOUT THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS
trainval/PB7xs7UpIfY/50004 IT'S JUST THIS
trainval/PB7xs7UpIfY/50005 SO 100 YEARS AGO HORMONES HAD JUST BEEN DISCOVERED AND PEOPLE HOPED THAT HORMONE TREATMENTS WERE GOING TO
trainval/PB7xs7UpIfY/50006 AND THE IDEA THAT WE CAN ALL BE RESURRECTED TO LIVE AGAIN IS ORTHODOX BELIEVE NOT JUST FOR CHRISTIANS BUT ALSO
trainval/PB7xs7UpIfY/50007 YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A GREAT WARRIOR LIKE ACHILLES OR A GREAT KING OR HERO
trainval/PB7xs7UpIfY/50008 AND SO IT SHOULD BE WITH US
trainval/pbGLBjDhnSY/50001 AND THE MORE THE MORE THAT WE HAVE THOSE INTERACTIONS THE MORE IT DEVELOPS A KIND OF OF A VALUE OR AN EXPECTATION OF BEHAVIOR
trainval/pbGLBjDhnSY/50002 AND I THINK PARKOUR DIRECTLY KIND OF CHALLENGES THAT
trainval/pbGLBjDhnSY/50003 WE SORT OF MAKE THE RULES ON WHAT THESE THINGS MEAN
trainval/pbGLBjDhnSY/50004 AND AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO KIND OF CHALLENGE THAT
trainval/pbotabqHUys/50001 I STOOD MY GROUND
trainval/pbotabqHUys/50002 I WAS VERY HESITANT TO ASK FOR MORE MONEY ESPECIALLY SINCE MY INDUSTRY PARTNER HAD ALREADY BEEN
trainval/pbotabqHUys/50003 SO THE NEXT STEP WAS OF COURSE THE LAB
trainval/pbotabqHUys/50004 NOW FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT AREN'T BIOCHEMISTS OUR GOAL WAS ACTUALLY QUITE SIMPLE OR SIMPLE
trainval/pbotabqHUys/50005 SO IF OUR PLANT IS ALSO SHOWN TO HAVE AN
trainval/pbSSrJGgVIo/50001 DID YOU NOTICE OTHER PEOPLE NOT FINDING THE APP THAT DAY
trainval/pbSSrJGgVIo/50002 YOU'RE BEING FORCED TO BE WHETHER YOU WANT IT OR NOT A KIND OF GLOBAL VISIONARY WHO'S CHANGING THE WORLD
trainval/pbSSrJGgVIo/50003 BUT WE DON'T WANT JUST ANY MATH PROBLEM WE WANT THE HARDEST ONES THAT WE CAN POSSIBLY FIND AND WE WANT THE ONE THAT IF YOU SOLVE IT
trainval/pbSSrJGgVIo/50004 THAT'S PART ONE
trainval/pbSSrJGgVIo/50005 SAME MONTH EVERY YEAR
trainval/pCd8KLukRV8/50001 AFTER ALL I WANT TO GET SOMEWHERE
trainval/pCd8KLukRV8/50002 IT'S THE IDEA THAT I GET ALL THE BENEFIT OF THE BICYLE WITHOUT ANY OF THE HASSLE OF THE OWNERSHIP BEHIND IT
trainval/pCd8KLukRV8/50003 SO WHY FARGO AND WHY NOW
trainval/pCd8KLukRV8/50004 WELL THIS IDEA IS TAKING OFF IN OUR PEER CITIES LIKE WASHINTON D
trainval/pCd8KLukRV8/50005 ATLANTA BOSTON MINNEAPOLIS PLACES LIKE THAT WHERE THIS IDEA SUCCEEDS BECAUSE IT BRINGS PEOPLE
trainval/pCd8KLukRV8/50006 I WANTED THE STORY INSIDE THE BOOK
trainval/pCd8KLukRV8/50007 THE IDEA BEHIND THE LIBRARY IS SOMETHING CALLED COLLABORATIVE CONSUMPTION
trainval/pCd8KLukRV8/50008 IT'S THE IDEA THAT I DON'T NECESSARILY WANT A HAND DRILL
trainval/pCd8KLukRV8/50009 I WANT A HOLE IN THE WALL
trainval/pCd8KLukRV8/50010 SO MY THOUGHT IS WHY DON'T WE TAKE THIS IDEA AND EXTEND IT TO TRANSPORTATION
trainval/PcDftBVDSlc/50001 WELL FROM THAT DISCUSSION GREW THIS PROGRAM THAT INVOLVED 2700 SCIENTISTS FROM MORE THAN 80 COUNTRIES AROUND THE
trainval/PcDftBVDSlc/50002 SO WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING IS SOMETHING CALLED SHIFTING BASELINES
trainval/PcDftBVDSlc/50003 AND SO WHAT THEY FOUND IN FACT IS THAT EXPLOITATION REALLY BEGAN HEAVILY WITH THE ROMANS
trainval/PcDftBVDSlc/50004 AND SO AT THAT TIME OF COURSE THERE WAS NO REFRIGERATION
trainval/PcDftBVDSlc/50005 SO FISHERMEN COULD ONLY CATCH WHAT THEY COULD EITHER EAT OR SELL THAT DAY
trainval/PcDftBVDSlc/50006 BUT THE ROMANS DEVELOPED SALTING
trainval/PcDftBVDSlc/50007 AND WITH SALTING IT BECAME POSSIBLE TO STORE FISH AND TO TRANSPORT IT LONG DISTANCES
trainval/PcDftBVDSlc/50008 BUT THROUGH A SATELLITE LINK I WAS ABLE TO SIT AT MY STUDY AT HOME WITH MY DOG CURLED UP AT MY FEET A CUP OF TEA IN MY HAND
trainval/PcDftBVDSlc/50009 AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE PILOT DID FOR ME
trainval/PcDftBVDSlc/50010 THAT'S THE SORT OF TECHNOLOGY THAT'S AVAILABLE TODAY THAT REALLY WASN'T AVAILABLE EVEN A DECADE AGO
trainval/PcDftBVDSlc/50011 THAT ALSO DOESN'T EVEN GET INTO THE WHOLE PROTEIN EXTRACTION THAT WE DO FROM THE OCEAN
trainval/PcDftBVDSlc/50012 AND THEN AT SOME PERIOD OF TIME IT POPS UP TO THE SURFACE AND AGAIN RELAYS THAT DATA BACK TO SHORE
trainval/PcDftBVDSlc/50013 BECAUSE GPS DOESN'T WORK UNDER WATER
trainval/PcDftBVDSlc/50014 BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE THE BIOMASS THAT REPRESENTS
trainval/PcDftBVDSlc/50015 BUT THE REALLY INTRIGUING THING ABOUT THE MICROBES IS JUST HOW DIVERSE THEY ARE
trainval/PcDftBVDSlc/50016 MARINE ORGANISMS DO NOT CARE ABOUT INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARIES THEY MOVE WHERE THEY WILL
trainval/pCHWOt3FOgY/50001 I COULD DO THE FORMULAS
trainval/pCHWOt3FOgY/50002 BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS BORING
trainval/pCHWOt3FOgY/50003 I THOUGHT IT WAS COLD
trainval/pCHWOt3FOgY/50004 I THOUGHT IT WAS DETACHED FROM LIFE
trainval/pCHWOt3FOgY/50005 I UNDERSTOOD MATHEMATICS IS ABOUT LIFE IT'S ABOUT NATURE IT IS
trainval/pCHWOt3FOgY/50006 IT'S ABOUT REPRESENTING
trainval/pCHWOt3FOgY/50007 I REALLY WANTED TO COMMUNICATE THAT OUT TO THE WORLD
trainval/pCHWOt3FOgY/50008 WHAT WE DO IN OUR CULTURE AND WHAT WE SAY ABOUT MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE IT REALLY MATTERS
trainval/pCHWOt3FOgY/50009 WHY DO THEY MOVE LIKE THEY MOVE
trainval/pCHWOt3FOgY/50010 WE CAN THEN GO TO THE COMPUTER AND SIMULATE THIS BEHAVIOR
trainval/pCHWOt3FOgY/50011 IT'S REPRESENTING THESE THINGS IN NUMBERS SO THEY GO BACK TO THE WORLD WITH NEW INSIGHT
trainval/pCHWOt3FOgY/50012 WE SIMPLY DON'T KNOW
trainval/pCHWOt3FOgY/50013 LET'S PLAY MORE GAMES
trainval/pCHWOt3FOgY/50014 WE HAVE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES THAT IS SO EASY
trainval/pCHWOt3FOgY/50015 LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT I'VE DONE
trainval/pCHWOt3FOgY/50016 WE DID IT TO TELL A DIFFERENT STORY ABOUT PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS TRYING TO
trainval/pCHWOt3FOgY/50017 WHAT IS GOING ON
trainval/pCHWOt3FOgY/50018 THAT ENABLES OUR KIDS AND OUR FRIENDS TO FALL IN LOVE WITH SCIENCE
trainval/pcNxS2i7SvQ/50001 I WAS IN MY CAR WITH MY THREE CHILDREN MY SON AND TWO DAUGHTERS ALL UNDER THE AGE OF 10
trainval/pcNxS2i7SvQ/50002 THE MORE WE CONDONE THE DEHUMANIZATION OF THE MUSLIM THE MORE WE TOLERATE THE VIOLENCE
trainval/pcNxS2i7SvQ/50003 WE SHARE YUSOR DEAH AND RAZAN'S STORY
trainval/PcQwHHbjZ0A/50001 I SEE THAT YOU GET VERY TIRED
trainval/pcSlowAhvUk/50001 I GET OUT A PEN I WRITE DOWN MY EMAIL ADDRESS
trainval/pcSlowAhvUk/50002 I SAY HERE'S MY EMAIL ADDRESS
trainval/pcSlowAhvUk/50003 IT'S A VERY DESOLATE PLACE
trainval/pcSlowAhvUk/50004 WE MAKE JUDGMENTS EVERY SINGLE DAY ABOUT THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE SAY AND THINK AND DO THAT WE'RE WILLING TO HAVE OTHER PEOPLE
trainval/pcSlowAhvUk/50005 WE CAN TRY AND RENDER THE CHAINS OF MASS SURVEILLANCE INVISIBLE OR UNDETECTABLE BUT THE CONSTRAINTS THAT IT
trainval/pcSlowAhvUk/50006 TO ME THAT'S THE ESSENCE OF JOURNALISM AND THAT'S WHAT I'M COMMITTED TO DOING
trainval/pcSlowAhvUk/50007 TO ME THAT'S THE WAY THAT PRIVACY CAN BE REJUVENATED
trainval/pcSlowAhvUk/50008 HE TRIED NOT TO EVER HAVE HIS PERSONAL LIFE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION AND SO I THINK CALLING HIM
trainval/PDefVd8DRxM/50001 SO I SUGGEST THAT IF WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE HUMAN MIND WE HAVE TO START AT THE BEGINNING AND STUDY THE BRAINS OF BABIES
trainval/PDefVd8DRxM/50002 I STUDY HUMAN BRAIN DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE I WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE HUMAN MIND IS BUILT AND MAYBE BE ABLE TO HELP FIX
trainval/PDefVd8DRxM/50003 NOW HUMAN BABIES ARE A HARD POPULATION TO STUDY AT THE BEST OF TIMES
trainval/PDefVd8DRxM/50004 IF YOU MOVE AT ALL WHILE WE'RE TAKING THE PICTURE ALL WE SEE IS A BLUR
trainval/PDefVd8DRxM/50005 AND THAT WAS OKAY BECAUSE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM SAID THIS WHOLE THING WAS DOOMED ANYWAY FMRI ING BABIES IS OBVIOUSLY
trainval/PDKKOSJX6yQ/50001 HOWEVER I WILL SAY WHEN MOST PEOPLE MEET ME THEY ARE DISAPPOINTED
trainval/PDKKOSJX6yQ/50002 I WANT TO GO REALLY FAST
trainval/pDsAqCEo5CY/50001 WE ARE HERE TO TALK ABOUT IDEAS
trainval/pDsAqCEo5CY/50002 I THINK IDEAS ARE POWERFUL
trainval/pDsAqCEo5CY/50003 YOU CAN CONTROL ALL OF THOSE THINGS
trainval/pDsAqCEo5CY/50004 EVERY CATCALL IS A BARREL CALLING ME HOME
trainval/pDsAqCEo5CY/50006 WHAT COMFORT ARE WORDS TO A WOMAN ON FIRE
trainval/pDsAqCEo5CY/50007 SO I'M MAKING A LIST OF ALL THE THINGS I WISHED I HAVE SAID
trainval/PdxPCeWw75k/50001 I LOST ALL HOPE
trainval/PENkzh0tWJs/50001 AND THERE WILL BE BACKLASH THERE ALWAYS IS
trainval/PENkzh0tWJs/50002 MY NAME IS TRACEY SPICER AND I'M NO LONGER A VAIN FOOL
trainval/PENkzh0tWJs/50003 AND YET EVERY TIME I GO OUT WITHOUT MAKE UP THE COMMENTS ARE ALWAYS THE SAME
trainval/PENkzh0tWJs/50004 MOST OF US COULDN'T
trainval/PENkzh0tWJs/50006 WHATEVER IT IS THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO AS A KID
trainval/PENkzh0tWJs/50007 YOU MIGHT AS WELL THINK ABOUT THINGS YOU WANTED TO DO AS A KID AND THINK RIGHT I CAN DO THAT NOW
trainval/PENkzh0tWJs/50008 I MEAN IT IS EXPENSIVE AND IT IS FULL OF NASTY CHEMICALS
trainval/PENUoKd5Feo/50001 HOW ABOUT 30 PEOPLE
trainval/PENUoKd5Feo/50002 HOW ABOUT 100 PEOPLE
trainval/PENUoKd5Feo/50003 WHAT IF SCHOOLS COULD PLAY WITH IT AND ACTUALLY CHANGE THE CODE ON IT
trainval/Peu7eeGtmQ4/50001 BUT THEY ASKED ONE QUESTION
trainval/Peu7eeGtmQ4/50002 THE NEXT ISSUE THAT RESOLVED WAS THAT IF 90 PERCENT OF HEAD AND NECK PAIN IS CAUSED BY
trainval/Peu7eeGtmQ4/50003 I DON'T KNOW WHAT I HAD IN MY MIND
trainval/Peu7eeGtmQ4/50004 AND HE WAS WALKING AROUND
trainval/Peu7eeGtmQ4/50005 AND IT WORKS
trainval/Peu7eeGtmQ4/50006 AND IT ACCELERATES THE AMOUNT AND LEVEL OF THE STIMULATION
trainval/Peu7eeGtmQ4/50007 THE AUDIENCE IS TOO SMALL
trainval/Peu7eeGtmQ4/50008 TO BE INTERESTED
trainval/pew48bbrob0/50001 THERE ARE SCENARIOS BY THE UNITED NATIONS' FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION THAT OUR FISHERIES MIGHT
trainval/pew48bbrob0/50002 THE MOST POWERFUL GAME CHANGER IS ACTUALLY USING THE SAME
trainval/pew48bbrob0/50003 THEN A SPECIAL INTERESTING KIND OF PLANTS THAT DOES THIS ARE THE MICROALGAE
trainval/pew48bbrob0/50004 ONE OF THE COMPOUNDS THAT THESE MICROALGAE PRODUCE ARE ACTUALLY OMEGA 3S THE SAME OMEGA
trainval/pew48bbrob0/50005 THAT IS I THINK WHAT WE CAN DO BY THE MEANS OF BUSINESS AND PROFIT
trainval/pF72px2R3Hg/50001 NOW ZERO WASTE THAT'S A PRETTY BIG IDEA
trainval/pF72px2R3Hg/50002 I ONLY HAVE WHAT I REALLY NEED
trainval/pF72px2R3Hg/50003 THE SECOND WAS PRODUCT PACKAGING AND SO I LEARNED HOW TO MAKE ALL OF MY OWN PRODUCTS
trainval/pF72px2R3Hg/50004 WELL AT THE SAME TIME I WAS STILL RUNNING MY BLOG
trainval/pF72px2R3Hg/50005 BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE WE AS HUMAN BEINGS HAVE A RIGHT TO PRODUCTS THAT ARE SAFE FOR OUR HOMES AND OUR BODIES
trainval/PFVP8L3SlfQ/50001 YOU COULD SUPPORT YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY AND YOU WOULD BE HAPPY
trainval/PFVP8L3SlfQ/50002 EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN UNIQUE TALENTS AND IDEAS THAT THEY WANT TO SHARE BUT IT STARTS WHEN WE LISTEN TO
trainval/PgCmT0qkfQM/50001 SHE WAS BORN TO REFUGEE PARENTS AND NOW SHE'S A REFUGEE HERSELF IN LEBANON
trainval/PgCmT0qkfQM/50002 THAT'S WHAT LONG TERM DISPLACEMENT MEANS
trainval/PgCmT0qkfQM/50003 THEY WERE SUPPORTED INTO WORK
trainval/PgCmT0qkfQM/50004 GET NO EDUCATION AT ALL AND THREE QUARTERS OF SECONDARY SCHOOL AGE GET NO EDUCATION AT ALL
trainval/PgCmT0qkfQM/50005 NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO BE BANNING REFUGEES AS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES
trainval/PgCmT0qkfQM/50006 SO WHILE IT'S REASONABLE TO ASK THE QUESTION IT'S NOT REASONABLE TO SAY THAT REFUGEE IS ANOTHER WORD FOR TERRORIST
trainval/PgCmT0qkfQM/50007 WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY TAKE RISKY JOURNEYS
trainval/PgCmT0qkfQM/50008 IT'S A HOME TO 90000 PEOPLE
trainval/PgCmT0qkfQM/50009 IN ONE YEAR 500000 REFUGEES WENT ACROSS THE ISLAND
trainval/PgCmT0qkfQM/50010 THEY DO COME FROM FARAWAY PARTS OF THE WORLD
trainval/PgCmT0qkfQM/50011 IT'S ALSO REVEALING ABOUT WHETHER WE KNOW OUR OWN HISTORY
trainval/PgCmT0qkfQM/50012 REFUGEES SEEKING SANCTUARY HAVE SEEN THE WEST AS A SOURCE OF HOPE AND A PLACE OF
trainval/PgCmT0qkfQM/50013 THE MOST VULNERABLE REFUGEES NEED TO BE GIVEN A NEW START AND A NEW LIFE IN A NEW COUNTRY
trainval/PgCmT0qkfQM/50014 AND SO MY ANSWER WOULD BE THE LEADERSHIP HAS GOT TO COME FROM BELOW NOT FROM ABOVE
trainval/pGSQG0IyNTo/50001 IF WE LOOK AT THE ENTIRE 4
trainval/pGSQG0IyNTo/50002 AND IT WAS A CREATURE VASTLY DIFFERENT TO OURSELVES
trainval/pGSQG0IyNTo/50003 AND IT STILL HAPPENS TODAY
trainval/pGSQG0IyNTo/50004 HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT SEX TODAY
trainval/pGSQG0IyNTo/50005 BUT IF CONDITIONS CHANGE AND BECOME UNFAVORABLE HYDRA WILL ACTUALLY TURN TO SEXUAL REPRODUCTION BY ACTUALLY
trainval/pGSQG0IyNTo/50006 2 BILLION YEARS
trainval/PGsQwAu3PzU/50001 THESE ARE THE STUFF OF THOUGHT THESE WERE THE STUFF OF COMMUNICATION
trainval/PGsQwAu3PzU/50002 AND IN FACT IF I TOOK THAT NOTE TO THIS AUTHOR NOW 6 MONTHS LATER AND SAY WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT
trainval/PGsQwAu3PzU/50003 THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT THE AUTHOR WILL SAY NO IDEA
trainval/PGsQwAu3PzU/50004 NOW IT TURNS OUT SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE IN THE WORLD USE THESE THIRD PERSON PRONOUNS AT HIGH RATES AND OTHER PEOPLE
trainval/PGsQwAu3PzU/50005 SO KEEPING A SECRET IT SEEMS IS SOMEHOW TOXIC
trainval/PGsQwAu3PzU/50006 THROW AWAY DEPRESSION FOR JUST A SECOND
trainval/PGsQwAu3PzU/50007 AND THE ANSWER IS YES
trainval/pGyOwnqpCKk/50001 AT THE TIME THAT THIS CROP WAS BEING
trainval/pGyOwnqpCKk/50002 ORG THANK YOU
trainval/Phf66nAoMIk/50001 THE FIRST E IS ENVIRONMENT
trainval/Phf66nAoMIk/50002 SO LET'S DO THIS I'M GOING TO TAKE A DOG THAT COMES FROM WHERE I COME FROM ON ST
trainval/Phf66nAoMIk/50003 OUR YOUNG PEOPLE LIVE IN A BOX
trainval/Phf66nAoMIk/50004 AND WE WONDER WHY THEY CAN'T THINK OUTSIDE OF IT
trainval/Phf66nAoMIk/50005 WHY IS THAT
trainval/Phf66nAoMIk/50006 I HEARD SOMEBODY
trainval/Phf66nAoMIk/50009 MUFASA SAYS YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN YOURSELF THEREFORE YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN ME
trainval/phUUjkSbtiY/50001 I HAD A GOOD DAY
trainval/phUUjkSbtiY/50002 I KEPT THINKING TO MYSELF THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS HOSPITAL WHO KNOW A LOT MORE THAN I DO
trainval/phUUjkSbtiY/50003 AND I WOULD SAY HEY WAIT A SECOND
trainval/phUUjkSbtiY/50004 SO THIS IS WHAT WE LEARN IN THE ONE ROOM SCHOOLHOUSE
trainval/phUUjkSbtiY/50005 HOW TO INTRODUCE HERSELF
trainval/phUUjkSbtiY/50006 JUST SIT DOWN
trainval/phUUjkSbtiY/50007 THIS IS THE SCARECROW PART THAT WE LEARN ABOUT
trainval/pi9SMFWTzXw/50001 ONE DAY I REFUSED TO LET HER DO THAT TO ME
trainval/pi9SMFWTzXw/50002 WHO'S DEFINING WHO YOU ARE AND HOW DO WE DEFINE OURSELVES
trainval/pi9SMFWTzXw/50003 THE GIRLFRIEND BOYFRIEND WE HAVE
trainval/pi9SMFWTzXw/50004 HOW SKINNY WE ARE
trainval/pi9SMFWTzXw/50005 HOW SMART WE ARE
trainval/pi9SMFWTzXw/50006 STEP ONE DISCOVERED TRUTH
trainval/pi9SMFWTzXw/50007 WHAT'S STEP THREE
trainval/pi9SMFWTzXw/50008 YOU GO OUT AND START CHANGING THOSE THINGS
trainval/pi9SMFWTzXw/50009 IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE OVERNIGHT
trainval/pi9SMFWTzXw/50010 IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS OF TRYING TO OVERCOME THINGS
trainval/pi9SMFWTzXw/50011 SEE WE GET THE PRINCIPAL OF CHANGE BACKWARDS BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT DIALED INTO YOUR POTENTIAL TO WHO YOU ARE GOOD
trainval/pi9SMFWTzXw/50012 THE LAST STEP IS MAYBE THE MOST CRITICAL OF ALL
trainval/piCQ3StcRUQ/50001 NOT VERY WELL IT TURNS OUT
trainval/piCQ3StcRUQ/50002 THERE ARE SEVEN QUESTIONS
trainval/piCQ3StcRUQ/50003 THEY CAN SURPRISE US ALL
trainval/piCQ3StcRUQ/50004 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/pimgaSjgwWQ/50001 I WAS HEALTHY ONCE MORE
trainval/pimgaSjgwWQ/50002 BUT I ONLY FOUND MORE GAPS BECAUSE I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHY THERE IS ONE STUFF WHICH IS RED AND
trainval/pimgaSjgwWQ/50003 THAT WORD I DON'T KNOW
trainval/pimgaSjgwWQ/50004 AND THAT'S WHERE ENTERS ANOTHER PART
trainval/pimgaSjgwWQ/50005 MAYBE I'LL CONTINUE RESEARCHING
trainval/PiVB5niLrWg/50001 BUT SHE WAS TRADITIONAL
trainval/PiVB5niLrWg/50002 BY CONTRAST MUCH LIKE I STILL AM TODAY I WAS WHAT JUNGIAN ANALYSTS MAY CALL AN
trainval/PiVB5niLrWg/50003 SHE WAS POLITE AND DID NOT LIKE TO TAKE UP TOO MUCH SPACE
trainval/PiVB5niLrWg/50004 SHE WAS FIRM BUT NOT STRICT
trainval/PiVB5niLrWg/50005 SHE WAS A TOUGH WOMAN AROUND WHOM EVEN THE UNRULIEST OF CHILDREN TRANSFORMED INTO BEACONS OF
trainval/PiVB5niLrWg/50006 AND IN BOTH CASES WOMEN WOULD RISE AND FEMINISM WOULD GAIN WOMEN RIGHTS
trainval/PiVB5niLrWg/50007 NOW IF THE MEDIA PROJECT THESE ONE DIMENSIONAL STEREOTYPES UNFORTUNATELY AFRICAN MEN
trainval/PiVB5niLrWg/50008 SHE WAS NOT UNAFFECTIONATE HOWEVER
trainval/PiVB5niLrWg/50009 SHE WOULD OFTEN SIT WITH HER ARMS WRAPPED AROUND ME FOR HOURS TELLING ME STORIES EVEN THOUGH HER ENGLISH WAS POOR
trainval/pj2YxCAnqx0/50001 AND SHE SAID YOU ARE NOT
trainval/pj2YxCAnqx0/50002 I SAID WHAT DO YOU MEAN
trainval/pj2YxCAnqx0/50003 EVERYBODY KNOWS IT
trainval/pj2YxCAnqx0/50004 AND THEY HAVE GREAT KIDS AND THEY'VE GOT A GREAT LIFE
trainval/pj2YxCAnqx0/50005 WE ARE WORKING TO CHANGE THE LAWS TO REFLECT THAT
trainval/pj2YxCAnqx0/50006 I HEARD THE COMEDIAN WANDA SYKES IN THE PERFECT STATEMENT
trainval/pj2YxCAnqx0/50007 AND WE DO IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
trainval/pj2YxCAnqx0/50008 BUT WHEN WE'RE TALKING I ALWAYS HAVE TO REMIND THEM THAT I'M OVER HERE WITH COUSINS THAT WRITE
trainval/pj2YxCAnqx0/50009 AND I SAID WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
trainval/pj2YxCAnqx0/50010 SHE SHOULD JUST START TALKING
trainval/PJUIXSpLoVk/50001 I DIDN'T WANT TO LOOK THE CASHIER IN THE EYE AND I DIDN'T WANT ANYONE TO SEE ME WITH THE BOX ON MY WAY HOME FROM THE STORE
trainval/PJUIXSpLoVk/50002 SO I FORCED MY MOM TO GO AND DO IT FOR ME
trainval/PJUIXSpLoVk/50003 A BUNCH OF MY GRADEMATES AND CLASSMATES WERE CIRCLED AROUND THIS ONE THING AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS BUT I REALLY WANTED TO FIND OUT
trainval/PJUIXSpLoVk/50004 HOW CAN WE GET A WORLD WHERE 50 OF ALL CODING JOBS ARE HELD BY WOMEN INSTEAD OF ONLY 27
trainval/PJUIXSpLoVk/50005 FIRSTLY WE SHOULD HAVE MORE FEMALE ROLE MODELS WHO CODE BECAUSE BY HAVING MORE FEMALE ROLE MODELS WHO CODE GIRLS CAN SEE
trainval/PJUIXSpLoVk/50006 SECONDLY WE SHOULD HAVE A MORE NURTURING ENVIRONMENT FOR WOMEN TO LEARN IN THE TECH INDUSTRY BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE IS A LOT OF SEXISM
trainval/PJUIXSpLoVk/50007 SO I WORKED MY WAY INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD AND LYING THERE FOR EVERYONE TO SEE WAS AN UNWRAPPED UNUSED
trainval/PJUIXSpLoVk/50008 PEOPLE WERE FREAKING OUT
trainval/PJy8vTu66tE/50001 BLACKS CAN VOTE IN THE GENERAL ELECTIONS IF OF COURSE THEY COULD GET REGISTERED GIVEN ALL THE BARRIERS TO REGISTRATION
trainval/PJy8vTu66tE/50003 I'M TALKING ABOUT INEQUALITY WE HAVE AS CITIZENS
trainval/pk35J2u8KqY/50001 IN 2009 I STARTED A RESEARCH POSITION WITH NOKIA
trainval/pk35J2u8KqY/50002 AND NOW THEIR STOCKS ARE PROJECTED TO DOUBLE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS
trainval/PkcBE74OYJw/50001 IT'S CALLED THEY SAY THAT FISH
trainval/PkcBE74OYJw/50002 BUT I'VE MOVED ON
trainval/PkcBE74OYJw/50003 PART OF ME'S INTERMINABLE IT GOES ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND
trainval/pkGAMb5sYvg/50001 THE SPEED OF ROLLING OUT OF RENEWABLES IS STAGGERING
trainval/pkGAMb5sYvg/50002 WE HAD JUST FIVE WEEKS TO RAISE THE 350000 POUNDS THAT WE NEEDED AS WELL AS TO
trainval/pkGAMb5sYvg/50003 GERMANY HAS BEEN AN OBVIOUS PIONEER OF THE ENERGY TRANSITION WITH OVER ONE THIRD OF THEIR ELECTRICITY COMING FROM RENEWABLE
trainval/pkGAMb5sYvg/50004 THEY WERE UNDER THE RADIATION CLOUD FROM THE CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR DISASTER
trainval/pkGAMb5sYvg/50005 AT FIRST THEY WORKED TO SAVE ENERGY
trainval/pkGAMb5sYvg/50006 IT'S TIME TO TAKE IT BACK
trainval/pkZtRzc9rFQ/50001 AND FOR THE MOST PART THE STORIES ARE RECYCLED
trainval/pkZtRzc9rFQ/50002 IT WAS VENERABLE
trainval/Pl8OlkkwRpc/50001 AND IT'S NOT SOCIAL MEDIA
trainval/Pl8OlkkwRpc/50002 OUR PRIVACY IS BEING UNDERMINED
trainval/Pl8OlkkwRpc/50003 WHAT IF THERE WERE A NATIVE MEDIUM FOR VALUE
trainval/Pl8OlkkwRpc/50004 IT'S NOT A FIAT CURRENCY CONTROLLED BY A NATION STATE
trainval/Pl8OlkkwRpc/50005 AND THAT'S OF GREATER INTEREST
trainval/Pl8OlkkwRpc/50006 SO TODAY THERE ARE COMPANIES WORKING TO CREATE AN IDENTITY IN A BLACK
trainval/Pl8OlkkwRpc/50007 AND THEN THIS AVATAR IS SWEEPING UP ALL OF THIS DATA AND ENABLING YOU TO
trainval/Pl8OlkkwRpc/50008 YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO THE SONG
trainval/Pl8OlkkwRpc/50009 YOU WANT TO PUT THE SONG IN YOUR MOVIE THAT'S DIFFERENT AND THE IP RIGHTS ARE ALL SPECIFIED
trainval/Pl8OlkkwRpc/50010 YOU WANT TO MAKE A RINGTONE
trainval/Pl8OlkkwRpc/50011 THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T GET FAIR COMPENSATION AND WITH BLOCKCHAINS THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE
trainval/Pl8OlkkwRpc/50012 MUSICIANS ARE LEFT WITH CRUMBS AT THE END OF THE WHOLE FOOD CHAIN
trainval/PL9wP3pAl7A/50001 IT WAS WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO A YOUNG WELSH AMERICAN SOLDIER IN MILITARY DETENTION IN THE
trainval/PL9wP3pAl7A/50002 AND IT SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO STAND
trainval/PL9wP3pAl7A/50003 AND ALTHOUGH I DIDN'T REALISE IT AT THE TIME OR FULLY APPRECIATED IT AT THE TIME ONCE YOU HAVE A DEEP SENSE THAT
trainval/PL9wP3pAl7A/50004 WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUT ON THE STREETS
trainval/PL9wP3pAl7A/50005 IT'S ALMOST INEVITABLE
trainval/PL9wP3pAl7A/50006 THERE'S A FEELING OF INEVITABILITY THAT SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN LONDON
trainval/PL9wP3pAl7A/50007 I FIND OUT ABOUT THE LONDON PLANS IN THE WAY AS MOST PEOPLE DO
trainval/PL9wP3pAl7A/50008 I STUMBLED ACROSS ONE OF THE FIVE DIFFERENT FACEBOOK PAGES WHICH WERE GOING
trainval/PL9wP3pAl7A/50009 WE HAD NO IDEA HOW
trainval/PL9wP3pAl7A/50010 WE HAD NO IDEA THAT WE WERE GOING TO END UP OUTSIDE SAINT PAUL'S CATHEDRAL FOR FIVE MONTHS
trainval/PL9wP3pAl7A/50011 FOR ONE THING YOU ARE AIMING TO OCCUPY OUTSIDE THE STOCK EXCHANGE
trainval/PL9wP3pAl7A/50012 BUT THERE'S ANOTHER DIMENSION TO THIS WHICH I THINK IS WORTH THINKING ABOUT
trainval/PL9wP3pAl7A/50013 IN THE SAME WAY WE CAN SEE NOW IT'S A MISTAKE LEAVING POLITICS UP TO THE POLITICIANS
trainval/PL9wP3pAl7A/50014 AND I THINK ONLY BY DOING THAT CAN WE REALLY BASE THE STANDS OF OUR DEMOCRACY
trainval/PL9wP3pAl7A/50015 AND NONE OF THIS HAD TO BE CONSCIOUSLY DIRECTED
trainval/PL9wP3pAl7A/50016 I THINK WE'D MADE PROVISION FOR A GENERATOR TO TURN UP FOR DAY TWO IF WE MANAGED TO STAY OVERNIGHT
trainval/pLCeQyxVWB8/50001 IT WAS KNOCK YOU OFF YOUR FEET LYING ON THE COLD BATHROOM FLOOR ALTERNATING BETWEEN
trainval/PlQ3VdvvTvE/50001 IT ALL STARTED WHEN WE AT CERN SAW SOMETHING INTRIGUING IN OUR DATA
trainval/PlQ3VdvvTvE/50002 TO DISCOVER NEW PARTICLES WE NEED TO REACH THESE BIGGER NUMBERS
trainval/PlQ3VdvvTvE/50003 AND TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO BUILD A BIGGER HIGHER ENERGY COLLIDER AND THE BIGGEST HIGHEST ENERGY COLLIDER IN THE WORLD
trainval/PlQ3VdvvTvE/50004 SO 2015 WAS GO TIME
trainval/PlQ3VdvvTvE/50005 AS A KID I WOULD PUZZLE OVER QUESTIONS JUST LIKE THIS
trainval/PlQ3VdvvTvE/50006 I WOULD FIDDLE AROUND WITH MICROSCOPES AND ELECTROMAGNETS AND I WOULD READ ABOUT THE FORCES OF THE SMALL AND ABOUT QUANTUM
trainval/PlQ3VdvvTvE/50007 AND THAT'S RARE
trainval/PlQ3VdvvTvE/50008 THEY HAVE DIFFERENT RULES
trainval/PlQ3VdvvTvE/50009 BUT ONE OF THESE OPTIONS IS HUGE AND IT HAS TO DO WITH THAT LONG STANDING QUESTION THAT
trainval/PlQ3VdvvTvE/50010 BUT MATH IS MATH AND WE CAN PLAY AROUND WITH OUR MATH HOWEVER WE WANT
trainval/PlQ3VdvvTvE/50011 AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PLAYING AROUND WITH EXTRA DIMENSIONS OF SPACE FOR A VERY LONG TIME BUT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN AN ABSTRACT MATHEMATICAL
trainval/PlQ3VdvvTvE/50012 I SEE THE LOOKS ON YOUR FACES
trainval/PlQ3VdvvTvE/50013 WE NEED MORE DATA
trainval/PlQ3VdvvTvE/50014 THAT'S THE STAGE WE'RE AT NOW
trainval/PlQ3VdvvTvE/50015 BUT THEN WHAT DO WE DO
trainval/PlQ3VdvvTvE/50016 DO WE JUST GIVE UP AND FLY AWAY
trainval/PlQ3VdvvTvE/50017 ABSOLUTELY NOT WE WOULD BE TERRIBLE SCIENTISTS IF WE DID
trainval/PlQ3VdvvTvE/50018 NO WE SPEND THE NEXT COUPLE OF DECADES EXPLORING MAPPING OUT THE TERRITORY SIFTING THROUGH THE
trainval/PlQ3VdvvTvE/50019 WE DON'T DECIDE WHERE NATURE PLACES NEW PARTICLES
trainval/PlQ3VdvvTvE/50020 WE ONLY DECIDE TO KEEP EXPLORING
trainval/PlQ3VdvvTvE/50021 WE ALREADY USE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES IN PARTS OF THE LHC BUT IMAGINE DESIGNING A PARTICLE
trainval/PlQ3VdvvTvE/50022 BUT WHAT IF
trainval/PlQ3VdvvTvE/50023 WHAT IF THE ULTIMATE QUESTION
trainval/PlQ3VdvvTvE/50024 WHAT IF THE STUFF THAT'S BOTHERED ME SINCE I WAS A LITTLE KID IS DESTINED TO BE UNANSWERED IN MY LIFETIME
trainval/PlQ3VdvvTvE/50025 AND WE'LL NEED TO ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE TO JOIN US IN STUDYING SCIENCE SINCE WE NEED FRESH EYES ON THESE CENTURY OLD
trainval/pLqjQ55tzSU/50001 HOW MUCH OF THIS DIAGRAM DO YOU THINK MIGHT BE TAKEN UP BY THE DEBT THAT AFRICA OWES TO THE WEST
trainval/pLqjQ55tzSU/50002 BUT WHAT I LOVE AND I'M A JOURNALIST AND WHAT I LOVE IS FINDING HIDDEN PATTERNS I LOVE BEING A DATA DETECTIVE
trainval/pLqjQ55tzSU/50003 AND I'VE NEVER BEEN TO DESIGN SCHOOL
trainval/pLqjQ55tzSU/50004 AND WHEN I STARTED DESIGNING I DISCOVERED AN ODD THING ABOUT MYSELF
trainval/pLqjQ55tzSU/50005 THEY'RE NOT AS TRUE AS THEY COULD BE
trainval/Pmbkx71iedM/50001 QUITE TO THE CONTRARY I WAS A TOMBOY
trainval/Pmbkx71iedM/50002 MORE THAN A TOMBOY I WAS A TROUBLE MAKER
trainval/Pmbkx71iedM/50003 SO HOW WE FEEL WE APPEAR TO OTHERS IS ENOURMOUSLY IMPORTANT TO OUR LIVES
trainval/Pmbkx71iedM/50004 AND IT'S ALL AROUND
trainval/PMBWNbj2awk/50001 AND THEY DID JUST THAT
trainval/PMBWNbj2awk/50002 FOR EXAMPLE THEY TOOK CLAY AND FIRE AND MADE CERAMICS AND POTTERY
trainval/PMBWNbj2awk/50003 AND THESE PEOPLE WERE AS WELL
trainval/PMBWNbj2awk/50004 BUT FRANKLY THAT'S JUST HALF THE STORY
trainval/PMBWNbj2awk/50005 SPACES BEING PLACES THEY COULD OCCUPY
trainval/PMBWNbj2awk/50006 I'VE GOT AN IDEA
trainval/PMBWNbj2awk/50007 I DO KNOW THAT PROSTITUTION IS ALL ABOUT TRADING SEX FOR THINGS OF VALUE
trainval/PMBWNbj2awk/50008 BUT IT IS THIS THIRD CATEGORY THAT IS MOST INTRIGUING TO US THOSE OF US AGAIN WHO ARE DESIGNERS
trainval/PMBWNbj2awk/50009 MY FOURTH OBSERVATION HAS TO DO WITH METHODOLOGY
trainval/PMBWNbj2awk/50010 SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE VERY FIRST HUMANS VERY FIRST HUMANS ON THIS EARTH FOR THEM THINGS
trainval/PMBWNbj2awk/50011 THEY WERE STICKS AND STONES AND BONES AND ANTLERS AND MINERALS AND FOR
trainval/pmKNXZmfIMU/50001 EMOTIONALLY INSTEAD OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT OUR EMOTIONS ARE TELLING US WE BECOME HIJACKED BY THOSE SAME EMOTIONS WE
trainval/pmKNXZmfIMU/50002 WHAT WE'RE LEFT WITH ARE CHOICES THAT TEND TO BE IRRATIONAL AND REACTIVE IN NATURE
trainval/pmKNXZmfIMU/50003 AND THAT'S IF WE EVEN CAN MAKE CHOICES BECAUSE A LOT OF THE TIMES WE BECOME INDECISIVE WE JUST
trainval/pmKNXZmfIMU/50004 IT INFLUENCES HOW WE APPROACH CHALLENGING OR PROBLEMATIC SITUATIONS OR TO HOW WE COMMUNICATE TO OTHERS BUT
trainval/pmKNXZmfIMU/50005 WE USE A NUMBER OF FILTERS ON THESE THINGS
trainval/pmKNXZmfIMU/50006 YOU PASS THOUSANDS OF CARS TO AND FROM WHEREVER YOU ARE GOING EVERY DAY
trainval/pmKNXZmfIMU/50007 I MEAN THAT'S YOUR BELIEF
trainval/pmKNXZmfIMU/50008 NOW THIS IS WHAT WE CALL THE THINKING MINDSET
trainval/pmKNXZmfIMU/50009 NOW OTHER COGNITIVE OR HIGHER THINKING SKILLS THAT CHARACTERIZE THIS MINDSET ARE
trainval/pmKNXZmfIMU/50010 IF THE SECOND GATEKEEPER TENDS TO TAG POSITIVE OR CONSTRUCTIVE MEANING TO THAT RAW FEELING IT
trainval/pmKNXZmfIMU/50011 AND WHAT HAPPENS THEN
trainval/pmKNXZmfIMU/50012 BETWEEN WHAT BRAIN SCIENCE KNOWS AND WHAT PEOPLE DO AND WHAT BUSINESSES DO
trainval/pMNxSROBwrg/50001 HE SAID WELL I JUST TOLD YOU I FAILED MY EXAMS
trainval/pMUv6UWkuWw/50001 SO WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME
trainval/pMUv6UWkuWw/50002 NOW THESE KINDS OF NATURAL RULES THAT EXIST IN YOUR BRAIN THEY'RE NOT LIKE TRAFFIC LAWS THEY'RE
trainval/pMUv6UWkuWw/50003 SO THESE ARE BLEND WORDS LIKE BRUNCH IS A BLEND OF BREAKFAST AND LUNCH
trainval/pMUv6UWkuWw/50004 MOTEL IS A BLEND OF MOTOR AND HOTEL
trainval/pMUv6UWkuWw/50005 YOU CAN ALSO TAKE ADJECTIVES AND MAKE THEM INTO NOUNS
trainval/pMUv6UWkuWw/50006 ABSQUATULATE IS A PERFECTLY GOOD WORD OF ENGLISH
trainval/pMUv6UWkuWw/50007 AND NEW WORDS GRAB PEOPLE'S ATTENTION
trainval/pMYYxSim5QI/50001 POWER WAS FOCUSED AT THE VERY TOP
trainval/pMYYxSim5QI/50002 AND IN THAT SITUATION SIFTING THROUGH THE WRECKAGE OF A SUICIDE DRONE ATTACK IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY WHO
trainval/pMYYxSim5QI/50003 WE HAVE LICENSE PLATES ON CARS TAIL NUMBERS ON AIRCRAFT
trainval/pn8p3rOaA5I/50001 HE WAS A FIRST CENTURY B
trainval/pn8p3rOaA5I/50002 THEN SHE WENT BACK AND FORTH
trainval/pn8p3rOaA5I/50003 YOU'RE ALL DONE
trainval/PnMsSqLwaes/50001 AS IT GOT DARK 2 OF OUR CAPTORS FORCED US TO DROP EVERYTHING AND RUN WITH THEM
trainval/PnMsSqLwaes/50002 I NOTICED MY NIGHT VISION IMPROVING
trainval/PnMsSqLwaes/50004 I WAS AWARE OF EVERY SOUND EVERY MOVEMENT
trainval/PnMsSqLwaes/50005 MY GIRLFRIEND AND I WITH 2 FRIENDS HAD HELICOPTERED INTO A REMOTE MOUNTAIN REGION IN SOUTHWEST KYRGYZSTAN
trainval/PnMsSqLwaes/50006 ON OUR 8TH DAY WE WOKE TO GUNSHOTS HUNTERS I THOUGHT
trainval/PnMsSqLwaes/50007 WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE
trainval/PnMsSqLwaes/50008 MY SISTER WAS 6 I WAS TWO AND A HALF AND STILL IN DIAPERS AND WE WERE SLEEPING IN A SNOW CAVE DEEP IN
trainval/PnMsSqLwaes/50009 BUT THIS WAS ALSO THE END OF A 7 YEAR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DAWN WALL
trainval/PnMsSqLwaes/50010 WE KEEP DOING IT
trainval/pNttjJUtkA4/50001 SOME GIVE IT ENERGY OTHERS TRANSPORT THINGS BACK AND FORTH KIND OF LIKE A METRO SYSTEM OR A RAILROAD
trainval/Possj5cXEnM/50001 IT WAS MUCH HARDER
trainval/Possj5cXEnM/50002 SO IN 2013 MY FRIEND BENJAMIN LAIRD AND I WE CREATED A TURING TEST FOR POETRY ONLINE
trainval/Possj5cXEnM/50003 WHAT IS A COMPUTER
trainval/Possj5cXEnM/50004 SO THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN THIS TEST ONLINE SO WE HAVE RESULTS
trainval/Possj5cXEnM/50005 WELL YES ABSOLUTELY IT CAN
trainval/Possj5cXEnM/50006 IT'S JUST RAW MATERIAL
trainval/Possj5cXEnM/50007 SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TRY A DIFFERENT APPROACH
trainval/Possj5cXEnM/50008 SO MY FIRST INSIGHT IS THAT FOR SOME REASON WE ASSOCIATE POETRY WITH BEING
trainval/Possj5cXEnM/50009 WE'RE ALSO ASKING WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE HUMAN AND HOW DO WE PUT BOUNDARIES AROUND
trainval/Possj5cXEnM/50010 HOW DO WE SAY WHO OR WHAT CAN BE PART OF THIS CATEGORY
trainval/Possj5cXEnM/50011 SO MY FINAL INSIGHT IS THAT THE COMPUTER MORE OR LESS WORKS LIKE A MIRROR THAT
trainval/Possj5cXEnM/50012 WE SHOW IT WILLIAM BLAKE THAT'S WHAT IT REFLECTS BACK TO US
trainval/Possj5cXEnM/50013 WE SHOW IT GERTRUDE STEIN WHAT WE GET BACK IS GERTRUDE STEIN
trainval/Possj5cXEnM/50014 MORE THAN ANY OTHER BIT OF TECHNOLOGY THE COMPUTER IS A MIRROR THAT REFLECTS ANY IDEA OF THE
trainval/Possj5cXEnM/50015 CAN WE BUILD A CREATIVE COMPUTER
trainval/Possj5cXEnM/50016 WHAT WE SEEM TO BE ASKING OVER AND OVER IS CAN WE BUILD A HUMAN LIKE COMPUTER
trainval/Possj5cXEnM/50017 BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN JUST NOW IS THAT THE HUMAN IS NOT A SCIENTIFIC FACT THAT IT'S AN EVER SHIFTING
trainval/Possj5cXEnM/50018 BUT WE SHOULD ALSO BE ASKING OURSELVES WHAT IDEA OF THE HUMAN DO WE WANT TO HAVE REFLECTED BACK TO US
trainval/Possj5cXEnM/50019 I ALSO BELIEVE THAT ALAN TURING UNDERSTOOD THIS AND THAT WHEN HE DEVISED HIS TEST BACK IN 1950
trainval/Possj5cXEnM/50020 IT SIMPLY MEANS THAT THE CATEGORY OF THE HUMAN IS UNSTABLE
trainval/potB0voQzNg/50001 AND THAT IN MY OPINION WAS THE TRIGGER
trainval/potB0voQzNg/50002 THEY ARE THE THREE COUNTRIES THAT ARE IN THE END RECEIVING THE REFUGEES
trainval/potB0voQzNg/50003 HOW DO YOU IMAGINE THESE PEOPLE REACTING
trainval/potB0voQzNg/50004 AND THEY ARE NOT
trainval/POTosC2q6Hs/50001 TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION BEHAVES A LOT LIKE WEALTH AND CAPITAL
trainval/POTosC2q6Hs/50002 IS THEIR EXPERIENCE CHANGED
trainval/POTosC2q6Hs/50003 AND SO THERE WAS A BIG MOVEMENT TO PUT ALL THIS INFORMATION ONLINE TO TRACK ALL THE
trainval/POTosC2q6Hs/50004 EVENTUALLY THESE INNOVATIONS WILL GET OUT AND FIND EVERYONE
trainval/POU1HjdXziM/50001 BECAUSE I WASN'T FROM PAKISTAN
trainval/POU1HjdXziM/50002 OUR BRAINS ARE WIRED TO RECOGNIZE PATTERNS
trainval/pOWgXxoSTNM/50001 BUT MY MOST PROFOUND APPRECIATION FOR IT CAME ON A TRIP TO ZIMBABWE WHEN I WAS A YOUNG LAWYER
trainval/pOWgXxoSTNM/50002 AND YET HERE WE WERE LESS THAN A MILE FROM AN ENORMOUS SOURCE OF FRESH WATER
trainval/pOWgXxoSTNM/50003 YET THE CHILDREN DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO ANY OF IT BECAUSE OF POOR GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND A LACK OF
trainval/pOWgXxoSTNM/50004 NO IT'S NOT THE INTERNET
trainval/pOWgXxoSTNM/50005 IT'S TRANSPORTED INTO YOUR HOME THANKS TO A LOCAL WATER AGENCY OR THROUGH A PIPE AND A PUMP OR
trainval/pOWgXxoSTNM/50006 BUT DO WE REALLY KNOW HOW MUCH WATER WE USE EVERY DAY
trainval/pOWgXxoSTNM/50007 THE AVERAGE AMERICAN USES ABOUT 100 GALLONS A DAY
trainval/pOWgXxoSTNM/50008 AND YET ARE THESE THINGS THE SAME VALUE IN TERMS OF MY LIFE
trainval/pOWgXxoSTNM/50009 IN CALIFORNIA HALF OF THE URBAN WATER USE IS FOR OUTDOOR IRRIGATION
trainval/pOWgXxoSTNM/50010 WE CAN ALSO MAKE SMART CHOICES AS CONSUMERS
trainval/pOWgXxoSTNM/50011 THINGS WE DO IN OUR HOMES THINGS WE BUY THINGS LIKE FAUCETS AND TOILETS AND SHOWER HEADS AND
trainval/pOWgXxoSTNM/50012 IF YOU HAVE A VERY EFFICIENT SHOWER HEAD IT'S ACTUALLY A 12 HOUR SHOWER
trainval/pOWgXxoSTNM/50013 THINK ABOUT THAT
trainval/pOWgXxoSTNM/50014 JUST LEAVE THE WATER ON ALL DAY WHEN YOU GO TO WORK
trainval/pOWgXxoSTNM/50015 THIS ISN'T TO JUDGE PEOPLE I EAT MEAT
trainval/pOWgXxoSTNM/50016 THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IN OUR COMMUNITIES AS WELL FOR SMARTER WATER USE THROUGH RE USE
trainval/pOWgXxoSTNM/50017 SIMPLE THINGS LIKE MOVING GENERATORS AND BOILERS TO THE SECOND FLOOR LIKE THEY'VE NOW
trainval/pOWgXxoSTNM/50018 WATER CAN BE A BLESSING OR A CURSE
trainval/pOWgXxoSTNM/50019 WE MUST RESPECT WATER
trainval/pOWgXxoSTNM/50020 AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT US
trainval/pOWgXxoSTNM/50021 ARE THEY REALLY THE BIGGEST WATER HOGS THOUGH
trainval/pPgd7Hj3ABQ/50001 IT STILL COUNTED
trainval/pPgd7Hj3ABQ/50002 BUT THINGS LIKE THIS HAPPEN IN THE WESTERN WORLD AS WELL AND THE YAP ACTUALLY STILL USE A FORM OF THESE
trainval/pPgd7Hj3ABQ/50003 AND BECAUSE WE'VE DECIDED THAT THEY DO
trainval/pPgd7Hj3ABQ/50004 AND EVERY MONTH A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY IS DEDUCTED FROM MY PAYCHECK AND INVESTED IN MUTUAL FUNDS IN MY
trainval/pPgd7Hj3ABQ/50005 AND WHEN IT DOESN'T IT'S OFTEN THE FAULT OF THOSE LARGE INSTITUTIONS
trainval/pPgd7Hj3ABQ/50006 OR AT LEAST IT'S UP TO THEM TO FIX THE PROBLEM
trainval/pPgd7Hj3ABQ/50007 OUR ACCESS TO DIGITAL MONEY AND OUR ABILITY TO FREELY TRANSACT IS BEING HELD
trainval/pPgd7Hj3ABQ/50008 NOW THE YAP DON'T ACTUALLY MOVE THESE RAI STONES AROUND OR EXCHANGE THEM THE WAY WE DO WITH
trainval/pPgd7Hj3ABQ/50009 AND THEY CAN PAY ME FOR WHAT THEY FIND OUT
trainval/pPgd7Hj3ABQ/50010 IMAGINE AN INTERNET WITHOUT ADS BECAUSE INSTEAD OF PAYING WITH OUR ATTENTION WHEN WE VIEW
trainval/pPgd7Hj3ABQ/50011 WILL WE ALL BECOME SLAVES TO ALGORITHMS AND UTILITY FUNCTIONS
trainval/pPgd7Hj3ABQ/50012 BUT IT ALSO GREATLY INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY
trainval/ppRtQCAbzPk/50001 AND THIS IS BECAUSE THE POPULARITY OF THE CASTRATO WAS SO VAST THAT EVERY SINGER NO MATTER IF THEY WERE A NON
trainval/ppRtQCAbzPk/50002 I THEN BREATHE DEEPLY INTO MY CORE WHICH ALLOWS THE AIR TO COME UP FAST AND FURIOUS FOR MAXIMUM
trainval/ppRtQCAbzPk/50003 AND MANY WILL SAY THAT THE REASON FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE VOCAL NODULES IS DOWN TO BAD VOCAL
trainval/ppRtQCAbzPk/50004 AND THAT IS THAT THEY CONSTANTLY PROMOTED THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL SINGER SHOULD UNDERSTAND THE
trainval/ppZ2WIlRvR8/50001 THE BARBERS WERE NOT ONLY WILLING TO DO IT BUT THEY WERE DAMN GOOD AT IT
trainval/ppZ2WIlRvR8/50002 ELI SAUNDERS IN BALTIMORE AND DR
trainval/pQcFJSo3jpw/50001 IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED FOR A LONG TIME
trainval/pQcFJSo3jpw/50002 THAT'S LOTS AND LOTS OF JOBS
trainval/pQcFJSo3jpw/50003 I'M SURE YOU GUYS ARE AWARE OF THE TRIALS
trainval/pQcFJSo3jpw/50004 THAT'S WHAT I'VE LEARNED FROM MY EXPERIENCE AND ALSO FROM A BIG IDEA THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED WHICH IS
trainval/pQcFJSo3jpw/50005 I KNOW THAT IT'S THE ONLY ONE
trainval/pQcFJSo3jpw/50006 JAITLEY TO ANNOUNCE IT IN THE BUDGET AS DID MANY OTHER PEOPLE
trainval/PrIvtWhI1DM/50001 WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO US ABOUT THE SUGAR PARTS WE'VE SHOWN YOU TODAY ISN'T THAT THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL BUT THAT THEY WERE
trainval/Pro06WQG77M/50001 PRETTY FAMILIAR STORY RIGHT
trainval/Pro06WQG77M/50002 A SKILLED COGNITIVE THERAPIST CAN HELP YOU CHANGE YOUR BRAIN TO STRENGTHEN THE CONNECTIONS THAT SUPPRESS FEAR
trainval/PRsopS7yTG8/50001 OUR MODERN FUNERARY PRACTICES ARE DESIGNED TO STAVE OFF THE NATURAL PROCESSES THAT HAPPEN TO A BODY AFTER DEATH
trainval/PRsopS7yTG8/50002 OLD CHURCHES AND INDUSTRIAL WAREHOUSES CAN BE CONVERTED INTO PLACES WHERE WE CREATE
trainval/PRsopS7yTG8/50003 WE WANT TO HELP INDIVIDUALS ORGANIZATIONS AND DOWN THE ROAD MUNICIPALITIES DESIGN AND BUILD
trainval/PS2h8hSFphs/50001 AND YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/PS6vDLq64gE/50001 WE CAN'T BELIEVE HOW PREVALENT LYING IS
trainval/PS6vDLq64gE/50002 WE'RE ESSENTIALLY AGAINST LYING
trainval/PS6vDLq64gE/50004 WE ALL CHATTER WITH OUR FINGERTIPS
trainval/PS6vDLq64gE/50005 THEY'RE GOING TO BE ENTHUSIASTIC
trainval/PS6vDLq64gE/50006 WE TELL VERY CONVINCING STORIES WE SLIGHTLY SHRUG OUR SHOULDERS
trainval/PS6vDLq64gE/50007 HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A DEAD GIVEAWAY FOR ANY LIESPOTTER THAT KNOWS THAT QUALIFYING LANGUAGE AS IT'S CALLED QUALIFYING LANGUAGE LIKE THAT
trainval/PS6vDLq64gE/50008 NOW HERE'S THE DEAL
trainval/pSCefSAYqaA/50001 WHEN THEY GATHERED SOME HUNDRED CHILDREN INTO THIS SMALL LIBRARY THE LIBRARIAN INTRODUCED ME AS
trainval/pSCefSAYqaA/50002 WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING
trainval/pSCefSAYqaA/50003 BECAUSE THIS IS THE WAY THEY TRAFFIC IN STORY
trainval/pSCefSAYqaA/50004 THE IPHONE THE IBOOK THE IPAD
trainval/pSCefSAYqaA/50005 IT'S AT YOUTUBE
trainval/pSCefSAYqaA/50007 WHAT DID THIS MEAN
trainval/pSCefSAYqaA/50008 SO THEY BROUGHT ANOTHER ONE
trainval/pSCefSAYqaA/50009 THOUGHTS ARE LIKE THAT
trainval/pSCefSAYqaA/50010 I HAVE A STORY
trainval/PSggxpMY9q0/50001 SO I WOULD SAY THERE IS MORE TO INTERPRETING THAN MEETS THE EYE
trainval/PSggxpMY9q0/50002 BUT WE STILL HAVE MORE TO DEAL WITH
trainval/PSggxpMY9q0/50003 I MEAN WE HAVE TO START TRANSLATING
trainval/PSggxpMY9q0/50005 AND UNDERSTAND THEIR POINT OF VIEW
trainval/PSggxpMY9q0/50006 FIND OUT AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE ABOUT THE PERSON YOU ARE INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING
trainval/PSggxpMY9q0/50007 DO THE GOOGLE SEARCH
trainval/PSggxpMY9q0/50008 AND THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT
trainval/PsihkFWDt3Y/50001 WE CAN LOOK AND SEE HOW WELL THEY SELL THINGS AS A FUNCTION OF BEING A MEMBER OF A TEAM
trainval/PsihkFWDt3Y/50002 AND INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT HOW IT MADE THEM REALIZE THAT MONEY DOESN'T LEAD TO HAPPINESS EVERYONE STARTED SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT I'D DO IF I WON
trainval/PsihkFWDt3Y/50003 PEOPLE WHO SPENT MONEY ON OTHERS GOT HAPPIER PEOPLE WHO SPENT IT ON THEMSELVES NOTHING HAPPENED
trainval/PsihkFWDt3Y/50004 OF COURSE THESE ARE UNDERGRADUATES IN CANADA NOT THE WORLD'S MOST REPRESENTATIVE POPULATION
trainval/PsihkFWDt3Y/50005 MAYBE YOU HAVE SOMETHING IN MIND MAYBE NOT
trainval/PsihkFWDt3Y/50006 YOU AND I CAN GO ON AND BUY IT FOR THEM
trainval/PSXxEyYQc5g/50001 I NOTICED A TREND
trainval/PSXxEyYQc5g/50002 AND THEN HOW CAN YOU MARKET THIS APP TO THAT AUDIENCE
trainval/PtBKP4fVAvI/50001 WE ALL MOVE IN THIS KIND OF BOUNCY WAY WHEN WE RUN
trainval/PtBKP4fVAvI/50002 AND WE'VE MADE SOME ADVANCES SO FAR BUT THERE'S STILL A LONG WAY TO GO AND HOPEFULLY SOME OF YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE TO
trainval/ptIecdCZ3dg/50001 THIS IS UNLIKE THE REST OF THE DEVELOPED WORLD WHERE AS GEORGE BURNS QUIPPED HAPPINESS IS HAVING A LARGE LOVING
trainval/ptIecdCZ3dg/50002 IT'S A REMOTE MOUNTAINOUS ZONE A BLUE ZONE WHERE SUPER LONGEVITY IS COMMON TO BOTH
trainval/ptIecdCZ3dg/50003 WELL THE SHORT ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IS NO IT'S NOT THE SAME THING
trainval/ptIecdCZ3dg/50004 AND DOPAMINE IS GENERATED WHICH GIVES US A LITTLE HIGH AND IT KILLS PAIN
trainval/ptIecdCZ3dg/50005 THAT WAS THE MAGIC NUMBER
trainval/ptIecdCZ3dg/50006 THINK ABOUT IT
trainval/PTUcj45juXg/50001 SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE HEROES IN YOUR MYTHS DON'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE YOU
trainval/PTUcj45juXg/50002 JANE FOSTER SOMEONE WE ALREADY KNEW
trainval/PTUcj45juXg/50003 SO HOW DO WE MAKE IT CONTINUE
trainval/PTUcj45juXg/50004 WHAT CAN I DO
trainval/PUh5msG0rG8/50001 IT IS NOT LOST ON ME EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT I GET UP AND I WALK INTO MY
trainval/PUh5msG0rG8/50002 AND THEN MY PARENTS WERE THE SAME WAY
trainval/PUh5msG0rG8/50003 THEY DIDN'T GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE
trainval/PUh5msG0rG8/50004 BECAUSE IT IS THEIR HARD WORK THEIR COURAGE AND THAT DOOR WAS OPEN FOR THEM
trainval/PUh5msG0rG8/50005 AND HE WAS AN IRISH IMMIGRANT
trainval/PUh5msG0rG8/50006 I THINK HE HAD A WEALTH OF ABOUT 40 MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS A BILLION DOLLARS TODAY
trainval/PUh5msG0rG8/50007 WHERE DO THEY COME FROM
trainval/PUh5msG0rG8/50008 AND I AM SO AFRAID OF WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN MY FUTURE
trainval/PUh5msG0rG8/50009 I'M AFRAID THAT IT'S NOW GOING TO BE TAKEN AWAY
trainval/PUh5msG0rG8/50010 HER NAME WAS ANNA
trainval/PuroSL7O4eY/50001 WE USED TO RELY ON NEWS ORG SUCH AS THE AP AFP REUTERS
trainval/PuroSL7O4eY/50002 NOT THIS TIME
trainval/PuroSL7O4eY/50003 BECAUSE BARACK WON BY SUCH LAST MARGIN THAT IT DIDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE
trainval/pvBlSFVmoaw/50001 YOU KNOW THAT DOESN'T COUNT
trainval/pvBlSFVmoaw/50002 THE COOLEST THING IS THAT THE PLANT CAN COUNT
trainval/pvBlSFVmoaw/50003 ONE OF THE REASONS WHY COULD BE THAT IT SCARES AWAY INSECTS OR IT LOOKS LESS APPEALING TO HERBIVORES
trainval/pvBlSFVmoaw/50004 OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM EVOLVED BECAUSE IT IS ELECTRICAL
trainval/pvBlSFVmoaw/50006 IT GETS MOST OF ITS ENERGY FROM THE SUN
trainval/pvBlSFVmoaw/50007 IT'S JUST TRYING TO REPLACE SOME NUTRIENTS IN THE GROUND WITH FLIES
trainval/pvBlSFVmoaw/50008 AND THE THIRD THING IS IT ONLY OPENS THEN CLOSES THE TRAPS A HANDFUL OF TIMES UNTIL THAT TRAP
trainval/pvBlSFVmoaw/50009 YOU LEARNED THAT PLANTS COULD BE USED TO HELP TEACH NEUROSCIENCE AND BRING ALONG THE NEUROREVOLUTION
trainval/PVfd6fg7QsM/50001 I COULD DRAW
trainval/PVfd6fg7QsM/50003 SO YOU KNOW MERGING THE TWO PASSIONS
trainval/PVfd6fg7QsM/50004 YOU KNOW I WAS A REAL SCIENCE GEEK
trainval/PVfd6fg7QsM/50005 THIS IS REALLY COOL
trainval/PVfd6fg7QsM/50006 NOBODY HAD EVER LOOKED INSIDE THE WRECK
trainval/PVfd6fg7QsM/50007 WE BARELY BREAK EVEN
trainval/PVfd6fg7QsM/50008 THERE IS NO FAME IN IT
trainval/PVfd6fg7QsM/50009 YOU KNOW WHERE IT WAS HIGHLY TECHNICAL AND IT REQUIRED ENORMOUS PLANNING
trainval/pVQdpofMhwU/50001 I'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT
trainval/pVQdpofMhwU/50002 SOMEWHERE ALONG MY JOURNEY AS AN EDUCATOR I HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT
trainval/pVQdpofMhwU/50003 AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME IT IS NON NEGOTIABLE
trainval/pVQdpofMhwU/50005 WE'VE SEEN THE NUMEROUS TED TALKS ON VULNERABILITY WE'VE BEEN TO A CONFERENCE LISTENED TO A PODCAST READ A BOOK
trainval/pVQdpofMhwU/50006 AND WHAT HAPPENS AFTER
trainval/pVQdpofMhwU/50007 I HOPE YOU JOIN THE MOVEMENT
trainval/PVXQUItNEDQ/50001 WE CAN SEE YOUR BRAIN CREATE YOUR THOUGHTS
trainval/PVXQUItNEDQ/50002 WE CAN SEE YOUR THOUGHTS CREATE YOUR BRAIN WHICH IS REALLY KEY TO HOW IT WORKS
trainval/PVXQUItNEDQ/50003 YOU'RE PROBABLY IN THE FRONTAL CORTEX AND YOU'LL HAVE MODULES THAT SAY THAT WAS IRONIC
trainval/PVXQUItNEDQ/50004 AND JENNINGS AND THE OTHER GUY DIDN'T GET THAT
trainval/PVXQUItNEDQ/50005 IT'S A PRETTY SOPHISTICATED EXAMPLE OF COMPUTERS ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDING HUMAN LANGUAGE AND IT ACTUALLY GOT ITS KNOWLEDGE BY READING
trainval/PVXQUItNEDQ/50006 WELL NEW RESEARCH JUST CAME OUT 13 SECONDS AGO THAT SHOWS A WHOLE NEW APPROACH TO THAT AND A NEW WAY TO TAKE GLUTATHIONE
trainval/PVXQUItNEDQ/50007 THAT MAY WORK IT MAY NOT BUT IF IT DOES IT WILL REMEMBER THAT AND HAVE A NEW BEHAVIOR AND THAT CAN ACTUALLY SPREAD VIRALLY
trainval/PVXQUItNEDQ/50008 I'LL BE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT IN THE CLOUD
trainval/PVXQUItNEDQ/50009 BUT THE FRONTAL CORTEX IS NOT REALLY QUALITATIVELY DIFFERENT
trainval/PVXQUItNEDQ/50010 IT'S A QUANTITATIVE EXPANSION OF NEOCORTEX BUT THAT ADDITIONAL QUANTITY OF THINKING WAS THE
trainval/PVXQUItNEDQ/50011 NO OTHER SPECIES HAS DONE THAT
trainval/PVzcGhZ8Aeg/50002 SO THE QUESTION TO ASK YOURSELF
trainval/PVzcGhZ8Aeg/50003 DO YOU HAVE REAL CONNECTIONS
trainval/PVzcGhZ8Aeg/50004 THAT WAS CONNECTIVITY FOR HIM
trainval/PVzcGhZ8Aeg/50005 COMMANDERS WOULD SOMETIMES FLY OVER A UNIT ON THE GROUND AND THEY'D TALK BY RADIO TO THEM AND THEY'D WATCH
trainval/PVzcGhZ8Aeg/50006 IF THEY LOOK LIKE THEY ARE ARGUING YOU HAVE A SENSE I KNOW THERE'S AN ARGUMENT GOING ON
trainval/PVzcGhZ8Aeg/50007 I HAVE FOUR BROTHERS TO WHOM I AM VERY CLOSE AND WE ALL CARRY CELLPHONES
trainval/PVzcGhZ8Aeg/50008 YOU KNOW THEY'RE BUILT OVER TIME
trainval/PVzcGhZ8Aeg/50009 THEY DON'T SUDDENLY HAPPEN
trainval/PVzcGhZ8Aeg/50010 YOU DON'T SEND SOMEBODY AN EMAIL AND HAVE THAT KIND OF CONNECTION
trainval/PVzcGhZ8Aeg/50011 USUALLY IT'S BUILT THROUGH SOMETHING YOU GO THROUGH
trainval/PVzcGhZ8Aeg/50012 VERY DIFFICULT SCHOOL SOME EXPERIENCE
trainval/pWaxi4H2xPU/50001 AND IT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST UNHAPPY YEAR OF MY LIFE
trainval/PwBgcjDVxxE/50001 IT'S AVAILABLE 24 7 FOR FREE AND PROFESSIONAL COUNSELORS ARE HAPPY TO HOOK PEOPLE UP WITH THE SERVICES THEY
trainval/PWhjzFwn9Js/50001 I WANT TO YOU TO MEET DIXIE
trainval/PWhjzFwn9Js/50002 SHE BELONGS TO MY FOUR YEAR OLD SON ROAN
trainval/PWhjzFwn9Js/50003 I HOPE I DIDN'T FAIL
trainval/pWrgvI4nyyg/50001 AS A PRACTICING DOCTOR MYSELF I'M CONSTANTLY REMINDED OF THE IMPORTANCE OF LISTENING
trainval/pWrgvI4nyyg/50002 YET WHAT I'D SEEN IN MADAGASCAR STAYED WITH ME LONG AFTER I RETURNED HOME
trainval/pWrgvI4nyyg/50003 THESE COMMUNITIES WERE SO REMOTE
trainval/pWrgvI4nyyg/50005 WE BECAME A CONSERVATION ORGANIZATION THAT DARED TO THINK DIFFERENTLY
trainval/pWrgvI4nyyg/50006 AND WERE WILLING TO RESPOND TO THE NEEDS THAT COMMUNITIES TOLD US ABOUT
trainval/pWrgvI4nyyg/50007 AND THIS APPEARS TO BE STRENGTHENING THEIR ENGAGEMENT IN MARINE CONSERVATION
trainval/pWrgvI4nyyg/50008 FOR THE FIRST TIME COUPLES ARE ABLE TO PLAN THEIR FAMILIES
trainval/pX8zZdLw7cs/50001 A DESIGNER THINKS ABOUT THE END USER OF THE PRODUCT
trainval/pX8zZdLw7cs/50002 THAT HUMAN BEING ON THE OTHER END OF THE DESIGN PROCESS IS EVERYTHING
trainval/pX8zZdLw7cs/50004 FIRSTLY WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE STREETS THEMSELVES
trainval/pX8zZdLw7cs/50005 WHAT ARE STREETS
trainval/pX8zZdLw7cs/50006 BUT I'D LIKE TO PUT THE NEXT 15 MINUTES OR SO INTO PERSPECTIVE FOR YOU AND I'M GOING TO NEED YOUR HELP FOR THAT
trainval/pX8zZdLw7cs/50007 NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE THIS PERCEPTION THAT STREETS ARE THE EXCLUSIVE DOMAIN OF AUTOMOBILES
trainval/pX8zZdLw7cs/50008 SERIOUSLY CITIES AROUND THE WORLD CAN'T PUT IN A SIMPLE DECENT CYCLE TRACK OR WIDEN THE SIDEWALKS TRAFFIC CALM A
trainval/pX8zZdLw7cs/50009 IT'S THE PEOPLE WHO DEFINE THE CITY
trainval/pX8zZdLw7cs/50010 SHOULDN'T WE STUDY THEIR BEHAVIOR THEIR PATTERNS THEIR MOVEMENTS THEIR DESIRES THEIR NEEDS IN ORDER TO FIGURE
trainval/pX8zZdLw7cs/50011 IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT WORKED FOR ABOUT 7000 YEARS
trainval/pX8zZdLw7cs/50012 I THINK THERE'S A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE IT'S GOING TO WORK AGAIN
trainval/pX8zZdLw7cs/50013 ONE IS BASIC HUMAN OBSERVATION SOMETHING WE ALL SHARE
trainval/pX8zZdLw7cs/50014 THAT'S HOW DESIGNING CITIES FOR PEOPLE SHOULD BE
trainval/pX8zZdLw7cs/50015 IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW HILLY HOW HOT HOW COLD CITIZEN CYCLISTS WILL RIDE SEDUCED BY THE GOOD DESIGN THE
trainval/pX8zZdLw7cs/50016 GOOD DESIGN CAN ALSO IMPROVE HUMAN BEHAVIOR
trainval/pX8zZdLw7cs/50017 PHYSIO SOCIO PSHYCO IDEAL PLEASURE IN EVERYTHING THEY DO
trainval/pX8zZdLw7cs/50018 IN COPENHAGEN IN THE MORNING RUSH HOUR WHEN A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE RIDE THEIR BIKES TO WORK IT'S DIFFERENT
trainval/pX8zZdLw7cs/50019 WHY ARE CARS SILLY
trainval/pX8zZdLw7cs/50020 LULU SOPHIA HAS A BROTHER HIS NAME'S FELIX HE'S 10
trainval/pX8zZdLw7cs/50021 THE GLASS ROOFS WERE A FUNNY IDEA BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/pX8zZdLw7cs/50022 AS WE SPEAK THERE ARE CITIES IN THE NETHERLANDS WHO ARE INSTALLING RAIN SENSORS ON THEIR BICYCLE TRAFFIC LIGHTS SO THAT WHEN IT RAINS
trainval/pX8zZdLw7cs/50023 SIMPLE RATIONAL LOGICAL
trainval/PXBjQ7bc6PY/50001 I WENT TO SOUTHERN AFRICA
trainval/PXHczjOg06w/50001 IT'S NOT JUST REPULSION
trainval/PXMJobWlXks/50002 THIS IS A CATASTROPHE WAITING TO HAPPEN AGAIN
trainval/PXMJobWlXks/50003 NOW AS ARCHITECTS WE'RE TRAINED TO SOLVE PROBLEMS
trainval/PXMJobWlXks/50004 THE DUNES HERE MOVE SOUTHWARD AT A PACE OF AROUND 600 METERS A YEAR
trainval/pxr2GRJ6tjc/50001 YOU DON'T VACCINATE A FEW CHILDREN
trainval/pY6ulSP70HY/50001 COMPUTERS HAVE CHANGED THE LIVES OF US ALL IN THIS ROOM AND AROUND THE WORLD BUT I THINK THEY HAVE CHANGED THE LIVES OF WE
trainval/pY6ulSP70HY/50002 I LOVE STORIES I WANT TO READ
trainval/pY6ulSP70HY/50003 IT HAD A SPEECH SYNTHESISER
trainval/pY6ulSP70HY/50004 AND HIS MACHINE WHICH WAS AS BIG AS WASHING MACHINE WAS LAUNCHED ON THE 13TH OF JANUARY
trainval/pY6ulSP70HY/50005 FOR THE FIRST TIME I COULD READ WHAT I WANTED TO READ BY PUTTING A BOOK ON THE SCANNER
trainval/pY6ulSP70HY/50006 ONE IS ANOTHER AMERICAN INVENTOR TED HENTER
trainval/pY6ulSP70HY/50007 I DID NOT HAVE TO BE NICE TO PEOPLE
trainval/pY6ulSP70HY/50008 I SLOWED IT DOWN FOR YOU
trainval/pY6ulSP70HY/50009 I AM GOING TO ASK THAT WE PLAY IT AT THE SPEED I READ IT
trainval/pY6ulSP70HY/50010 CAN YOU PLAY IT THAT ONE
trainval/pY6ulSP70HY/50011 NOW THERE ARE STILL BARRIERS IN FRONT OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
trainval/pY6ulSP70HY/50012 MANY WEBSITES WE CANNOT READ USING JAWS AND THE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES
trainval/pY6ulSP70HY/50013 WEBSITES ARE OFTEN VERY VISUAL AND THERE ARE ALL THESE SORTS OF GRAPHS THAT ARE NOT LABELLED AND BUTTONS THAT ARE NOT LABELLED
trainval/pY6ulSP70HY/50014 THERE ARE OTHER BARRIERS BROUGHT ABOUT BY OUR LAWS
trainval/pY6ulSP70HY/50015 WELL BECAUSE WE CANNOT TRANSPORT BOOKS ACROSS BORDERS THERE HAD TO BE SEPARATE VERSIONS READ IN ALL THE
trainval/pY6ulSP70HY/50016 AND THAT IS WHY NEXT MONTH IN MOROCCO A MEETING IS TAKING PLACE BETWEEN ALL THE COUNTRIES
trainval/pY6ulSP70HY/50017 IT IS SOMETHING THAT A GROUP OF COUNTRIES AND THE WORLD BLIND UNION ARE ADVOCATING
trainval/pY6ulSP70HY/50018 SO THAT IF BOOKS ARE AVAILABLE UNDER A COPYRIGHT EXCEPTION AND THE OTHER COUNTRY HAS A COPYRIGHT EXCEPTION WE CAN TRANSPORT
trainval/pY6ulSP70HY/50019 I WANT THAT TO HAPPEN
trainval/pY6ulSP70HY/50020 WHETHER IT BE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SIDNEY LAW SCHOOL WHERE I SERVED A TERM AS DEAN OR NOW AS I
trainval/pY6ulSP70HY/50021 I WONDER WHAT THE FUTURE WILL HOLD
trainval/PY9DcIMGxMs/50001 THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
trainval/PY9DcIMGxMs/50002 THERE ARE LOADS OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM YOU MAY NOT REALIZE IT YOU'VE TAKEN QUITE A LOT OF HEROIN
trainval/PY9DcIMGxMs/50003 THEY'RE REALLY SIMPLE
trainval/PY9DcIMGxMs/50004 THAT'S HOW WE THINK IT WORKS
trainval/PY9DcIMGxMs/50006 CRUCIALLY THEY'VE GOT LOADS OF FRIENDS
trainval/PY9DcIMGxMs/50007 THEY CAN HAVE LOADS OF SEX
trainval/PY9DcIMGxMs/50008 NONE OF THEM EVER OVERDOSE
trainval/PY9DcIMGxMs/50009 LOOKING AT THIS THERE WAS ANOTHER PROFESSOR CALLED PETER COHEN IN THE NETHERLANDS WHO SAID MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T EVEN CALL IT ADDICTION
trainval/PY9DcIMGxMs/50010 THAT'S WHAT WE WANT AS HUMAN BEINGS
trainval/PY9DcIMGxMs/50011 FORGET THE DRUG WAR
trainval/PY9DcIMGxMs/50012 IT'S BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT BONDS AND CONNECTIONS THAT YOU WANT TO BE PRESENT FOR
trainval/PY9DcIMGxMs/50013 YOU'VE GOT WORK YOU LOVE
trainval/PY9DcIMGxMs/50015 BUT THE BIGGEST THING THEY DID WAS THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE DO A MASSIVE PROGRAM OF JOB CREATION FOR ADDICTS
trainval/PY9DcIMGxMs/50016 SO SAY YOU USED TO BE A MECHANIC
trainval/PY9DcIMGxMs/50017 IT'LL BE 15 YEARS THIS YEAR SINCE THAT EXPERIMENT BEGAN AND THE RESULTS ARE IN
trainval/PY9DcIMGxMs/50018 WE PUNISH THEM
trainval/PY9DcIMGxMs/50019 IT WON'T BE YOUR TWITTER FOLLOWERS WHO COME TO SIT WITH YOU
trainval/PY9DcIMGxMs/50020 WE SHAME THEM
trainval/PY9DcIMGxMs/50021 I WANTED TO KNOW HOW TO HELP THE PEOPLE I LOVE
trainval/PY9DcIMGxMs/50022 EVERYONE HAS A BIT OF THEM THAT LOOKS AT AN ADDICT AND THINKS I WISH SOMEONE WOULD JUST STOP YOU
trainval/PY9DcIMGxMs/50023 WE GIVE THEM CRIMINAL RECORDS
trainval/PYjWLqEScfE/50001 AND WE SEE THIS ALL AROUND US
trainval/PYjWLqEScfE/50002 THEN YOU DECIDE YOU WOULDN'T MIND A FEW MORE
trainval/PYjWLqEScfE/50003 AND SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO NOW IS TO PREPARE FOR THAT FUTURE BY DEVELOPING TOOLS AND ATTITUDES THAT
trainval/PYjWLqEScfE/50004 WHAT FOOD CAN WE EAT
trainval/PyS1o4sX1hk/50001 CAN WE START TO FIGURE OUT HOW DOES THE COUNTRY FEEL TODAY
trainval/PyS1o4sX1hk/50002 HOW DOES COLORADO FEEL TODAY
trainval/PyS1o4sX1hk/50003 OR ISN'T THAT JUST POLLING
trainval/PyS1o4sX1hk/50005 WELL WHEN TWITTER STARTED THAT WAS A HUGE PROBLEM RIGHT
trainval/PyS1o4sX1hk/50006 IT TURNS OUT WHEN WE'RE BUMMED OUT WE BUY THINGS THAT MAKE US FEEL BETTER
trainval/PyS1o4sX1hk/50007 COUCHES AND REFRIGERATORS AND NEW CARS
trainval/PyS1o4sX1hk/50008 YOU WANT TO MANAGE YOUR SUPPLY CHAIN YOU'RE THE MANAGER AT A STORE AND YOU WANT TO CHANGE WHAT PROMOTIONS YOU HAVE
trainval/PyS1o4sX1hk/50009 MEASURE THE SENTIMENT OF THOSE TWEETS
trainval/PYSkd46RfVE/50001 DID THEY EAT FISH AND CHIPS
trainval/PYSkd46RfVE/50002 HE SAID MY JOB IS TO PROVE DR
trainval/PYSkd46RfVE/50003 HE SAW HIS JOB AS CREATING CONFLICT AROUND HER THEORIES
trainval/PYSkd46RfVE/50004 AND SHE WAS UNUSUAL BECAUSE SHE WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN A NEW SCIENCE THE EMERGING FIELD OF
trainval/PYSkd46RfVE/50005 HE WAS AFRAID OF DOING DAMAGE TO THE PATIENTS HE WAS TRYING TO HELP
trainval/PYSkd46RfVE/50006 AND IT MEANS THAT PEOPLE LIKE MANY OF US WHO HAVE RUN ORGANIZATIONS AND GONE OUT OF OUR WAY TO
trainval/pysNMB033co/50001 AND THEN I REMEMBER MY HIGH SCHOOL CHEMISTRY TEACHER WITH REALLY LONG SOCKS AT THE BLACKBOARD DRAWING DIAGRAMS OF
trainval/pysNMB033co/50002 THAT'S THE HARD STUFF THAT TREES ARE MADE OF
trainval/pysNMB033co/50003 SO TREES EFFECTIVELY INVENT THEIR OWN TRUNKS AT THIS TIME AND THEY GET REALLY BIG BIGGER AND BIGGER AND PEPPER
trainval/pysNMB033co/50004 EIGHTY FIVE TO 95 PERCENT OF SPECIES AT THIS TIME DIE OUT AND SIMULTANEOUS TO THAT IS A
trainval/pysNMB033co/50005 WHEN WE THINK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE WE PROBABLY DON'T THINK ABOUT GIANT
trainval/pysNMB033co/50006 WE THINK ABOUT PIE CHARTS AND COLUMN GRAPHS AND ENDLESS POLITICIANS TALKING TO SCIENTISTS WEARING
trainval/pysNMB033co/50007 NOW THIS AIR COMES WITH AN ETHICAL DIMENSION AS WELL
trainval/pysNMB033co/50008 IT MAY NOT SUPPORT THE KIND OF LIFE THAT WE'D RECOGNIZE BUT IT WILL SUPPORT SOMETHING
trainval/pyWrZceeKNE/50001 AND SO I WANT TO FOLLOW MY OWN DARN ADVICE
trainval/pz1TDXKSTHc/50001 AND FLUORESCENT LABELS WORK BEST FOR THESE
trainval/pz1TDXKSTHc/50002 SO YOU WANT TO STUDY EACH VIRUS ONE AT A TIME
trainval/pz1TDXKSTHc/50003 AND THESE THINGS ARE REALLY SMALL
trainval/pz1TDXKSTHc/50004 BUT NOW I WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS PROBLEM
trainval/pz1TDXKSTHc/50005 SO EVEN THOUGH WE CAN STILL DO QUITE A LOT AND LEARN A LOT OF INFORMATION FROM THESE BLURRY PIXELATED
trainval/pz1TDXKSTHc/50006 SO IN FACT WE WORK WITH VERY SPECIAL FLUORESCENT LABELS THAT WE CAN BY EXCITING THEM WITH
trainval/pz1TDXKSTHc/50007 SO WE ARE ACTUALLY FOLLOWING THE MOTION OF THE VIRUS INSIDE THE CELL
trainval/pz1TDXKSTHc/50008 THIS WAS POPULAR IN THE 1800'S AND REALLY TALENTED PAINTERS COULD PAINT THESE
trainval/pz1TDXKSTHc/50009 AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE DOING WE ARE PUTTING TOGETHER DOTS
trainval/pz1TDXKSTHc/50010 AND I HOPE I WAS ABLE TO SHOW YOU THAT WE ARE GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THAT DREAM
trainval/Pzd7ReqiQnE/50001 AND RARER STILL WHEN ACCOMPANIED AS IN MY CASE BY SELF
trainval/Pzd7ReqiQnE/50002 I CAN SEE IT IN THEIR EYES
trainval/Pzd7ReqiQnE/50003 THEY WANT TO ASK ME SOMETHING
trainval/Pzd7ReqiQnE/50004 I'M ASSUMING THERE ARE NOT MANY PEOPLE HERE WHO SPEAK ICELANDIC
trainval/pzN4WGPC4kc/50001 NAVAL INTELLIGENCE PROJECT
trainval/pzN4WGPC4kc/50002 BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE DRUGS YOU HAVE A REASONABLY GOOD
trainval/pzN4WGPC4kc/50003 ANOTHER CALLED TWISTER AND SO ON AND SO ON
trainval/pZni9Kx9Jfw/50001 THEY ONLY HAD ISLAMIC EDUCATION VERY LITTLE OF IT
trainval/PzSw6OsEP9Q/50001 AND IT MISSES THE POINT
trainval/PzSw6OsEP9Q/50002 AND IT'S ONE OF THE BEST CO OP STORIES AND THOSE ENTITIES AND CO OP BUSINESSES STILL EXIST TODAY
trainval/PzSw6OsEP9Q/50003 SO BACK TO VALUES
trainval/PzSw6OsEP9Q/50004 THIS IS A TERM THAT WE COINED IN OUR LITTLE CO OP AND WE'RE A LITTLE DIFFERENT
trainval/PzSw6OsEP9Q/50005 AND SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY MEMBERS YET
trainval/PzSw6OsEP9Q/50006 BUT ANYHOW WE'RE REALLY TRYING HARD TO CAPTURE THESE VALUES
trainval/PzSw6OsEP9Q/50007 AND IT'S THIS CO OPINESS THAT IS HOW WE THINK OUR CO OP IS GOING TO WORK IN HEALTH INSURANCE
trainval/PzSw6OsEP9Q/50008 OR IT CAN BE WE ASK EVERYONE WHO SIGNS UP TO COMMIT TO
trainval/PzSw6OsEP9Q/50009 WE MIGHT EVEN GET A TEXT MESSAGE IF OUR DOCTOR WAS RUNNING LATE BECAUSE HE HAD TO GO INTO SURGERY SO THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO SIT THERE
trainval/PzSw6OsEP9Q/50010 AND THAT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS WHY PEOPLE CAN'T GET HEALTH INSURANCE TODAY IS BECAUSE IT'S SO HARD TO AFFORD
trainval/PzSw6OsEP9Q/50011 I MEAN IMAGINE A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT WAS CREATED FOR CONSUMERS
trainval/PzyAP4zLb6w/50001 IT'S A WEEKLY TURNAROUND OF PRODUCTION
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50002 IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE RESULT BY CHANGING THE BEHAVIOUR THERE ARE MULTIPLE LEVELS
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50003 SO OVERNIGHT HE'D LOST TEN SHOTS ON THE SAME HOLE
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50004 I THINK IT WAS IN THE US MASTERS SERGIO PLAYED BRILLIANTLY ALL WEEK
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50005 HE GOT TO THE SUNDAY AND SOMETHING WENT WRONG HE WAS LEADING THE FIELD BY SIX SHOTS AND ON THE
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50006 SO THAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING TO ME
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50007 I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT YOU AND HOW YOU CAN BE BRILLIANT EVERY SINGLE DAY
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50008 AS THOUGH IT'S A COMPLETE MYSTERY WHY THESE THINGS HAPPEN
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50010 SO I'M SHOUTING AT THE TELEVISION
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50011 ACTUALLY I KNOW WHY THAT HAPPENED AND I KNOW WHY SERGIO GARCIA
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50012 WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BIT OF LIVE DEMONSTRATION OF SOMETHING
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50013 SO A BIG ASK
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50014 DON'T KNOW WHY I'M LOOKING AT SIMON WHEN I SAY THAT
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50015 MOST PERFORMANCE APPRAISALS IN INDUSTRY FOCUS ON WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50016 I SPENT THE LAST 15 YEARS WORKING WITH SOME OF THE BEST CEOS AND EXECUTIVES AROUND THE WORLD
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50017 YOU GO TO SEE YOUR BOSS AND HE SAID OH I'VE GOT SOME 360 DATA
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50018 IT WILL ONLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IF THE LEADERS STOOD OVER THAT EMPLOYEE CRACKING THE WHIP AND MAKING SURE THEY DO
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50019 I KNOW I OUGHT TO MAKE ANOTHER THOUSAND CALLS TO A THOUSAND CUSTOMERS BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50020 YOU'VE GOT TO GET TO GRIPS WITH WHAT'S ON THE INSIDE OF INDIVIDUALS
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50021 WHY WOULD HE
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50022 OR IF HE THINKS WHAT I'M SAYING IS RUBBISH HE WON'T DO IT
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50023 I WAS SAT ON THE COUCH AT HOME WATCHING THE TV ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50024 BUT OUR VIEW IS IF YOU DON'T GET TO GRIPS AND START TO ASK SOME MORE DETAILED QUESTIONS YOU WON'T GET A SUSTAINABLE CHANGE IN THE
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50025 SO YOU'VE GOT TO GET TO GRIPS WITH HOW PEOPLE THINK ABOUT YOU ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT THE WORLD
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50026 BUT EVEN IF YOU DID IT'S NOT ENOUGH
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50028 IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THEIR THINKING YOU HAVE TO CHANGE HOW THEY FEEL
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50030 A VERY GOOD GOLFER SERGIO GARCIA WAS PLAYING AND HE'D BEEN BRILLIANT ALL WEEK
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50032 IT'S COMING INTO YOUR BRAIN TELL YOUR BRAIN WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR GUT RIGHT
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50033 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50034 SOME OF YOU ARE GETTING CONTRACTIONS AROUND THAT CUPCAKE SO YOU'VE GOT PRESSURE WAVES BEING CREATED TELLING YOUR BRAIN ABOUT WHAT'S
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50035 WE'VE ALL GOT EMOTIONS EVERY SECOND OF EVERY DAY
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50036 THERE IS AN ENERGETIC STATE GOING THROUGH US
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50037 BUT WE MAY NOT ALL HAVE FEELINGS
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50038 THAT'S WHERE THE PROBLEM IS
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50039 THE ENERGY MAY BE THERE BUT WE JUST DON'T FEEL IT
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50040 WE LOOK AT THE HEART RATE IT'S FAST
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50041 WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE MOUTH
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50042 THE MOUTH'S DRY
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50043 AND YOU SAY ALRIGHT
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50044 YOU'RE JUST THINKING WHAT YOU'RE THINKING AND DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50045 IF YOU CAN GET CONTROL OVER THE WHOLE THING YOU CAN CRANK OUT YOUR A GAME EVERY SINGLE DAY
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50047 GIVEN SO MANY DIFFERENT SIGNALS WHERE ARE WE GOING TO START
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50049 IF WE LOOK AT YOUR HEART RATE OVER TIME WE'LL SEE THAT YOUR HEART RATE WILL VARY UP AND DOWN
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50051 SO SOME OF YOU HAD THE CUPCAKE AT THE BREAK AND YOU'LL BE GETTING A SIGNAL FROM YOUR GUT SAYING OH SUGAR
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50052 DID YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50053 THEY DON'T CARE
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50054 SO WE CAN'T SELL THEM ON THAT
trainval/q06YIWCR2Js/50055 IF WE MEASURE HRV FOR 24 HOURS IT CAN TELL YOU HOW MUCH ENERGY YOU'VE GOT WHICH IS INTERESTING TO LEADERS BECAUSE LEADERS NEED
trainval/Q0lARjgVnIU/50002 THE FOLLOWING DAY WOMEN DIDN'T GO TO WORK
trainval/Q0lARjgVnIU/50003 AND 100 000 OF THEM POURED INTO THE STREETS OF TEHRAN MARCHING
trainval/Q0lARjgVnIU/50004 OF COURSE WE NEED TO CONDEMN THE COMPULSORY VEILING OF WOMEN WHEREVER IT
trainval/Q0lARjgVnIU/50005 BUT WHERE WOMEN DO HAVE A CHOICE WE NEED TO RESPECT THAT THEY WILL EXERCISE THAT
trainval/Q0lARjgVnIU/50006 FOR MANY MUSLIM WOMEN THE HIJAB IS AN INTERNAL MESSAGE TO THEMSELVES AND MORE
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50001 BUT IT ISN'T LONG BEFORE OUR DAUGHTERS GO TO SCHOOL AND THEY OPEN UP THEIR SOCIAL STUDIES BOOKS
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50002 WE ELECTED BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50003 YOU'VE SEEN THESE PORTRAITS
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50004 YOU'VE SEEN THESE
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50005 THE COLLEGE PROFESSOR MY FAVORITE USUALLY SLIGHTLY GRAYING VERY DIGNIFIED
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50006 BUT WE KNOW THAT NOT ALL POLICE OFFICERS ARE OVERWEIGHT
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50007 MY SISTER TERRY FOR EXAMPLE IS ONE OF THE FITTEST PEOPLE I KNOW
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50008 SHE WORKED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AS A POLICE OFFICER
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50009 WELL I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50010 AND SHE WAS STEPPING DOWN AS SECRETARY OF STATE AND BARBARA WALTERS ASKED HER SOME REALLY GREAT QUESTIONS
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50011 THINGS LIKE WHAT PART OF THE WORLD WORRIES YOU THE MOST
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50012 WOMEN IN THE PUBLIC LIGHT
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50013 THERE'S A LINE OF RESEARCH CALLED GENDER PIPELINE RESEARCH AND IT SAYS THIS
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50014 AND ALTHOUGH I THINK THAT'S TRUE I ALSO THINK THAT IF EVERY SINGLE TIME A WOMAN ENTERS THE PIPELINE SHE
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50015 BUT WHEN WE GET INTO THE VOTING BOOTH WE SAY NO
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50016 AND IT FOUND THAT 26 OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE ANGRY OR UPSET WITH
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50017 SHE ASKED ME ABOUT MY RESEARCH
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50018 AND AS SHE LEFT SHE SMILED AT ME WARMLY AND SHE SAID YOU KNOW I GIVE YOU A LOT OF CREDIT FOR WHAT YOU'RE
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50019 BUT I JUST DON'T THINK A WOMAN IS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT IN MY LIFETIME
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50020 MY HEART SANK BECAUSE I THOUGHT IF YOU DON'T THINK A WOMAN IS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT IN YOUR LIFETIME MAYBE YOU'RE
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50021 YOU'RE LEANING IN
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50022 YOU WOULDN'T WANT YOUR DAUGHTERS TREATED THAT WAY
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50023 WE HAVE TO WRITE LETTERS TO THE EDITORS
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50024 WE HAVE TO CALL OUT THIS TREATMENT BY EXPOSING THIS MEDIA FOR WHAT IT IS
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50025 REPORT THESE INSTANCES OF SEXIST MEDIA TO PLACES LIKE THE NAME IT CHANGE IT CAMPAIGN SPONSORED
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50026 SO WHEN WILL WE HAVE A WOMAN PRESIDENT
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50027 BECAUSE WHEN WE DO SHE AND WE WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50028 WE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE ENGAGED IN POWERFUL IMAGINATION OF BREAKING
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50029 AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50030 STOP BUYING THOSE MAGAZINES THAT MARGINALIZE WOMEN
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50031 YOU WOULDN'T WANT YOUR MOTHER SPOKEN LIKE THAT ABOUT
trainval/Q0Uo05JoZQo/50032 YOU WOULDN'T WANT YOURSELF SPOKEN LIKE THAT ABOUT
trainval/q16f8km11Ms/50001 GET COMFORTABLE WITH BEING UNCOMFORTABLE
trainval/q16f8km11Ms/50002 I WENT FROM DRIVING ON THE LEFT SIDE TO DRIVING ON THE RIGHT
trainval/q16f8km11Ms/50003 I'M GOING TO TELL YOU MY STORY
trainval/q1pKLVX3VSA/50002 THIS IS A MATTER OF ECONOMIC BENEFIT THIS CAN REALLY CHANGE THE WAY WE WORK LIVE AND PLAY WHY WOULD WE NOT DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
trainval/q1sk47FLAmg/50001 YOU SEE WE'VE BEEN DEVELOPING ROBOTIC RACE CARS CARS THAT CAN ACTUALLY PUSH THEMSELVES TO THE
trainval/q1sk47FLAmg/50002 WELL THERE'S TWO REALLY GOOD REASONS FOR THIS
trainval/q1sk47FLAmg/50003 YOU WERE TIRED BUT YOU FELT YOU COULD DRIVE A FEW MORE MILES
trainval/q1sk47FLAmg/50004 BUT IN FACT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THESE AUTONOMOUS CARS
trainval/q1sk47FLAmg/50005 THEY'RE ABLE TO GO OUT AND CONSISTENTLY DO THIS PUSHING THE CAR TO THE LIMITS EVERY SINGLE
trainval/q1sk47FLAmg/50006 OR MAYBE YOUR MIND WAS JUST ENTIRELY ELSEWHERE
trainval/q1sk47FLAmg/50007 NOW WE CAN MEASURE THIS AND WE CAN LOOK AT THE RELATIVE POWER BETWEEN THE THETA WAVES AND THE ALPHA WAVES
trainval/q1sk47FLAmg/50008 NOW WE WANTED TO SEE IF WE COULD ACTUALLY RECORD THIS ON THE TRACK SO WE HEADED DOWN SOUTH TO LAGUNA SECA
trainval/q1sk47FLAmg/50009 NOW THE CORKSCREW IS A CHICANE FOLLOWED BY A QUICK RIGHT HANDED TURN AS THE ROAD DROPS THREE STORIES
trainval/q1sk47FLAmg/50010 AND JOHN'S GOING TO GO INTO THAT CORNER AND THE REAR END OF THE CAR IS GOING TO BEGIN TO SLIDE OUT
trainval/q1sk47FLAmg/50011 I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU AROUND NOW TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRACK
trainval/q2k2Xbfuy1I/50001 AND THIRDLY HOW CAN WE IMPROVE PEOPLE'S LIVES ESPECIALLY THOSE OF THE ELDERLY AND THE DISABLED
trainval/q2k2Xbfuy1I/50002 AND THIS IS REALLY WHERE SMART MOBILITY PLAYS A HUGE ROLE
trainval/q2k2Xbfuy1I/50003 THIS IS REALLY JUST THE BEGINNING NOW WE NEED TO APPLY THE HUMAN INTELLIGENCE MAKE THE
trainval/q2k2Xbfuy1I/50004 EVERY COMPANY HAS THEIR OWN PHILOSOPHY
trainval/q2k2Xbfuy1I/50005 WE TAKE ALL OF THE DATA FROM ALL THOSE SENSORS AND CREATE THE PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW THE CARS TO DRIVE THEMSELVES
trainval/q2k2Xbfuy1I/50006 WE REALLY TOOK A LOOK AT WHERE WE WANT TO BE IN 2050 AND WE HIGHLIGHTED AREAS THAT WE
trainval/q2k2Xbfuy1I/50007 YOU CAN HARDLY GET AROUND
trainval/q319HSSLs9Q/50001 SO WHAT IS THE BEST THING OF LIFE
trainval/q319HSSLs9Q/50003 I HAVE A DRUG DEVELOPER
trainval/q319HSSLs9Q/50004 I THINK YOU HAVE A CHEMISTRY LAB
trainval/q319HSSLs9Q/50005 CAN WE USE IT TO MAKE A DRUG
trainval/q319HSSLs9Q/50006 SO WE PUT HIM IN THE LAB AND HE COULD START TO MAKE DRUGS
trainval/q319HSSLs9Q/50007 THE CANCER IS GONE
trainval/q319HSSLs9Q/50008 WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT
trainval/q319HSSLs9Q/50009 THIS WAY THE PUBLIC FOUNDATION IS OWNED BY NOBODY
trainval/q319HSSLs9Q/50010 WE WON'T GET ANY HELP FROM THE BIG PHARMAS
trainval/q319HSSLs9Q/50011 WE CAN REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE
trainval/q43uXdOKPD8/50002 THEY HAVE MONEY AND POWER
trainval/q43uXdOKPD8/50004 AFTER A FIRE WHAT ARE YOU PROPOSING
trainval/q43uXdOKPD8/50005 SO I REMEMBER IT WAS SO DISAPPOINTING
trainval/q43uXdOKPD8/50006 IN ONE MONTH WE COMPLETED NINE CLASSROOMS OVER 500 SQUARE METERS
trainval/q43uXdOKPD8/50007 IT'S STILL USED EVEN AFTER THE CURRENT EARTHQUAKE IN CHINA
trainval/q49LtMyXK7Q/50001 THE GOAL WAS TO DEVELOP A PRICE GUIDE A REAL DATA DRIVEN VIEW OF THE MARKET
trainval/q49LtMyXK7Q/50002 SOMEONE IS MAKING THE RULES
trainval/q49LtMyXK7Q/50003 BY LAST COUNT THERE WERE 48 DIFFERENT ONLINE MARKETS THAT I KNOW OF
trainval/q4TJEASZRys/50001 WHAT AM I DOING
trainval/q4TJEASZRys/50002 WHAT'S THE MEANING OF LIFE
trainval/q4TJEASZRys/50003 IN FACT THE DALAI LAMA HAVE ANY OF YOU HEARD OF HIM
trainval/Q80MfH7xPPE/50001 I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE DONE THOSE
trainval/Q80MfH7xPPE/50002 A LOT OF COMPANIES USE THESE FOR RECRUITMENT
trainval/Q80MfH7xPPE/50003 AND I HAVE TO SAY NOW I'LL SAY IT A BIT LATER BUT I'M NOT CHALLENGING THIS JUST BECAUSE I'M WEIRD THE CHALLENGE ACTUALLY
trainval/Q80MfH7xPPE/50004 WE HAVE KNOWLEDGE
trainval/Q80MfH7xPPE/50005 WE HAVE SENSATIONS AND EXPERIENCES AS WELL
trainval/Q80MfH7xPPE/50006 WELL MAYBE NOT
trainval/Q80MfH7xPPE/50007 WHAT IS THERE THEN
trainval/Q80MfH7xPPE/50008 BUT THERE'S ALSO A NARRATIVE A STORY WE TELL ABOUT OURSELVES THE EXPERIENCES WE HAVE WHEN WE REMEMBER PAST
trainval/Q80MfH7xPPE/50009 NOW THOSE PARTS ARE ALSO PHYSICAL PARTS OF COURSE BRAINS BODIES AND LEGS AND THINGS BUT THEY AREN'T SO IMPORTANT ACTUALLY
trainval/Q80MfH7xPPE/50010 IF YOU HAVE A HEART TRANSPLANT YOU'RE STILL THE SAME PERSON
trainval/Q80MfH7xPPE/50011 IN A WAY IT'S COMMON SENSE
trainval/Q80MfH7xPPE/50013 WE SAY THE WATCH HAS A FACE AND HANDS AND A MECHANISM AND A BATTERY
trainval/Q80MfH7xPPE/50014 NOW YOU MIGHT THINK THIS IS A WORRYING IDEA
trainval/Q80MfH7xPPE/50015 DOES THAT MEAN THAT REALLY THE SELF IS AN ILLUSION
trainval/Q80MfH7xPPE/50016 THE FACT THAT WE ARE IN SOME WAYS JUST THIS VERY VERY COMPLEX COLLECTION ORDERED
trainval/Q80MfH7xPPE/50017 YOU'RE BORN WITH AN ESSENCE THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE UNTIL YOU DIE IF YOU
trainval/Q80MfH7xPPE/50018 NOW WE'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL HERE RIGHT
trainval/Q80MfH7xPPE/50019 IF YOU WATCH THE X FACTOR TOO MUCH YOU MIGHT BUY INTO THIS IDEA THAT WE CAN ALL BE WHATEVER WE WANT TO BE
trainval/Q80MfH7xPPE/50020 THERE ARE LIMITS TO WHAT WE CAN MAKE OF OURSELVES
trainval/Q80MfH7xPPE/50021 IN THE SAME WAY WE'RE NOT ILLUSIONS EITHER
trainval/Qa2HpQI1Ufg/50001 SO BEFORE THE INTERNET NEIGHBORHOODS WOULD GATHER AT BARBECUES OR A PORCH
trainval/Qa2HpQI1Ufg/50002 AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF THIS IS CROWDFUNDING
trainval/Qa2HpQI1Ufg/50003 SO YOU'RE A MAC OR YOU'RE A PC RIGHT
trainval/Qa2HpQI1Ufg/50004 SO BY LOOKING AT WHAT THE USERS ARE DEMANDING OF EACH PLATFORM WHAT VINE USERS DISLIKE ABOUT
trainval/Qa2HpQI1Ufg/50005 WE AS INDIVIDUALS ALL HAVE UNIQUE ASSETS THAT MAKE US VALUABLE IN THIS WORLD
trainval/Qa2HpQI1Ufg/50006 EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT I REACH OUT AND TALK TO PEOPLE FROM ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD I KNOW THAT I'M LEARNING NEW
trainval/QAd54DkXCr4/50002 ARE YOU REALLY LISTENING
trainval/QAd54DkXCr4/50003 0 HOW DO YOU GET TO 1
trainval/QAd54DkXCr4/50005 WHAT DO YOU ROCK AT
trainval/QAd54DkXCr4/50006 WHAT WOULD THEY SAY ABOUT YOU
trainval/QAd54DkXCr4/50007 THINK ABOUT THAT
trainval/QAd54DkXCr4/50008 WE ALL KNOW HOW TO SHOW UP WELL WHEN WE WANT TO
trainval/QAd54DkXCr4/50009 WE KNOW HOW TO DO THAT SO YOU CAN FAKE THAT
trainval/QAnNM3WJCYA/50001 THESE IDEAS REMINDED ME OF THREE CHALLENGING INSTANCES IN MY LIFE THAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU
trainval/QAnNM3WJCYA/50002 IT'S A STORY ABOUT COURAGE ABOUT A MAN NAME BENAIAH WHO CHASED A LION DOWN INTO A PIT
trainval/Qao76IPXWSE/50001 THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF SEEING A PERSON FIRST
trainval/qaue72D9pSI/50001 BUT IF YOU STAY IN SCHOOL AND YOU WORK HARD MAYBE YOU CAN COME BACK AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS
trainval/qaue72D9pSI/50002 THEY WANT TO DO IT 9 TO 5 AND LEAVE THE PROBLEM AND ESCAPE TO THE SAFETY OF THEIR OWN HOMES
trainval/qaue72D9pSI/50003 THEY ARE AFRAID TO GET THEIR HANDS DIRTY
trainval/qaue72D9pSI/50004 THAT WE'VE GOT PEOPLE THAT COME IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND COME IN OUR SCHOOLS WANTING TO TEACH BECAUSE WE NEED HELP
trainval/qaue72D9pSI/50005 BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY DON'T EVEN TRY TO UNDERSTAND US
trainval/qaue72D9pSI/50006 I GREW UP IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS WITH THEM
trainval/qaue72D9pSI/50007 I KNOW THEM
trainval/qAYqK9lAxic/50001 AND THAT'S WHAT I AND OTHERS ARE AIMING TO DO FOR PLANETS FAR AWAY AROUND OTHER STARS
trainval/qAYqK9lAxic/50002 ASTRONOMERS HAVE FOUND THAT EACH STAR IN OUR SKY HAS AT LEAST ONE PLANET
trainval/qAYqK9lAxic/50003 THIS IS A REAL IMAGE OF EARTH
trainval/qAYqK9lAxic/50004 SO WHAT WE WOULD DO IS WE'D NEED TO ANALYZE LIGHT IN MORE DETAIL AND LET ME EXPLAIN THAT BY THIS PICTURE OF A
trainval/qAYqK9lAxic/50005 IT'S VERY HARD TO THINK THAT DEEPLY THAT OUTSIDE OF THE BOX
trainval/qAYqK9lAxic/50007 I DON'T KNOW IF THIS HAPPENS TO ANYBODY HERE BUT SOMEONE HAS USUALLY A VERY {LG}
trainval/qAYqK9lAxic/50009 AND ACTUALLY ALL LIFE ON EARTH REQUIRES LIQUID WATER
trainval/qAYqK9lAxic/50010 AND WHAT MY TEAM FOUND WAS THAT SOME OF THESE THAT ARE NOT PRODUCED BY LIFE FALL INTO VERY
trainval/qAYqK9lAxic/50011 AND SO WHEN WE LOOK FOR ANOTHER EARTH WHEN WE ARE ABLE TO LOOK AT SPECTRA OF OTHER PLANETS WE'D LIKE TO SEE
trainval/qAYqK9lAxic/50012 WE DIDN'T SET OUT TO MAKE GPS SO THAT WE CAN ALL FIGURE OUT HOW TO NAVIGATE
trainval/qAYqK9lAxic/50013 EXOPLANETS ARE SO SMALL AND SO FAINT AND SO LESS MASSIVE THAN THEIR BRIGHT ADJACENT HOST STAR
trainval/QBDShp6U7tU/50001 WHY DOES ANY OF THIS MATTER AT ALL
trainval/QBDShp6U7tU/50002 BY THE TIME IT LANDS THEY WILL ALREADY KNOW IF ANYTHING NEEDS TO BE SERVICED
trainval/QBDShp6U7tU/50004 OVER THE PAST 200 YEARS THE WORLD HAS EXPERIENCED TWO MAJOR WAVES OF INNOVATION
trainval/QBDShp6U7tU/50005 IT MEANS MORE PATIENTS CAN BE TREATED MORE LIVES CAN BE SAVED
trainval/QBDShp6U7tU/50006 BY 2020 THEY WILL ACCOUNT FOR OVER 50 PERCENT OF ALL DIGITAL INFORMATION
trainval/QBDShp6U7tU/50007 IT'S THE MARRIAGE OF MINDS AND MACHINES
trainval/QBDShp6U7tU/50008 IT MAKES PRODUCTS MORE AFFORDABLE
trainval/QBDShp6U7tU/50009 IT CREATES NEW DEMAND NEW JOBS
trainval/QBDShp6U7tU/50010 AND BELIEVE ME AS AN ECONOMIST I AM ALSO SCARED
trainval/QBDShp6U7tU/50011 SHE ALREADY HAS ALL THE SPARE PARTS BECAUSE THE PROBLEMS WERE DIAGNOSED IN ADVANCED
trainval/QBDShp6U7tU/50012 THEY SAY THAT ALL THE GROWTH ENHANCING INNOVATIONS ARE BEHIND US
trainval/QBDShp6U7tU/50013 HUMAN CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION HAVE ALWAYS PROPELLED US FORWARD
trainval/QBDShp6U7tU/50014 THEY'VE CREATED JOBS
trainval/QBDShp6U7tU/50015 THEY'VE RAISED LIVING STANDARDS
trainval/QBDShp6U7tU/50016 WE WILL NEED A ROBUST CYBERSECURITY APPROACH THAT PROTECTS SENSITIVE INFORMATION AND INTELLECTUAL
trainval/QBDShp6U7tU/50017 AND THE EDUCATION SYSTEM WILL NEED TO EVOLVE TO ENSURE STUDENTS ARE EQUIPPED WITH THE RIGHT SKILLS
trainval/qBHIT9yEPh4/50001 AND WE ARE VERY HAPPY TO BE PART OF THE TED FAMILY
trainval/QbSD6PTcmfs/50001 THERE WAS NO AUDIBLE VOICE BUT MY FATHER CALLED OUT MY NAME POWERFULLY
trainval/QbSD6PTcmfs/50002 JUST 72 HOURS AFTER HIS STROKE HE HAD ALREADY EMBRACED THE
trainval/QbxinUJcLGg/50001 IN TERMS OF PARTICIPATION IN SOCIETY IT'S PROBABLY THE FACT THAT I HAVE NO LEGS THAT HAS MORE OF AN
trainval/QbxinUJcLGg/50002 AND SURE THE USUAL SUSPECTS ARE TO BLAME
trainval/QbxinUJcLGg/50003 NOW I'D HAD A COUPLE OF OPERATIONS BEFORE THEN
trainval/QbxinUJcLGg/50004 LUCKILY IT DIDN'T COME TO THAT
trainval/QbxinUJcLGg/50005 TAKE MY STORY FOR EXAMPLE
trainval/QbxinUJcLGg/50007 SO I SAT DOWN WITH MY PARENTS AT THE SAME KITCHEN TABLE WHERE MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS HAD VOTED TO BRING ME HOME 14
trainval/QbxinUJcLGg/50008 I THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION
trainval/QbxinUJcLGg/50009 SURE IF YOU WANT TO GO TO MOUNT EVEREST GO WALK UP TO BASE CAMP WAVE AT THE SUMMIT
trainval/QbxinUJcLGg/50010 AND I WENT IN TO HIS STUDIO AND LOOKED AT THIS MASSIVE PORTRAIT OF MY FACE AND
trainval/QbxinUJcLGg/50011 SO WHAT THEY TOLD MY PARENTS WAS LOOK
trainval/QC3EbSexmDw/50001 I CAN'T BE DYSLEXIC AND STUPID
trainval/QcnuWDZuYy0/50002 PUT SOME ELECTRONICS BEHIND IT YOU GOT YOURSELF A RAIN GAUGE
trainval/QcnuWDZuYy0/50003 IT DOESN'T COMPLY WITH THE WHOLE ROBUST THING I JUST SAID
trainval/Qd5rAVHT6Vw/50001 NOW OUR FAST ACTING RESULTS WERE PRETTY INTERESTING BUT WE STILL HAD ONE LINGERING QUESTION CAN OUR STICKY
trainval/Qd7PiXg5fKE/50001 IN 1994 WHICH WAS THE YEAR THAT I WAS 13 YEARS OLD AND FIGURED OUT I WAS GAY
trainval/Qd7PiXg5fKE/50002 BUT IT WAS ALSO BECAUSE IT WAS SO DANGEROUS IT WAS SO RISKY IT WAS SO
trainval/Qd7PiXg5fKE/50003 IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY UNDERGROUND
trainval/Qd7PiXg5fKE/50004 IT'S A PERFORMANCE RIGHT
trainval/Qd7PiXg5fKE/50005 THERE ARE TWO WORDS
trainval/QdAG161FeT8/50001 SO WE REACHED OUT
trainval/QdAG161FeT8/50002 WE HOLD THE GENIUS BAR TO REACH OUT TO THE COMMUNITY AND MORE TEACHERS
trainval/QdAG161FeT8/50003 THE TECHXPERTS THE IWIZARDS THE TECH CLUB
trainval/QdAG161FeT8/50004 BUT ONCE YOUR TEAM IS DEVELOPED CREATE GOALS AND DETERMINE WHAT KIND OF IMPACT YOU WANT TO MAKE
trainval/qdiF1fSGfyM/50001 SOON AFTER I COMMITTED MY FIRST CRIME AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT I WAS TOLD THAT I HAD POTENTIAL AND FELT
trainval/qdiF1fSGfyM/50002 I COULDN'T READ WRITE OR SPELL
trainval/qdiF1fSGfyM/50003 THEY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT MY LIFE
trainval/qdiF1fSGfyM/50004 AND I SAID WHAT'S THAT
trainval/qdiF1fSGfyM/50005 I MEAN HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO IT
trainval/qdiF1fSGfyM/50006 I WAS TRAPPED IN A CAGE PREY AMONG PREDATORS FIGHTING FOR FREEDOM I NEVER HAD
trainval/qdiF1fSGfyM/50007 CANDY WRAPPERS CLOTHING LOGOS STREET SIGNS EVERYTHING
trainval/qdiF1fSGfyM/50008 CHECK THIS OUT
trainval/qdiF1fSGfyM/50009 IT'S A LIFESTYLE
trainval/QeAGu40vZzI/50001 AND IN MANY WAYS HACKING IS WHAT BUILT AMERICA
trainval/QeAGu40vZzI/50002 SO KEEP THAT IN MIND
trainval/QeAGu40vZzI/50003 IT'S ABOUT CRITICAL THINKING
trainval/QeAGu40vZzI/50004 IT'S ABOUT QUESTIONING EXISTING WAYS OF DOING THINGS
trainval/QeAGu40vZzI/50005 THEY'RE CREATING A WHOLE NEW SET OF WAYS FOR CITIZENS TO BE INVOLVED BESIDES VOTING OR SIGNING A
trainval/QeAGu40vZzI/50006 WE HAVE 31 BRIGADES IN THE U
trainval/qegYP10m2lo/50001 EVEN THE SALAD HATERS THAT COME TO THE GROWHAUS TRY IT AND GO NUTS FOR IT
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50001 WHAT STARTED OFF AS WHAT SEEMED TO BE A BAD CASE OF ASTHMA SOON GREW INTO SOMETHING MUCH WORSE
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50002 I WAS SOON MISSING SCHOOL WEEKS AT A TIME
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50003 I KNOW ALL YOUR KIDS BACK HOME ARE PROBABLY THINKING FREE VACATION
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50004 BUT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50005 I SPENT MOST OF MY DAYS BEDRIDDEN
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50006 I WAS BASICALLY A REGULAR AT MY LOCAL DOCTOR'S OFFICE
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50007 EVERYONE THERE KNEW ME BY NAME
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50008 I WAS LIKE A CELEBRITY
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50009 WHAT CAN I GET YA
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50010 NOW IT'S THE FLU
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50011 OH NO YOU GOT PNEUMONIA
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50012 I WAS JUST TRYING TO LIVE MY LIFE
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50013 I WAS KNOWN TO PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE AS THE KID WHO COUGHED ALL THE TIME
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50014 I REMEMBER ALL THE COUNTLESS ANGRY STARES I'D GET AS MY COUGHING WOULD INTERRUPT THEM WHILE THEY WERE TAKING A QUIZ
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50015 YOU'RE GOING TO BED AT 10 P
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50016 IT IS SILENT
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50017 NO OF COURSE NOT BECAUSE YOUR LIFE IS TERRIBLE
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50018 BUT THE QUESTION IS
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50019 HOW ARE WE GOING TO FIX THIS
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50020 HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET UNSAD
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50021 I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A WORD DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50022 ONE YOU CAN WALLOW IN YOUR OWN DESPAIR LIKE SOME ANGST FILLED SHAKESPEAREAN CHARACTER
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50023 TO SHOW YOU THIS I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU MY OWN STORY
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50024 I WAS ONLY IN THIS WORLD FOR A FEW MINUTES AND I'D ALREADY MET MY GREATEST ENEMY
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50025 IF THERE WAS A COMPETITION FOR BEING UNLUCKY WE'D UNFORTUNATELY LOSE IN THE LAST FEW SECONDS BECAUSE SOMETHING LUCKY HAPPENED TAKING US OUT OF
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50026 HOBBIES BECOME CHORES AND FRIENDS BECOME STRANGERS
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50027 YOU FEEL OVERWHELMED AS LIFE BECOMES TOO DAUNTING A TASK TO TAKE ON AND THE WORLD DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THAT GREAT INVITING PLACE IT USED
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50028 FOURTH DON'T YOU DARE THINK THAT THE ANSWER IS GOING TO BE FOUND IN SOME PILL OR AT THE BOTTOM OF A BOTTLE UNLESS
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50029 TAKE A COOKING CLASS OR SOMETHING
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50030 ENTERING MY FIRST YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL MY LUNGS HAD ME ON THE ROPES
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50031 I KNOW IT CAN BE HARD SOMETIMES BUT IF YOU REALLY DIG DEEP ENOUGH YOU CAN FIND A BRIGHT SIDE
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50032 YOU LOST YOUR JOB
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50033 JUST A FEW MONTHS IN AND I WAS AS BAD AS I HAD EVER BEEN
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50034 ONE DAY I MADE THE VERY STUPID DECISION TO TRY AND GO OUT AND RUN AND HAVE A GOOD TIME
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50035 SILLY ME RIGHT
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50036 WITHIN MINUTES I WAS ON THE GROUND UNABLE TO BREATHE
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50037 BUT ANYWAYS THIS WAS BAD REALLY BAD LIKE FINDING OUT YOUR FAVORITE TV SHOW WAS CANCELED BAD
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50038 COME FOR THE FUN STAY FOR THE FOOD AM I RIGHT
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50039 I COULD TELL YOU THE MANY TIMES I THOUGHT ABOUT FINDING A WAY TO END IT RIGHT THEN AND THERE
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50040 I COULD TELL YOU THE VARIOUS TUBES THEY HAD SHOVED IN MY BODY OR THE TIME MY LUNG COLLAPSED
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50041 OR THE SECOND TIME
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50042 I COULD ALSO TELL YOU ABOUT ALL THE COUNTLESS PATIENTS ALL FIGHTING THEIR OWN UNIQUE BATTLES JUST AS I WAS FIGHTING MY OWN
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50043 I COULD TELL YOU ABOUT THE COURAGE AND OPTIMISM THEY SHOWED ONE I WISHED I COULD EMULATE
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50044 THAT LIFE CAN SOMETIMES SUCK
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50045 AND MORE IMPORTANTLY I WASN'T GOING TO INTENTIONALLY PUT MYSELF DOWN BECAUSE I DIDN'T FEEL GOOD ENOUGH
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50046 FOR ALL I COULD CARE THE OLD ME DIED IN THAT HOSPITAL
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50047 I WAS BORN ANEW AND GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE AND THIS TIME I WAS GOING TO TAKE LIFE BY THE REINS AND ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50048 WITH MY NEWFOUND SPIRIT I DISCOVERED A PASSION FOR THEATER AND A LOVE FOR THE STAGE
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50049 I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING YOU
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50050 I HAD LIVED IN DARKNESS FOR SO LONG THAT MY MIND BEGAN TO WARP ITS OWN SURROUNDINGS
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50051 THAT'S HOW YOU THINK WHEN IN THAT STATE
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50052 SURE I WAS DIFFERENT BUT THAT DIDN'T MATTER ANYMORE
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50053 MIDNIGHT CAN CREATE A SENSE OF UNFRIENDLINESS TO ALL AROUND YOU
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50054 YOU'RE SO HANDSOME AND A CONSTANT SOURCE OF INSPIRATION BUT HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO FEEL HAPPY WHEN EVERYTHING AROUND ME FEELS SO
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50055 WHAT WAS JUST A BRANCH TAPPING ON THE WINDOW NOW SEEMS LIKE A TERRIBLE MONSTER TRYING TO GET IN
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50056 KEEPING ALL YOUR FEELINGS PENT UP LIKE THAT IS A RECIPE FOR DISASTER
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50057 NEED HELP CRYING
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50058 THE ONCE COOL AND CALMING BREEZE NOW HOWLS AGAINST YOUR EARDRUMS
trainval/QekbuidfQKo/50059 AND TO THOSE WHO LOCK THEMSELVES IN THEIR ROOM DENYING THAT THINGS WILL EVER CHANGE THE DAWN WILL NEVER COME AND THEY WERE MEANT TO LIVE IN
trainval/qErZ2AQDMB4/50001 CAN WE FIND THAT LANGUAGE
trainval/qErZ2AQDMB4/50002 THEY WANT POSITIVE ACTIONS THEY CAN ENGAGE IN AND IN THEIR BONES THEY KNOW IT'S TIME TO TAKE PERSONAL
trainval/qErZ2AQDMB4/50004 AND THEN BECAUSE WE KNOW WE'VE GOT VEGETABLE TOURISTS AND WE LOVE THEM TO BITS AND THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC WE THOUGHT WHAT COULD WE DO TO GIVE
trainval/qErZ2AQDMB4/50013 WHAT COULD WE ACTUALLY DO
trainval/qErZ2AQDMB4/50016 SO WE DID SOME REALLY SIMPLE THINGS
trainval/qesLGw23SzQ/50002 AND LET NO IMMIGRANTS IN ANYMORE BUILD A WALL
trainval/qEZmFR1WS7g/50001 THERE WAS NOTHING SIGNED
trainval/qEZmFR1WS7g/50002 SHARECROPPING IS WHAT MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND ON THE EASTERN PLAINS
trainval/QfODW06Qi8E/50001 WELL I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT HAPPENED TO GANDALF
trainval/QfODW06Qi8E/50002 HE FELL A LONG WAY
trainval/QfODW06Qi8E/50003 OK NOW LET ME START READING
trainval/QfODW06Qi8E/50004 EVENING NUMBER 2
trainval/QfODW06Qi8E/50006 IT'S BECOMING MORE PERVASIVE
trainval/QfODW06Qi8E/50007 YOU THINK 2015 2016 REPRESENT A CHALLENGE
trainval/QfODW06Qi8E/50008 WELL WHERE DO YOU THINK WE ARE GOING TO BE 5 YEARS FROM NOW
trainval/QfODW06Qi8E/50009 AND YOU ARE LIKING IT AND YOU ARE SHARING IT AND EVERYTHING BUT YOU REALIZED YOU HAVEN'T ACTUALLY SEEN THAT PERSON
trainval/QfODW06Qi8E/50010 I WAS GOING ON VACATION TO HAWAII SPECIFICALLY THE WEST COAST OF MAUI
trainval/QfODW06Qi8E/50011 THE FIRST EVENING TAKES PLACE AND WAS MUCH MORE TYPICAL BEFORE MY HAWAII TRIP
trainval/QfODW06Qi8E/50012 NOW THERE ARE POSITIVES TO THIS
trainval/QfODW06Qi8E/50013 I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU TOMORROW
trainval/QfODW06Qi8E/50014 SEVERAL OF US CAN CHECK THINGS LIKE THE WEATHER REPORTS THE LOCAL ART EXHIBITS COMING TO TOWN WONDERFUL INFORMATION
trainval/QfODW06Qi8E/50015 WELL YOU KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY I HAVE A STAFF MEMBER THAT I CAN DELEGATE THAT RIGHT OVER TO YOU
trainval/QfODW06Qi8E/50016 I'M ACTUALLY ABOUT TO GO AND DO A BEDTIME ROUTINE WITH MY KIDS TONIGHT
trainval/qFOooWq2inA/50001 AND WE DID THAT
trainval/qFOooWq2inA/50002 AT THIS POINT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES JUST WENT CRAZY
trainval/qFOooWq2inA/50003 THAT WAS TOO FAR FOR US SO WE ASK OUR BOSS IN JYV SKYL IF SHE COULD DO THE SNOOPING FOR US
trainval/qFOooWq2inA/50004 THIS OLD FORTRESS ISLAND OFF THE COAST OF HELSINKI
trainval/qFOooWq2inA/50006 IT'S ABOUT LEARNING ABOUT YOURSELF HOW TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF
trainval/qFza3W87eDg/50001 WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SPEAK ON
trainval/qFza3W87eDg/50002 I SAID YES THAT'D BE REALLY NICE
trainval/qFza3W87eDg/50003 AND HE WROTE BACK AND SAID SO WHAT ARE YOU SPEAKING ON
trainval/qFza3W87eDg/50004 AND I THOUGHT WELL WHAT AM I INTERESTED IN
trainval/qFza3W87eDg/50005 BUT ACTUALLY WHY WAS I GOING TO TEDX
trainval/qFza3W87eDg/50006 WAS IT ONE THING IN PARTICULAR
trainval/qFza3W87eDg/50007 WHY DID YOU COME
trainval/qFza3W87eDg/50008 WAS IT ONE LECTURE
trainval/qFza3W87eDg/50009 AND THEN THE LITTLE BOY SAID TO ME WHAT ARE YOU WRITING
trainval/qFza3W87eDg/50010 AND THAT'S PRETTY INSPIRATIONAL I HAVE TO SAY
trainval/qFza3W87eDg/50011 AND THE FIRST THING WE DO WHEN WE COME ACROSS A VICTIM OF TRAUMA IS WE ASSESS THEM FOR BREATHING
trainval/qFza3W87eDg/50012 IN 2004 I HAD A BABY BOY TRANSFERRED TO MY CARE WITH HIRSCHSPRUNG'S DISEASE
trainval/qFza3W87eDg/50013 AND WE DID A SURGERY AND HE WENT HOME WITH THREE WEEKS OF AGE PARENTS WERE DELIGHTED EVERYTHING WAS A SUCCESS
trainval/qFza3W87eDg/50014 THE DOCTOR ON THE PHONE SAID THERE'S ONE PROBLEM
trainval/qFza3W87eDg/50015 AND THEN THE DOCTOR SAID TO ME BUT THERE'S SOMETHING YOU NEED TO KNOW
trainval/qFza3W87eDg/50016 AND THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE INSPIRATION DOES FOR US
trainval/qFza3W87eDg/50017 NOW IT MAY BE SUNSETS IT MAY BE A SPORTING HERO IT MAY BE A PIECE OF MUSIC IT
trainval/QG4Z185MBJE/50001 THAT REALLY CAME TO HEAD FOR ME WHEN MY SON WAS ABOUT 3 MONTH OLD AND I WAS HOME TAKING
trainval/QG4Z185MBJE/50002 PARENTS AMONG YOU WILL NOT BE SURPRISED TO FIND OUT THAT ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY MY SON TOOK ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF LONGER
trainval/QG4Z185MBJE/50003 IT PUSHES PEOPLE AWAY
trainval/QG4Z185MBJE/50004 BUT WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT YOU OR SOMEONE WHO REALLY STRUGGLES WITH ANGER CAN GET VERY USED TO THE SIGHT OF
trainval/QG4Z185MBJE/50005 DON'T GET ME WRONG I HAVE NO ASPIRATIONS TO BE THE LEADER OF A WORLDWIDE RELIGION
trainval/QG4Z185MBJE/50006 WE LIKE FEELING STRONG
trainval/QG4Z185MBJE/50007 AND AFTER A WHILE ALL THOSE TERRIFYING EMOTIONS JUST STOPPED BEING SO TERRIFYING AND START BEING NORMAL HUMAN
trainval/QG4Z185MBJE/50008 SLOWING DOWN THE BODY CAN HELP SLOW DOWN THE MIND
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50001 I KNEW HIS HOPES AND HIS DREAMS FOR THE FUTURE
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50002 I KNEW HE LOVED ME
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50003 I HAD GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50004 MY INCREASING LEVEL OF DEPRAVITY WAS FUELED BY DRUGS AND ALCOHOL
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50005 THOSE TWO WORLDS STARTED CRASHING TOGETHER AND THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO TO STOP IT
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50006 ONCE I WAS SMOKING CRACK NOTHING ELSE MATTERED
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50007 I FELT DEAD INSIDE LIKE MY SOUL WAS GONE
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50008 THAT SPARKED SOMETHING INSIDE OF ME
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50009 IT BLEW MY MIND THAT PEOPLE WERE WILLING TO FORGIVE ME FOR SOMETHING THAT I CONSIDERED UNFORGIVABLE
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50010 I STARTED TO BELIEVE THAT MAYBE THERE WAS HOPE FOR ME
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50011 OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS PEOPLE WERE PLACED IN MY LIFE FOR REASONS THAT I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND AT THE TIME
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50012 A LOT OF FRIENDS HELPED ME ALONG THE WAY
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50013 NEW FRIENDS LIKE GINGER WOULD LISTEN TO ME CRY IN THOSE EARLY DAYS WHEN I COULDN'T IMAGINE TELLING
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50014 MANY YEARS AGO
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50015 MYRNA HEARD ABOUT MY ARREST AND SHE CONTACTED ME
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50016 AND BEFORE SHE PASSED AWAY SHE WORKED THE STEPS WITH ME
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50017 MY FRIENDS WERE HELPING ME TO COME TO TERMS WITH WHO I WAS MY ADDICTION MY
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50018 BUT I WAS ALLOWING A WALL OF DENIAL TO BUILD UP AROUND MY CRIME AND WHY I
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50019 IT WAS EASY TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO THINK IT WAS ALL MY CO DEFENDANTS' FAULT
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50020 I DIDN'T CORRECT PEOPLE WHEN THEY MADE THAT ASSUMPTION
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50021 IT WASN'T UNTIL I PARTICIPATED IN A VIOLENCE PREVENTION GROUP THAT THAT WALL OF DENIAL
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50022 THAT GROUP MADE ME CONFRONT THE REALITY OF WHO I AM AND WHAT I'D DONE
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50023 AT FIRST I COULDN'T EVEN SAY MY VICTIM'S NAME BUT I KNEW I HAD TO FACE WHAT I'D DONE
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50024 I STOPPED BRUSHING ASIDE THE PSYCHOLOGIST'S SUGGESTIONS AND I BEGAN ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50025 I JOURNALED ABOUT MY FEELINGS AND THINGS I WANTED TO SAY TO MY VICTIM
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50027 I WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WRITE SUCH AN HONEST INTROSPECTIVE LETTER HAD I NOT DONE ALL THE
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50028 MY PHYSICAL MENTAL AND SPIRITUAL HEALTH ARE VALUABLE TO ME
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50029 I'M ENGAGED IN LIFE AND I LIVE WITH INTENTION AND DELIBERATENESS
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50030 I HAVE HOPE FOR THE FUTURE
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50031 I'M NOT THE SAME PERSON I USED TO BE
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50032 FORGIVING MYSELF DOESN'T MEAN THAT I FORGET
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50033 I COULD NEVER FORGET
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50034 IT WAS GUT WRENCHING WORK BUT NECESSARY FOR MY SURVIVAL
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50035 CREATE YOUR OWN PATH OF HEALING AND REDEMPTION
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50036 MAY GOD BLESS YOU
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50037 I HAD TO COME TO A PLACE OF ACCEPTANCE
trainval/qG6SnAIinj0/50038 MAILING THAT LETTER FREED SOMETHING IN ME
trainval/qGSYmIPFO68/50001 SO THIS IS A VERY COMMON DISEASE
trainval/qGSYmIPFO68/50002 I BEGAN THIS TALK WITH MODELS
trainval/qGSYmIPFO68/50003 CHRIS ANDERSON I REALLY LIKE THIS METAPHOR
trainval/qgv8VoyJ3wA/50001 WE WRITE BOOKS ABOUT IT WE WRITE NOVELS ABOUT IT WE MAKE FILMS ABOUT IT
trainval/qgv8VoyJ3wA/50002 IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY QUITE INSPIRING
trainval/qgv8VoyJ3wA/50003 WHAT THEY REALLY WANT IS A MYTH
trainval/qgv8VoyJ3wA/50004 IF THAT STORY MAKES US FEEL GOOD ABOUT OURSELVES THEN SO MUCH THE BETTER
trainval/qgv8VoyJ3wA/50005 BECAUSE IT'S NOT ALL IN THE PAST
trainval/qgv8VoyJ3wA/50006 AND THERE IS A DARK SIDE TO ALL OF THESE STORIES AND MYTHS THAT CAN BE REALLY DAMAGING
trainval/QgZfyTguSPM/50001 ONE TIME I TRIED TO ORGANIZE ALL OF MY BOOKS BY GENRE
trainval/QgZfyTguSPM/50002 WHAT HERS IS
trainval/QgZfyTguSPM/50003 I GUESS IT IS ME BUT NOT REALLY
trainval/QgZfyTguSPM/50004 SAM IS A TOMBOY WITH A FLAT BRIM HAT AND STRAIGHT BLOND HAIR DOWN HER BELLY BUTTON
trainval/QgZfyTguSPM/50005 WHATEVER THE SCENARIO THINK ABOUT WHY THE BOX IS THERE AND IF IT IS IMPORTANT
trainval/QgZfyTguSPM/50006 THE BEST THING IS TO MAKE SURE THE BOX WE USE ISN'T A LIMITATION
trainval/qH4GAXXH29s/50001 IT BECAME A BOOK
trainval/qH4GAXXH29s/50002 IT BECAME A SHOW
trainval/qH4GAXXH29s/50003 WE GAVE THIS LAND BACK TO NATURE
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50001 HIS CHOLESTEROL HIS TRIGLYCERIDES HIS BLOOD PRESSURE
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50002 HE WAS READY TO MAKE A CHANGE
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50003 HE TOOK HIS OWN GOOD PLAN AND HE MADE IT HIS OWN AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S THE REASON WHY HE STUCK TO IT
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50004 HE LOST OVER 20 POUNDS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY HIS NUMBERS CAME DOWN INTO THE NORMAL
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50005 AFTER ALL I COULD CRAFT AN ENTIRE DAY FOR YOU MINUTE BY MINUTE VEGETABLE BY
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50006 IT HAS TO BE YOUR OWN GOOD PLAN
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50007 AND BY GOOD PLAN I MEAN IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT FEELS GOOD BECAUSE IF IT FEELS GOOD YOU ARE MORE APT TO
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50008 WHETHER YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT 10 POUNDS 20 POUNDS 15 POUNDS IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50009 I KNOW TO ME WHEN I THINK ABOUT LOSING WEIGHT THAT IS SO DAUNTING
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50010 SO DOES IT FEEL GOOD TO YOU WHEN YOU SAY I'D LIKE TO LOSE 20 POUNDS OR IF WE LOOK AT IT
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50011 I LIKE BEING STRONG AND I USED TO DO 25 PUSH UPS MOST MORNINGS
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50012 AND THEN YOU KNOW LIFE KICKS IN THE BUSYNESS HAPPENS AND I GOT OUT OF THAT HABIT
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50013 WHICH ONE FEELS BETTER
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50014 WHAT IF WE THINK ABOUT THAT DIFFERENTLY
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50015 INSTEAD OF EXERCISE WHAT IF WE JUST TALK ABOUT MOVING YOUR BODY
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50016 DID YOU WALK AT ALL YESTERDAY
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50017 JUST DO IT JUST START SOMEWHERE
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50018 THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH WATER YOU DRANK YESTERDAY AND JUST DRINK A LITTLE BIT MORE TODAY
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50019 BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN WE ARE HEADED ON A HEALTHY PATH MANY TIMES THE CONCEPT OF CHOCOLATE CAKE
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50020 AND IT'S TRULY HUMAN NATURE TO WANT WHAT WE CAN'T HAVE
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50021 SO YOU NEED TO GRANT YOURSELF PERMISSION TO EAT THAT CAKE
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50022 ONE MORE PIECE AND I'M GOING TO BE SICK
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50023 BUT IT ALL GOES BACK TO YOUR DESIRE
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50024 AND AGAIN YOU NEED TO HONOR YOUR BODY
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50025 AND THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO EAT THAT CHOCOLATE CAKE NO DISTRACTIONS
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50026 BECAUSE AGAIN A GOOD PLAN IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO AND IF A GOOD PLAN IS SOMETHING YOU CAN
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50027 SO START TODAY SOMEWHERE TAKE ONE PIECE TAKE ONE THING THAT I'VE SAID
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50028 THINK BACK TO YESTERDAY AND HOW MUCH YOU MOVED YOUR BODY HOW MUCH WATER YOUR DRANK HOW MANY
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50029 AND JUST DO A LITTLE MORE TODAY
trainval/QhLLMBN57AU/50030 YOU HAVE TO GIVE YOURSELF PERMISSION TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF YOU
trainval/Qhomjw2PSV0/50001 THIS IS NOT PETTY FRAUD
trainval/Qhomjw2PSV0/50002 HOW DOES THAT PLAY OUT
trainval/Qhomjw2PSV0/50003 AND ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU DISREGARD IT THEN THERE ARE HIGHER CHANCES OF NOT GETTING YOUR BONUS OR ITS BEING
trainval/Qhomjw2PSV0/50004 IN OTHER WORDS THIS IS A VERY ECONOMIC MOTIVATION OF TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO BE MORE HONEST
trainval/Qhomjw2PSV0/50005 PEOPLE ARE MOTIVATED BY DIFFERENT VALUES PERHAPS
trainval/Qhomjw2PSV0/50006 WE STRIP AWAY FACTS WHICH ARE CONFUSING IN REALITY
trainval/Qhomjw2PSV0/50007 REALITY IS SO RICH THERE IS SO MUCH GOING ON IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHAT DRIVES PEOPLE'S
trainval/Qhomjw2PSV0/50008 FOR EVERY TIME THAT YOU ANNOUNCE THAT YOU HAD A TAILS THROW YOU GET PAID FIVE FRANCS
trainval/Qhomjw2PSV0/50009 YOU LEAVE 20 FRANCS ON THE TABLE BY ANNOUNCING ZERO
trainval/Qhomjw2PSV0/50010 WELL IT SEEMS PEOPLE ARE MOTIVATED BY CERTAIN INTRINSIC VALUES AND IN OUR RESEARCH WE LOOK AT
trainval/Qhomjw2PSV0/50011 WE LOOK AT THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE HAVE SO CALLED PROTECTED VALUES
trainval/Qhomjw2PSV0/50013 BY THE WAY I'M NOT A MORAL AUTHORITY
trainval/Qhomjw2PSV0/50014 I'M NOT SAYING I HAVE ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL VALUES RIGHT
trainval/Qhomjw2PSV0/50015 I DO NOT YET KNOW WHERE THESE PROTECTED VALUES REALLY COME FROM
trainval/Qhomjw2PSV0/50016 IT LOOKS PRETTY SIMILAR FOR THOSE WHO HAD STUDIED ECONOMICS OR THOSE WHO HAD STUDIED
trainval/Qhomjw2PSV0/50017 BUT I DON'T KNOW YET HOW THIS DEVELOPS OVER A LIFETIME
trainval/Qhomjw2PSV0/50018 BUT DO THINK ABOUT SELECTING THE RIGHT PEOPLE RATHER THAN HAVING PEOPLE AND THEN
trainval/Qhomjw2PSV0/50019 SELECTING THE RIGHT PEOPLE WITH THE RIGHT VALUES MAY GO A LONG WAY TO SAVING A LOT OF TROUBLE
trainval/Qhomjw2PSV0/50020 IN OTHER WORDS IT WILL PAY OFF TO PUT PEOPLE FIRST
trainval/QHSrG9Tuz84/50001 WHAT DO I MEAN BY THESE KINDS OF THERAPEUTICS
trainval/QHSrG9Tuz84/50002 SO WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT
trainval/Qi8MoU6g8Sc/50001 AND I WENT WITH HIM TO THE EVENT IN ROTTERDAM
trainval/Qi8MoU6g8Sc/50002 AND THERE I SPOKE TO A GUY THAT WAS DOING SOMETHING WITH SUSTAINABLE CARDBOARD BEACH HOUSES
trainval/Qi8MoU6g8Sc/50003 WE SHOULD MAKE A TENT OUT OF CARDBOARD
trainval/Qi8MoU6g8Sc/50004 AND ACTUALLY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT'S NOT THAT CRAZY AFTER ALL
trainval/Qi8MoU6g8Sc/50005 CARDBOARD IS LIGHT WEIGHT IT'S FOLDABLE AND IT'S VERY EASY TO RECYCLE
trainval/Qi8MoU6g8Sc/50006 TO SEE IF IT WAS STILL DRY FROM THE INSIDE
trainval/Qi8MoU6g8Sc/50007 THAT WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF OUR LUCKIEST THINGS DURING THE PROCESS BECAUSE AS SOON AS THE TENTS ARRIVED A HUGE TRUCK
trainval/Qi8MoU6g8Sc/50008 5 METERS AND 5 METERS HIGH BECAME VISIBLE
trainval/Qi8MoU6g8Sc/50009 WHERE EVERYTHING IS MADE OUT OF CARDBOARD
trainval/QijH4UAqGD8/50001 AND THAT SAME SEMESTER I STARTED BLOGGING
trainval/QijH4UAqGD8/50002 I WENT ZIPLINING THROUGH THE FORESTS OF PUNTA CANA
trainval/QijH4UAqGD8/50003 WE SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE JUSTICE
trainval/QijH4UAqGD8/50004 BUT PEOPLE LIKE ME THE PROFESSIONAL TROUBLEMAKERS SHOULD NOT BE THE ONLY ONES WHO ARE COMMITTED TO BEING THESE DOMINOES WHO ARE ALWAYS FALLING OUT OF
trainval/QISHX5UKky0/50001 SO IT'S RIGHT UP IN THE HEAVENS
trainval/QISHX5UKky0/50002 IT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO BREATH
trainval/QISHX5UKky0/50003 YOU GET ALTITUDE SICKNESS
trainval/QISHX5UKky0/50004 THAT'S NOT THE WORST PART OF IT
trainval/QISHX5UKky0/50005 MANY MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED ON MT
trainval/QISHX5UKky0/50006 THE WATER IS COMPLETELY BLACK
trainval/QISHX5UKky0/50007 THE WATER IS MINUS 1
trainval/QISHX5UKky0/50008 AND I DON'T WHERE I GOT IT FROM BUT I WAS ABLE TO SOMEHOW PULL MYSELF UP AND AS
trainval/QISHX5UKky0/50009 THIS IS THE TIME TO SWIM WITH REAL HUMILITY
trainval/qItCBNzqdn8/50001 BAD GUY YOU BULLIED MY KID AND MADE HER CRY
trainval/qItCBNzqdn8/50002 I'D BEEN TAUGHT BY ALL MY CHILDHOOD HEROES
trainval/qItCBNzqdn8/50003 HULK HOGAN THE A TEAM REMEMBER MR
trainval/qItCBNzqdn8/50004 I DID WHAT ANY GOOD DAD WOULD DO
trainval/qItCBNzqdn8/50005 I'LL FORGIVE THAT KID
trainval/qItCBNzqdn8/50006 I'LL BE PERFECTLY HONEST WITH YOU
trainval/qItCBNzqdn8/50007 AND WE'VE TAKEN CARE OF IT BUT WE JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW SO YOU CAN HANDLE THINGS WHEN YOU GET HOME
trainval/qIVTKBeiabI/50001 END QUOTE THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT
trainval/QJ28IC63hlI/50001 AND ONE EIGHTH OF THAT POPULATION ABOUT 1 MILLION PEOPLE DIED WHEN A PATHOGEN WIPED OUT
trainval/QJ28IC63hlI/50002 WITHIN THIS MODEL SEEDS BECOME NON RENEWABLE RESOURCES INVENTIONS
trainval/QJ28IC63hlI/50003 AND THAT SAME COMPANY IN 2005 ACQUIRED THE WORLD'S LARGEST DEVELOPER AND GROWER OF
trainval/QJ28IC63hlI/50004 NOW ADD TO THIS RESEARCH FROM THE NGO BIOVERSITY INTERNATIONAL THAT SHOWS A NARROWING OF VARIETY IN
trainval/Qj4xf3U8dh8/50001 THESE MEN AND WOMEN DON'T HAVE TIME TO CHOKE OR FREEZE
trainval/Qj4xf3U8dh8/50002 AVIO STANDS FOR AVIATION AND PREP STANDS FOR PREPARATION
trainval/Qj4xf3U8dh8/50003 OR AS THE ACRONYM TELLS US ITS A PILOT RESILIENCE ENHANCING PROGRAM
trainval/Qj4xf3U8dh8/50004 THAT AWARENESS OF HOW TO STAY IN THE MOMENT CALM AND FOCUSED TO PERFORM OPTIMALLY
trainval/Qj4xf3U8dh8/50005 SO LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
trainval/qJ7A74Vx7YE/50001 AND I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT'S THE KEY TO ACHIEVING YOUR DREAM
trainval/qJ7A74Vx7YE/50002 ISN'T IT JUST ANOTHER FORM OF PLAY
trainval/qJ7A74Vx7YE/50003 THIS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IS OUR NEW BRAIN DRAIN
trainval/qJ7A74Vx7YE/50004 ADELAIDE INTRODUCED THE ADELAIDE FREE WI FI NETWORK THROUGHOUT THE CBD A FIRST FOR AUSTRALIA
trainval/qJ7A74Vx7YE/50005 WHY NOT TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES
trainval/qJ7A74Vx7YE/50006 AND I THINK TEDX IS REALLY THE PERFECT PLATFORM FOR US TO CHALLENGE OUR TECH INDUSTRY LEADERS TO SET AN ETHICAL
trainval/qJ7A74Vx7YE/50007 BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS INFANT DEVELOPMENT
trainval/QJORi5VO1F8/50001 NOW SHE'S THE FASTEST TYPIST SHE KNOWS
trainval/QjpNV6QjG1c/50001 IT'S NOT A SUITCASE
trainval/QjpNV6QjG1c/50002 AND OF COURSE MY FATHER WORKED HARD
trainval/qKlzdSH2X9w/50001 WHAT IF THERE'S A QUEUE TO GET IN
trainval/qKlzdSH2X9w/50002 YOU CAN'T RESERVE YOUR SEAT
trainval/qKlzdSH2X9w/50003 WE BETTER GET IN THAT QUEUE
trainval/qKlzdSH2X9w/50004 THAT'S GREAT OK NO WORRIES
trainval/qKlzdSH2X9w/50005 OK SO MAYBE ANOTHER TEN MINUTES EARLIER THAN THAT
trainval/qKlzdSH2X9w/50006 I'M ALSO VERY CURIOUS ABOUT ANXIETY
trainval/qKlzdSH2X9w/50007 I HAVE EXPERIENCED IT MYSELF AND I'VE WORKED WITH MANY MANY MANY ANXIOUS PEOPLE OVER THE
trainval/qKlzdSH2X9w/50008 SO YOU MAY WANT TO START READING ABOUT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT ABOUT CHILDHOOD
trainval/qKlzdSH2X9w/50009 ONCE WE GOT THERE AND SHE GOT OUT OF THE CAR A DIFFERENT ASHLEY
trainval/qKlzdSH2X9w/50010 I DID NOT MAKE THIS UP
trainval/qKlzdSH2X9w/50011 THIS IS NOT EXCITING ENOUGH
trainval/qKlzdSH2X9w/50012 AND ASHLEY HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO ME WHEN I WAS WORKING FOR WISH FOR A BRIGHTER FUTURE WHICH IS A
trainval/qKlzdSH2X9w/50013 SO WHEN WE GET OUT OF THE CAR PCHING
trainval/qKlzdSH2X9w/50015 AND YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/qKlzdSH2X9w/50016 OUR CHILDREN FIND STUFF AS WELL TO NUMB THEIR MEERKATS OUT
trainval/qKlzdSH2X9w/50017 AND NONE OF THAT IS GOOD STUFF EITHER
trainval/qKlzdSH2X9w/50019 THEY LOVE RHYTHM MEERKATS
trainval/qKlzdSH2X9w/50020 SO BECOME MEERKAT OBSERVERS OF YOURSELF AND OF OTHERS AND TAKE THE TROUBLE
trainval/qKmuMQT5E6Y/50001 SO TO BEGIN WITH FOCAL GLOW
trainval/qKmuMQT5E6Y/50002 AND YOU CAN IMAGINE A LOT MORE APPLICATIONS
trainval/qKmuMQT5E6Y/50003 THE PROBLEM IS THOUGH THAT I WANTED TO EXPLAIN TO YOU HOW THIS REALLY WORKS BUT I CAN HAVE FOUR OF THESE ON MY FINGER
trainval/qL7UlSA6rRk/50001 I'M A WOMEN THANKS TO GOD
trainval/qL7UlSA6rRk/50002 EXACTLY AS WE'RE DOING NOW
trainval/qL7UlSA6rRk/50003 ON MY WAY TO SESAME I BROKE THAT RULE AND LEFT IT AT HOME BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IN SESAME MY
trainval/qL7UlSA6rRk/50004 UPON TRAVELING TO ITALY TO WORK ON MY PH
trainval/qL7UlSA6rRk/50005 AND I ANSWERED WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT HIS RELIGION IF MY PH
trainval/qL7UlSA6rRk/50006 SO THEY START SHOULD WE CALL THE AMBULANCE
trainval/qL7UlSA6rRk/50007 SHOULD WE RUN
trainval/QLBtr2rOFkI/50001 I JUST LOVED IT SO DEARLY I WANTED TO PROTECT IT FOREVER
trainval/QLBtr2rOFkI/50002 WELL A CONCH FARMER CULTIVATING THE SEA LIKE THE FARMER TILLS THE LAND
trainval/QLBtr2rOFkI/50003 THAT'S RIGHT LESS THAN 1
trainval/QLBtr2rOFkI/50004 THAT'S A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TIME
trainval/QLBtr2rOFkI/50005 BUT REALLY THIS WAS A DROP IN THE BUCKET
trainval/QLBtr2rOFkI/50006 COULD THERE BE A LESSON THERE FOR US
trainval/QLBtr2rOFkI/50008 HE CAME FROM MEXICO
trainval/QLBtr2rOFkI/50009 WITH YEARS OF EXPERIENCE GROWING OYSTER PEARLS AND WITH MY KNOWLEDGE OF GROWING CONCH WE SET OUT TOGETHER
trainval/QLBtr2rOFkI/50010 GEMOLOGISTS EVERYWHERE WERE SO EXCITED BY THIS BREAKTHROUGH
trainval/QlyorcJ28UA/50001 AND OUT OF THAT FIELD CAMPAIGN WE'LL PROBABLY GET A FEW DOZEN PAPERS ON A FEW DOZEN PROCESSES OR MOLECULES
trainval/qm0isl11BfY/50001 I WAS CONSIDERED IMPURE AND FORBIDDEN FROM WORSHIPPING OR TOUCHING ANY OBJECT OF RELIGIOUS
trainval/Qm172DbaSbc/50001 GET TO THE ANSWER
trainval/Qm172DbaSbc/50002 HOW CAN WE ASK A BETTER QUESTION
trainval/Qm172DbaSbc/50003 THE DAY TO DAY STUFF YOU DO
trainval/Qm172DbaSbc/50004 I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS WE HAVE TO APPROACH CHANGE IN A BRAND NEW WAY
trainval/Qm172DbaSbc/50005 WE NEED TO KILL THINGS WE NEED TO ERADICATE THE STUFF THAT'S TOO COMPLEX THAT GETS IN OUR WAYS MEETINGS AND EMAILS SO WE CAN MAKE
trainval/Qm172DbaSbc/50006 AND THEY CAN DO IT FOR REALLY LONG TIME BEFORE THEY CAN FINALLY GET TO WHAT'S RIGHT ABOUT IT
trainval/Qm172DbaSbc/50007 I THINK IT'S GREAT TO QUESTION THINGS
trainval/Qm172DbaSbc/50008 WE'RE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE SOFT BEHAVIORAL THINGS
trainval/Qm172DbaSbc/50009 NOW THINK ABOUT IT
trainval/Qm172DbaSbc/50011 SUDDENLY HE GOT REALLY ENGAGED
trainval/Qm172DbaSbc/50012 AND HE PUT A BANANA ON TOP OF THE CAGE
trainval/Qm172DbaSbc/50013 MUST BE THERE FOR A REASON
trainval/Qm172DbaSbc/50014 WHEN IS ABE LINCOLN'S BIRTHDAY
trainval/Qm172DbaSbc/50015 ARE WE EMPOWERING PEOPLE
trainval/Qm172DbaSbc/50016 AND THAT'S HOW CHANGE AND INNOVATION WILL REALLY HAPPEN
trainval/qmnVdzzAuQk/50001 MOMENT IN A DOCTOR'S OFFICE WHEN HE WENT TO PRESCRIBE THE SAME MEDICATION THAT MY GRANDFATHER WAS ON AT THAT TIME IN ORDER
trainval/qNvDRuGK84I/50001 ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH CRISES ARE GLOBAL
trainval/qNvDRuGK84I/50002 THEY ALL NEEDED TO BE HOUSED IN A SAFE AND SECURE LOCATION IN THE CLOUD
trainval/qNvDRuGK84I/50003 NATIVE EYES ON NATIVE NAMES WE CALLED IT THE IDEA BEING WHO BEST TO TELL YOU WHO WAS IMPORTANT TO
trainval/qNvDRuGK84I/50004 NOW WHEN YOU'RE AN INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER AND YOU MAKE AN AMAZING DISCOVERY SUCH AS YOUR PRIME MINSTER CAN BE LINKED TO A
trainval/qNvDRuGK84I/50005 WE HAD TO CALM THEM DOWN
trainval/qNvDRuGK84I/50006 THEY THOUGHT THE STORY WAS GOING TO GET OUT
trainval/qNvDRuGK84I/50007 YOU CAN IMAGINE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THEY'D SPENT THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES MONEY SPENT ON THIS
trainval/qNvDRuGK84I/50008 SO I HAD TO BASICALLY SPEND THE LAST WEEK CALMING EVERYONE DOWN A BIT LIKE A GENERAL WHERE YOU'RE HOLDING YOUR TROOPS BACK
trainval/QogTFXqFhMw/50001 THEREFORE YOU GET OPTIMAL RESULTS WHEN YOU WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM
trainval/QogTFXqFhMw/50002 WRONG DIAGNOSES ARE MOSTLY CAUSED BY TUNNEL VISION
trainval/QogTFXqFhMw/50003 THE FIFTH AND FINAL STEP IS WHEN YOU'RE BACK HOME
trainval/QogTFXqFhMw/50004 YOU FOLLOW YOUR PRESCRIBED THERAPY AS A BASELINE AND SPEAK UP WHEN YOU THINK SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE
trainval/QogTFXqFhMw/50005 DON'T BE ONE OF THEM
trainval/QogTFXqFhMw/50006 ONE IN TWO HUNDRED PATIENTS ARE SEVERELY HARMED
trainval/QogTFXqFhMw/50007 THEY MAY LITERALLY GO BLIND
trainval/QOjVk3cQFB8/50001 THIS CREATES A VICIOUS CYCLE
trainval/QOjVk3cQFB8/50002 SOYA LECITHIN LOCUST BEAN GUM THE SALT SOLUTION THAT POULTRY
trainval/QOjVk3cQFB8/50003 WHY DID PEOPLE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE PRICES HE CHARGED
trainval/QOjVk3cQFB8/50004 BECAUSE UNLIKE THE KINDS OF CORN AND SOYBEANS WHICH ARE THE PRIMARY
trainval/QOjVk3cQFB8/50005 IT'S LIKE A CROSS BETWEEN A BEET AND A BROCCOLI RABE
trainval/QOjVk3cQFB8/50006 FOR THE FIRST FEW WEEKS AFTER I STARTED WORKING ON THE FARM I WAS SO TIRED THAT I WOULD DREAM THAT I WAS RIDING
trainval/QOjVk3cQFB8/50007 I THINK IT'S GREAT IT'S FANTASTIC
trainval/QOjVk3cQFB8/50008 SO LEARN ABOUT THIS HISTORY WHERE YOU FIT INTO IT AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
trainval/QOjVk3cQFB8/50009 AND DO WHAT YOU CAN TO MAKE THAT CHANGE HAPPEN
trainval/QOjVk3cQFB8/50010 AND THEN DO IT OVER AGAIN
trainval/QOjVk3cQFB8/50011 DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN
trainval/QoRZNSVpt3Q/50001 I DIDN'T TALK TO HER BUT SHE ALSO DIDN'T TALK TO ME
trainval/QoRZNSVpt3Q/50003 AND THE WAY WE TEND TO SOMETIMES WANT TO DEAL WITH THEM IS ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS
trainval/QoRZNSVpt3Q/50004 WE GET ALL OFFENDED THE RACE CARD
trainval/QoRZNSVpt3Q/50005 WE GET ALL OFFENDED AND WE TAKE IT PERSONAL THE MINUTE SOMETHING COMES UP
trainval/QoRZNSVpt3Q/50006 I'M GOING TO SORT OF PUT IT INTO A CONTEXT USING A STORY
trainval/QoRZNSVpt3Q/50007 SO SHE WENT
trainval/QoTSdOkjEVs/50001 COMPUTERS HAVE CHANGED THE LIVES OF US ALL IN THIS ROOM AND AROUND THE WORLD BUT I THINK THEY'VE CHANGED THE LIVES OF WE
trainval/QoTSdOkjEVs/50002 I LOVE STORIES
trainval/QoTSdOkjEVs/50003 IT HAD A SPEECH SYNTHESIZER
trainval/QoTSdOkjEVs/50004 ONE IS ANOTHER AMERICAN INVENTOR TED HENTER
trainval/QoTSdOkjEVs/50005 IT'S CALLED JAWS JOB ACCESS WITH SPEECH AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS
trainval/QoTSdOkjEVs/50006 I DIDN'T HAVE TO BE NICE TO PEOPLE
trainval/QoTSdOkjEVs/50007 I SLOWED IT DOWN FOR YOU
trainval/QoTSdOkjEVs/50008 I'M GOING TO ASK THAT WE PLAY IT AT THE SPEED I READ IT
trainval/QoTSdOkjEVs/50009 CAN WE PLAY THAT ONE
trainval/QoTSdOkjEVs/50010 MANY WEBSITES WE CAN'T READ USING JAWS AND THE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES
trainval/QoTSdOkjEVs/50011 FOR EXAMPLE AUSTRALIA LIKE ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE WORLD'S COUNTRIES HAS COPYRIGHT
trainval/QoTSdOkjEVs/50012 IN NO OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY ARE THERE MORE THAN A COUPLE OF THOUSAND
trainval/QoTSdOkjEVs/50013 WELL BECAUSE WE CAN'T TRANSPORT BOOKS ACROSS BORDERS THERE HAD TO BE SEPARATE VERSIONS READ IN ALL THE
trainval/QoTSdOkjEVs/50014 I WANT TO THANK HER TOO
trainval/QoTSdOkjEVs/50015 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/qp0HIF3SfI4/50001 AND IT'S THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE TO EVERYONE ELSE
trainval/qp0HIF3SfI4/50002 AND BY WHY I DON'T MEAN TO MAKE A PROFIT
trainval/qp0HIF3SfI4/50003 THAT'S A RESULT
trainval/qp0HIF3SfI4/50004 IT'S ALWAYS A RESULT
trainval/qp0HIF3SfI4/50005 THAT'S HOW MOST OF US COMMUNICATE
trainval/qp0HIF3SfI4/50008 THEY HAVE THE SAME ACCESS TO THE SAME TALENT THE SAME AGENCIES THE SAME CONSULTANTS THE SAME MEDIA
trainval/qp0HIF3SfI4/50009 NOT PSYCHOLOGY BIOLOGY
trainval/qp0HIF3SfI4/50010 THE BEST WE CAN MUSTER UP IS I DON'T KNOW
trainval/qp0HIF3SfI4/50011 IT JUST DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT
trainval/qp0HIF3SfI4/50013 MONEY WAS NO PROBLEM
trainval/qp0HIF3SfI4/50014 HE WANTED TO BE RICH AND HE WANTED TO BE FAMOUS
trainval/qp0HIF3SfI4/50015 HE WAS IN PURSUIT OF THE RICHES
trainval/qp0HIF3SfI4/50016 THAT'S HOW WE DESCRIBE THEM RIGHT
trainval/qp0HIF3SfI4/50017 THAT'S LIKE THAT GUT FEELING OH THEY JUST GET IT
trainval/qp0HIF3SfI4/50018 EVERYBODY WAS TRYING IT
trainval/qp0HIF3SfI4/50019 AS WE SAID BEFORE THE RECIPE FOR SUCCESS IS MONEY AND THE RIGHT PEOPLE AND THE RIGHT MARKET CONDITIONS
trainval/qp0HIF3SfI4/50020 I BELIEVE I BELIEVE I BELIEVE HE TOLD PEOPLE
trainval/qp0HIF3SfI4/50021 IT'S WHAT THEY BELIEVED ABOUT AMERICA THAT GOT THEM TO TRAVEL IN A BUS FOR EIGHT HOURS TO STAND IN THE SUN IN
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50001 AND TO LEAVE YOU WITH A QUOTE FROM THE POEM INVICTUS
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50002 BUT ALL KIDDING ASIDE IN MY LINE OF WORK WHAT I GET TO WORK WITH IS DATA ANALYTICS STATISTICS AND AD VARIATIONS
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50003 LET S TAKE A LOOK AT A FUN EXAMPLE HERE
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50004 IT WASN T UNTIL I STARTED WORKING ON A CAMPAIGN THAT I HAD A REALIZATION OF OTHERWISE
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50005 BUT RIGHT BEFORE THE CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED MY BOSS RECOMMENDED THAT WE TRY SOME AD VARIATIONS THAT WERE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN THE
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50006 AND THAT WAS
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50007 I HAD NO IDEA WHAT THE HELL I WAS DOING
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50008 AND THIS REALIZATION CAME OVER ME
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50009 IT WAS SIMPLY THIS
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50010 YOU DON T EITHER AND THAT S OKAY
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50011 SO THE PRIORITY NO
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50012 1 HAS TO BE LISTENING
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50013 OR I WOULD BUT I JUST DON T HAVE THE SKILLSET
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50014 WHEN IN ACTUALITY IT S NOT ABOUT THE RESOURCES YOU HAVE IT S ABOUT THE RESOURCEFULNESS OF YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50015 I STARTED LEARNING MARKETING TACTICS AND STRATEGIES THAT WAY
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50016 THAT S ACTUALLY HOW I GOT STARTED WITH MY CAREER
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50017 A GOOD EXAMPLE IS THIS
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50018 AND THAT S THE TIME LIMITATION
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50020 WE SAY OH I HAVE A JOB I HAVE KIDS I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND I HAVE SCHOOL THERE S JUST NOT ENOUGH TIME IN THE DAY TO DO
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50021 SO FOR ME I WOULD USE THE PROCRASTINATION LIMITATION
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50022 I WOULD SAY THINGS LIKE OH I LL GET TO IT ONE DAY
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50023 AND HERE S THE THING ABOUT THAT
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50024 THERE ARE SEVEN DAYS IN A WEEK AND SOMEDAY ISN T ONE OF THEM
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50025 ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE LIKE MYSELF WHO HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF WORKING AT HOME ON A DAILY BASIS MORE OFTEN THAN NOT
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50026 IS THIS WHERE YOU WANT TO BE
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50027 BUT HERE S THE THING
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50028 IF YOU WANT SOMETHING IN LIFE YOU HAVE TO RISK IT TO GET THE BISCUIT
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50029 IT LL SELDOM FALL ON YOUR LAP THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFETIME
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50030 SO IF YOU RE WAITING I M SORRY TO SAY YOU'RE GOING TO WAIT A LOT LONGER
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50031 THEN AFTER MONTHS AND MONTHS OF GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH THEM THROUGH EMAIL GIVING THEM FREE WRITING CONTENT
trainval/qP2W2k3L1Ow/50032 IT S NOT THAT I AM MY GREATEST OPPOSITION I M ALSO MY GREATEST ALLY
trainval/QPC5SP2SFu8/50001 HOW DOES THAT WORK
trainval/QPC5SP2SFu8/50002 IT REMOVES CARBON DIOXIDE FROM THE AIR
trainval/QPC5SP2SFu8/50003 IN FACT YOU GET MORE BANG FOR YOUR BUCK
trainval/QPiaadMporw/50001 WE SEE IT IN THE CARIBBEAN
trainval/QPiaadMporw/50002 TWO TRILLION A YEAR
trainval/QPiaadMporw/50003 SO THIS CYBER SEA WHICH WE KNOW ENDLESSLY IS THE FUNDAMENTAL PIECE OF RADICAL
trainval/QPiaadMporw/50004 SOPHISTICATED COMMUNICATIONS SWEEP
trainval/QPiaadMporw/50005 WE WILL NEED THE APPLICATION OF MILITARY FORCE
trainval/QPiaadMporw/50006 WHEN WE DO IT WE MUST DO IT WELL AND COMPETENTLY
trainval/QPiaadMporw/50007 MULTIPLY THIS BY 400000 PATIENT TREATMENTS THIS PRIVATE PUBLIC COLLABORATION
trainval/QPiaadMporw/50008 IT SHOWS ROLE MODELS TO YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN ABOUT FITNESS AND ABOUT LIFE THAT I
trainval/QPiaadMporw/50009 NOW WE ARE ALSO TEACHING THEM COMBAT SKILLS OF COURSE BUT I WOULD ARGUE OPEN SOURCE
trainval/QPiaadMporw/50010 WHY DO WE WANT TO BE INVOLVED
trainval/QPiaadMporw/50011 WIKIPEDIA EVERY DAY IS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE INPUTTING INFORMATION
trainval/QpmsftF2We4/50001 IT'S STORY WE ALL KNOW
trainval/QpmsftF2We4/50002 CYRUS KING OF THE PERSIANS HAS ENTERED BABYLON WITHOUT A FIGHT THE GREAT EMPIRE OF BABYLON
trainval/QpmsftF2We4/50003 SO THE HYPERBOLE IS NOT ACTUALLY SURPRISING
trainval/QpmsftF2We4/50004 AND THEY'LL BE ABLE TO RESTORE THEIR ALTARS AND TO WORSHIP THEIR GODS IN THEIR OWN
trainval/QpmsftF2We4/50005 GO UP AALEH
trainval/QpmsftF2We4/50007 AND THE CYRUS CYLINDER COMES BACK INTO PUBLIC VIEW AND THE TEXT OF THIS AS A
trainval/QpmsftF2We4/50008 SO WHEN THE BRITISH MUSEUM AND TEHRAN NATIONAL MUSUEM COOPERATE AND WORK TOGETHER AS WE'VE BEEN DOING
trainval/QpmsftF2We4/50009 IS IRAN STILL TO BE THE DEFENDER OF THE OPPRESSED
trainval/QpmsftF2We4/50010 THE RIGHT OF PEOPLES TO LIVE TOGETHER IN THE SAME STATE WORSHIPING DIFFERENTLY FREELY A
trainval/QQ0K98XDvds/50001 I DON'T BELIEVE THAT COMPUTERS ARE GOING TO BECOME SUPER BRILLIANT AND TURN US
trainval/qQDC7c2I8l8/50001 AS THE TIME PASSED I BEGAN TO ASK MYSELF
trainval/qQDC7c2I8l8/50002 I FOUND THAT EMPOWERMENT THROUGH SELF COMPASSION
trainval/qQDC7c2I8l8/50003 HUMANS TEND TO EXAGGERATE THEIR FAILURES AND CRITICIZE THEMSELVES MORE
trainval/qQDC7c2I8l8/50004 AS A RESULT THE SECOND COMPONENT IS COMMON HUMANITY WHICH INVOLVES ELIMINATING THE MENTALITY
trainval/qQDC7c2I8l8/50005 THE THIRD COMPONENT IS MINDFULNESS
trainval/qQDC7c2I8l8/50006 YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER ALL THE FACTORS IN ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES BEFORE CONSIDERING YOURSELF A FAILURE IN COMPARISON TO
trainval/qQDC7c2I8l8/50007 DEVELOPING THESE THREE COMPONENTS OF SELF COMPASSION HAS SHOWN TO BE IMMENSELY BENEFICIAL AS MENTIONED BY
trainval/qQDC7c2I8l8/50008 SHE STAYED TRUE TO WHO SHE WAS NO MATTER WHAT THE WHOLE WORLD WAS TELLING HER SHE WAS
trainval/qQDC7c2I8l8/50009 THEY COULDN'T SEE THE PERSON I TRULY WAS
trainval/qQDC7c2I8l8/50010 HOWEVER IF WE FIND OURSELVES BEING THE VICTIMS OF SUCH LABELS REMEMBER THAT WE DO HAVE THE POWER TO
trainval/qQDC7c2I8l8/50011 HUMILIATION IS AN EMOTION FELT BY EVERY SINGLE PERSON NO MATTER THEIR RACE THEIR
trainval/qQIwTWJSd2I/50001 I'VE SPENT MOST OF MY CAREER RESEARCHING THESE PROGRAMS
trainval/qQIwTWJSd2I/50002 I'VE TALKED TO A LOT OF DIRECTORS OF STATE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES ABOUT THESE ISSUES A LOT OF LEGISLATORS ABOUT THESE ISSUES
trainval/qQIwTWJSd2I/50003 WHEN LEGISLATORS AND OTHERS THINK ABOUT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WHAT THEY FIRST OF ALL THINK ABOUT ARE BUSINESS TAX
trainval/qQIwTWJSd2I/50004 THEY HAND OUT ALL KINDS OF BUSINESS TAX BREAKS
trainval/qQIwTWJSd2I/50005 NOW THOSE PROGRAMS CAN MAKE SENSE IF THEY IN FACT INDUCE NEW LOCATION DECISIONS AND THE WAY THEY CAN
trainval/qQIwTWJSd2I/50006 IT'S A SOMEWHAT MORE INDIRECT WAY
trainval/qQIwTWJSd2I/50007 SO WHEN YOU LOOK FOR EXAMPLE AT METROPOLITAN AREAS SUCH AS THE BOSTON AREA MINNEAPOLIS ST
trainval/qQIwTWJSd2I/50008 IT'S NOT EXACTLY A LOW COST PROPOSITION
trainval/qQIwTWJSd2I/50009 ANOTHER OBJECTION YOU SOMETIMES HEAR TO INVEST IN EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS IS CONCERN
trainval/qQIwTWJSd2I/50010 AND SO THEY'LL BOTH UNDER INVEST BECAUSE EVERYONE'S GOING TO MOVE OUT
trainval/qQIwTWJSd2I/50011 SO IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT IT WOULD COST IF EVERY STATE GOVERNMENT
trainval/qQIwTWJSd2I/50012 SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN INVESTMENT THAT IN TERMS OF IMPACTS ON THE STATE ECONOMY IS
trainval/qQIwTWJSd2I/50013 THAT IS THE NOTION OF INVESTMENT
trainval/qQIwTWJSd2I/50014 YOU SACRIFICE NOW FOR A RETURN LATER
trainval/qQIwTWJSd2I/50015 THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO PAY ME AS GOOD WAGES
trainval/qQIwTWJSd2I/50016 SO CLEARLY THE PRODUCTIVITY OF FIRMS IN SILICON VALLEY HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE SKILLS NOT ONLY OF THE WORKERS AT
trainval/qqNLSZ6SSSc/50001 IN THESE PAGES HE WROTE THE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTAL PHRASE OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHY
trainval/qqNLSZ6SSSc/50002 THEY DO THINGS THAT MOST PEOPLE THINK ARE IMPOSSIBLE
trainval/qqNLSZ6SSSc/50003 THERE IS PEOPLE DOING AMAZING THINGS WE DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT
trainval/qQSPUXPVlos/50001 NOW OF COURSE THERE'S OTHER WAYS TO DEAL WITH THAT
trainval/qQSPUXPVlos/50002 AND SO THAT SPIRIT LIVES ON
trainval/qQSPUXPVlos/50003 IT TAKES A SHORT TIME TO RUIN LOVE
trainval/qQSPUXPVlos/50004 REMAKING IT WOULD MEAN TWO THINGS
trainval/qQSPUXPVlos/50005 I DREAM OF IT
trainval/qQSPUXPVlos/50006 I BELIEVE IT'S POSSIBLE
trainval/qrNDkRHAA4E/50001 IT'S TOO HARD
trainval/qrNDkRHAA4E/50002 I'M NOT INTERESTED IN THEM
trainval/qS7zAkwAOYg/50001 MOST OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HUMAN LIFE WE KNOW FROM ASKING PEOPLE TO REMEMBER THE
trainval/qS7zAkwAOYg/50002 THEY ALL FINISHED COLLEGE DURING WORLD WAR II AND THEN MOST WENT OFF TO SERVE IN THE WAR
trainval/qS7zAkwAOYg/50003 AND WHEN ABOUT A DECADE AGO WE FINALLY ASKED THE WIVES IF THEY WOULD JOIN US AS MEMBERS OF THE STUDY
trainval/qS7zAkwAOYg/50004 THE PEOPLE WHO WERE THE MOST SATISFIED IN THEIR RELATIONSHIPS AT AGE 50 WERE THE HEALTHIEST
trainval/qS7zAkwAOYg/50005 BUT OVER AND OVER OVER THESE 75 YEARS OUR STUDY HAS SHOWN THAT THE PEOPLE WHO FARED THE
trainval/qS7zAkwAOYg/50006 ONCE WE HAD FOLLOWED OUR MEN ALL THE WAY INTO THEIR 80S WE WANTED TO LOOK BACK AT THEM AT
trainval/Qs9m8obl0AY/50001 YEARS LATER AFTER HIS PHYSICAL WOUNDS HAD HEALED AND HE'D RETURNED HOME HE RARELY SPOKE OF HIS
trainval/Qs9m8obl0AY/50002 INITIALLY IT WAS A DAUNTING PROCESS FOR THE SERVICE MEMBER BUT EVENTUALLY HE BEGAN TO THINK OF BFIB AS THE MASK
trainval/QSfFattg8N0/50001 YOU WERE RUBBISH
trainval/QSfFattg8N0/50004 YOU THINK WHY ARE WE DESIGNED THAT WAY
trainval/QSfFattg8N0/50006 IT CAN BE ANY TYPE OF CHALLENGE
trainval/QSfFattg8N0/50007 NO THAT'S WRONG
trainval/QSfFattg8N0/50008 A RABBIT IN THE HEADLIGHTS
trainval/QSfFattg8N0/50009 WHAT'S KIND OF INTERESTING ABOUT THAT IS WHEN THE BRAIN IS INHIBITED IT ALSO INHIBITS
trainval/QSfFattg8N0/50010 YOU GO DEAF
trainval/QSfFattg8N0/50011 WHAT IS THE BIOLOGICAL CONTEXT FROM WHICH THOUGHT EMERGES
trainval/QSfFattg8N0/50012 IN THE CENTER OF THE CHEST
trainval/qSTStSwyBWc/50001 I GREW UP POOR BUT I FIT IN
trainval/qSTStSwyBWc/50002 I HAVE MY HEALTH
trainval/qSTStSwyBWc/50003 DUN SHE GAVE ME 5 DOLLARS IN GAS MONEY TO GET HOME FROM HIGH SCHOOL ONE DAY
trainval/qSTStSwyBWc/50004 DUN SAW ME THROUGH MY ENTIRE COLLEGE APPLICATION PROCESS
trainval/qSTStSwyBWc/50005 SHE SAW SOMETHING IN ME THAT I WASN'T ABLE TO SEE IN MYSELF
trainval/qSTStSwyBWc/50006 I WAS SITTING IN CLASS WITH DR
trainval/qSTStSwyBWc/50007 CHARLES DERRY WHO'S A VERY REVERED PERSON IN OUR FILM WORLD
trainval/qSTStSwyBWc/50008 AND I THANK HIM FOR THAT
trainval/qSTStSwyBWc/50009 WE'RE DOING A TEDX
trainval/qSTStSwyBWc/50010 WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT
trainval/qSTStSwyBWc/50011 I HOPE I GET TO CONTINUE TO MAKE FILMS
trainval/Qt1RPkbF4o4/50001 BUT THEY'LL HAVE INDIVIDUAL LEARNING THAT THEY'LL TAKE AWAY ON AREAS WHERE THEY NEED TO IMPROVE TO
trainval/Qt1RPkbF4o4/50002 SO WHY DO WE USE ANALOGS
trainval/Qt1RPkbF4o4/50003 SO I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU ABOUT AN ANALOG THAT I PARTICIPATED IN WITH NASA
trainval/Qt1RPkbF4o4/50004 YOU KNOW NASA IS PLANNING TO GO TO THE SURFACE OF A BODY SOMEWHERE IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
trainval/Qt1RPkbF4o4/50005 AND ANALOGS ARE ONE OF THE WAYS WE DO THIS
trainval/Qt1RPkbF4o4/50006 SO WE WENT OUT TO TEST THESE HYPOTHESES ABOUT HOW TO ACTUALLY WORK AT THE ASTEROID
trainval/Qt1RPkbF4o4/50007 SO THEN WE TRIED THE JET PACKS
trainval/Qt1RPkbF4o4/50008 JET PACKS RIGHT
trainval/Qt1RPkbF4o4/50009 HOW COOL IS THAT
trainval/Qt1RPkbF4o4/50010 SO HOWEVER COOL THEY WERE WE REALIZED THAT MAYBE JET PACKS ARE ONLY GOOD FOR A SAFETY MEASURE
trainval/Qt1RPkbF4o4/50011 YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AN ANALOG
trainval/Qt1RPkbF4o4/50012 IF WE WERE WORKING WITH ANOTHER CREW MEMBER THEY COULD LOOK OUT FOR BOTH OF US AT THE SAME TIME
trainval/Qt1RPkbF4o4/50013 THAT MASS OF THAT VEHICLE WOULD HOLD US IN PLACE
trainval/Qt1RPkbF4o4/50014 SO NOW THE QUESTION BECOMES
trainval/Qt1RPkbF4o4/50015 THAT'S LEFT FOR ANOTHER ANALOG
trainval/Qt1RPkbF4o4/50016 HAVE YOU PUT IT INTO PLACE OR IS IT JUST WRITTEN UP IN A DOCUMENT
trainval/Qt1RPkbF4o4/50017 CONSIDER RUNNING AN AUTHENTIC DRILL TO SEE IF YOUR TEN YEAR OLD IS REALLY READY TO HELP YOU IF YOU ARE
trainval/Qt1RPkbF4o4/50018 OR IF YOUR CO WORKERS KNOW HOW TO USE THE AD OR OTHER EQUIPMENT YOU HAVE
trainval/qtAZbSZESOU/50001 WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT I HAVE TO LIVE UP TO MY OWN MISTAKES
trainval/qtAZbSZESOU/50002 THERE WAS ANOTHER OPTION
trainval/qtcWebAYmKY/50001 AND EVERY DAY EVERY DAY WE WAKE UP WITH THE RULE OF THE MILITIAS AND
trainval/qtcWebAYmKY/50002 OUR SOCIETY SHAPED BY A REVOLUTIONARY MINDSET BECAME MORE POLARIZED AND HAS
trainval/qtcWebAYmKY/50003 WHY DOES OUR SOCIETY CONTINUE TO BE POLARIZED AND DOMINATED
trainval/qtcWebAYmKY/50004 MAY WE ALL BE GRANTED A GRACE OF MERCY
trainval/qtOIh93Hvuw/50001 WHERE IS CNN
trainval/qtOIh93Hvuw/50002 AND THESE COMPANIES THAT ISSUE SECURITY CERTIFICATES
trainval/qtOIh93Hvuw/50003 THAT HEY I'M ON THE SECURE INTERNET
trainval/qtOIh93Hvuw/50004 YOU ARE TALKING TO THE RIGHT FACEBOOK
trainval/qtOIh93Hvuw/50005 AND PEOPLE JUST BLINDLY TRUST THAT COMPANY
trainval/qtOIh93Hvuw/50006 WE WANT IT TO BE TRANSPARENT
trainval/qtOIh93Hvuw/50007 WE WANT AN INTERNET THAT IS FAIR
trainval/qtOIh93Hvuw/50008 FOR THAT I'M PROPOSING TWO REQUIREMENTS
trainval/qtOIh93Hvuw/50009 ONE THERE CAN BE NO MIDDLE MAN
trainval/qtOIh93Hvuw/50010 THE MAIN THING THAT IT DOES IS THAT IT GIVES THE POWER BACK TO THE PEOPLE
trainval/qtOIh93Hvuw/50011 THIS PRIVATE KEY IS SO SECURE THAT IF SOMEONE WANTS TO RANDOMLY GUESS IT OR CRACK IT THEY WOULD NEED
trainval/qtOIh93Hvuw/50012 YOU DON'T NEED PASSWORDS ANYMORE
trainval/qtOIh93Hvuw/50013 YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN STORAGE SPACE ONLINE
trainval/qtOIh93Hvuw/50014 ONCE THAT HAPPENS AND I WANT TO TALK TO A FRIEND I WANT TO SEND A MASSAGE THAT COMMUNICATION IS BETWEEN
trainval/qtOIh93Hvuw/50015 NOT ANY OTHER COMPANY
trainval/qtOIh93Hvuw/50016 HE DIDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH ANY COMPANY AT ALL
trainval/qty0NjF3pdQ/50001 AND SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE WE DECIDED WE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE ANY TOPIC BE OFF LIMITS FOR DISCUSSION EVEN IF
trainval/qty0NjF3pdQ/50002 IT IS SO EASY TO GET EMOTIONALLY FIRED UP ABOUT ISSUES THAT WE'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT AND WE CAN LET OUR EGO
trainval/qty0NjF3pdQ/50003 I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY LAURAN WOULD CHOOSE TO HAVE THEM PARTICIPATE IN THAT WAY AND I ASSUMED IT WASN'T A CHOICE THAT THE BOYS MADE FOR
trainval/qty0NjF3pdQ/50004 I COULD TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT AND JUST CHOOSE NOT TO SAY ANYTHING TO HER AND INSTEAD JUST KIND OF SIMMER IN
trainval/qty0NjF3pdQ/50005 AND FRANKLY MY ASSUMPTIONS WERE WRONG
trainval/qty0NjF3pdQ/50006 BUT BY ASKING LAURAN QUESTIONS IT ALLOWED US TO USE DIALOGUE TO GET TO A PLACE OF TRUE UNDERSTANDING
trainval/qty0NjF3pdQ/50007 AND YOU'RE RIGHT THERE WERE SOME TERRIBLE THINGS THAT CAME OUT DURING THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SO MUCH SO THAT I ALMOST
trainval/qu7ZpWecIS8/50001 THE MEDIA LANDSCAPE IN THE 20TH CENTURY WAS VERY GOOD AT HELPING PEOPLE CONSUME AND WE GOT AS A
trainval/qu7ZpWecIS8/50002 IT IS ONE OF THE CURIOSITIES OF OUR HISTORICAL ERA THAT EVEN AS COGNITIVE SURPLUS IS
trainval/qu7ZpWecIS8/50003 SHE WOULD POST THEM
trainval/QuaIMgzIOn8/50001 AND IT ALL COMES FLOODING BACK TO ME
trainval/QuaIMgzIOn8/50002 MY LEG NEVER GREW BACK
trainval/QuaIMgzIOn8/50003 TAKE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ROOM
trainval/QuaIMgzIOn8/50004 I'M NOT AN AMPUTEE
trainval/QuaIMgzIOn8/50005 AND I GO THROUGH THIS AND I SAY TO MYSELF OH MY GOSH
trainval/QuaIMgzIOn8/50006 ADAM LOOK LOOK
trainval/QuaIMgzIOn8/50007 LOOK AT THIS BROCHURE
trainval/QuaIMgzIOn8/50008 I WANTED TO GET TO THAT POINT
trainval/QuaIMgzIOn8/50009 I TOLD ADAM WE HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE
trainval/QuaIMgzIOn8/50010 IT'S ON RERUN TONIGHT
trainval/QuaIMgzIOn8/50011 I'M BRINGING PIZZA
trainval/QuaIMgzIOn8/50012 WHAT DO YOU WANT ON IT
trainval/QuaIMgzIOn8/50013 CHEESE CHEESE AND MORE CHEESE PLEASE
trainval/QuaIMgzIOn8/50014 THAT'S THERE COMFORT
trainval/QuaIMgzIOn8/50015 DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO CUT OFF THE REST OF YOUR LEG
trainval/QuaIMgzIOn8/50016 WE WON'T BE AND THAT'S OK
trainval/quJdL9ggETI/50001 NOW WHY WOULD WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME ON SOMETHING SO SMALL
trainval/quJdL9ggETI/50002 NOW THIS WAS A SCENARIO THAT THE TEAM NEVER EVEN TOOK INTO ACCOUNT BEFORE
trainval/quJdL9ggETI/50003 ONLY 20 PERCENT OF PEOPLE SENT THE MESSAGE TO THEIR FRIEND
trainval/quJdL9ggETI/50004 IT'S BOTH ART AND SCIENCE
trainval/quJdL9ggETI/50005 NETWORKS BROADCAST IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS COMBINED
trainval/quJdL9ggETI/50006 WE USE OUR PRODUCTS IN NON ENGLISH LANGUAGES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WORK JUST AS WELL
trainval/quJdL9ggETI/50007 IT IS AFTER ALL THEIR CONTENT
trainval/QUL0eSQtV8c/50001 THEN WE HAD THE TOPIC OF THE SEAWEED THE BLADDERWRACK IN 2011
trainval/QUL0eSQtV8c/50002 AS YOU KNOW THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW LATVIA OGRE IS NOWHERE NEAR THE
trainval/QUL0eSQtV8c/50003 THEN I SWITCHED TO A COMPLETELY UNRELATED FIELD
trainval/QUL0eSQtV8c/50004 OF PEOPLE WATCHING WHAT IS GOING ON STAGE
trainval/QUUFbS1hBtw/50001 IT'S MAGICAL THING
trainval/qvEU36woPB8/50001 HE ALSO HAD THE WONDERFUL FEAST OF DANCING AND FOOD AND IT WAS HIS TURN TO STAND IN
trainval/qVJBlW0j6tw/50001 GOOD MORNING EVERYONE
trainval/qVJBlW0j6tw/50002 AH THERE WE GO
trainval/qVJBlW0j6tw/50003 VIOLENCE IS EVERYWHERE
trainval/qVJBlW0j6tw/50004 AND IT'S OK AND WHEN I FEEL LIKE RUBBISH I'M REALLY GOING TO EMBRACE THAT RUBBISH FEELING I'M PROBABLY GOING TO GET INTO BED I'M GOING TO WATCH
trainval/qVJBlW0j6tw/50005 I REMEMBER ONE YOUNG MAN
trainval/qVJBlW0j6tw/50006 AND HE WAS ANGRY
trainval/QVSqg1CRvl0/50001 RESOLUTION'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH THE IMAGE IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH
trainval/QVSqg1CRvl0/50002 THE CORRELATIONS WERE INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY REALIZED THAT WHEN TEMPERATURE ROSE PEOPLE WERE GETTING MORE ATTACKS
trainval/QVSqg1CRvl0/50003 THEY REALIZED THAT ALONG MAIN TRANSPORTATION CORRIDORS PEOPLE WERE GETTING MORE ATTACKS
trainval/QW8muMXpkRg/50001 WELL ALL THESE TALKS ON TED
trainval/QWN5xhV6v1U/50001 RAISE YOUR HANDS
trainval/QWN5xhV6v1U/50002 SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS LIKE YOU WORK HARD EVERY DAY RIGHT
trainval/QWN5xhV6v1U/50003 HE USED TO SAY TO ME
trainval/qx6KKSeT4qw/50001 BUT I HAD AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE OF VISITING GOTTFRIED SCHLAUG AND IT WAS THIS THAT I WAS AT A CROSSROADS IN MY LIFE
trainval/qx6KKSeT4qw/50002 I HAD JUST COMPLETED MY UNDERGRADUATE AND I WAS WORKING AS A RESEARCH ASSISTANT AT THE LAB OF DENNIS SELKOE
trainval/qx6KKSeT4qw/50003 I WANTED TO BECOME A SURGEON
trainval/qx6KKSeT4qw/50004 I WANTED TO BECOME THAT KIND OF RED CROSS DOCTOR THAT DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS
trainval/qx6KKSeT4qw/50005 AND THAT AFTERNOON I HAD TO ASK HIM HOW WAS IT FOR YOU MAKING THAT DECISION
trainval/qx6KKSeT4qw/50006 AND IT WAS A DREAM
trainval/qx6KKSeT4qw/50007 AND INSPIRED BY WHAT I LEARNED FROM NATHANIEL I STARTED AN ORGANIZATION ON SKID ROW OF MUSICIANS CALLED STREET SYMPHONY
trainval/qx6KKSeT4qw/50008 SUDDENLY WHAT WE'RE FINDING WITH THESE CONCERTS AWAY FROM THE STAGE AWAY FROM THE FOOTLIGHTS OUT
trainval/qx6KKSeT4qw/50009 THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL QUOTE BY THE ROMANTIC GERMAN COMPOSER ROBERT SCHUMANN WHO SAID TO SEND
trainval/QxkxcsrveLw/50001 AND ALL DAY SHE WALKED AROUND ONLY IN HER UNDERWEAR
trainval/QxkxcsrveLw/50002 WHEN I ASKED WHO IS THAT
trainval/QxkxcsrveLw/50003 THIS IS THE DREAM OF THE AFRICAN GIRL
trainval/QxkxcsrveLw/50005 AND WHEN THE GIRLS STARTED ENGAGING HIM HE WAS VERY HOSTILE TOWARDS THEM
trainval/qxmEpmCtM3o/50001 I WAS GETTING OUTSIDE MY COMFORT ZONE I WAS CALLING UPON MY RESILIENCE AND I WAS FINDING
trainval/qxmEpmCtM3o/50002 SO ONE DAY A CALL CAME IN FOR A FIRE AND SURE ENOUGH WHEN MY ENGINE GROUP PULLED UP THERE WAS BLACK SMOKE BILLOWING
trainval/qxmEpmCtM3o/50003 AND I WAS WITH A BIG GUY NAMED SKIP AND HE WAS ON THE NOZZLE AND I WAS RIGHT BEHIND AND IT
trainval/qxmEpmCtM3o/50004 NOW THE ANSWER BEGAN TO COME WHEN A FRIEND OF MINE LAMENTED TO ME THAT HER YOUNG DAUGHTER WAS A BIG SCAREDY CAT
trainval/qxmEpmCtM3o/50005 MOST OF WHAT THEY SAID TO HER WHEN SHE WAS OUTSIDE BEGAN WITH BE CAREFUL WATCH OUT
trainval/qxmEpmCtM3o/50006 BUT THE PROBLEM IS WHEN FEAR IS THE PRIMARY REACTION THAT WE TEACH AND ENCOURAGE IN GIRLS WHENEVER
trainval/Qy5A8dVYU3k/50001 MAYBE THESE PEOPLE ARE RIGHT
trainval/Qy5A8dVYU3k/50002 IT WOULD MAKE A LOT OF SENSE
trainval/Qy5A8dVYU3k/50003 WE LIVE LONGER
trainval/qyecmU5r9SI/50001 AND IT IS YOUR MINDSET
trainval/qyecmU5r9SI/50002 WHETHER I WAS A GOOD PERSON OR A BAD PERSON
trainval/qyecmU5r9SI/50003 SO AGAIN I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SCALE IS FOR YOU BUT THINK ABOUT RETRAINING YOUR MIND TO DEFINE SUCCESS IN ANOTHER
trainval/qyecmU5r9SI/50004 WE NEED OTHER PEOPLE
trainval/qyecmU5r9SI/50005 I USED MY FAITH MY FRIENDS MY FAMILY
trainval/qyecmU5r9SI/50006 THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO ENGAGE IN
trainval/qyecmU5r9SI/50007 THE OTHER AREA WAS MY VIEW OF FAILURE
trainval/qyecmU5r9SI/50008 BUT FAILURE IS NOTHING MORE THAN A SETBACK
trainval/qYfEYvo96Hg/50001 YOU HAVE TO PLACE YOUR FOOT CAREFULLY
trainval/qYfEYvo96Hg/50002 YOU HAVE TO CONCENTRATE
trainval/qYfEYvo96Hg/50003 I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT TED
trainval/qYfEYvo96Hg/50004 I'M STILL WAITING FOR
trainval/qYfEYvo96Hg/50005 LET'S HOPE IT HAPPENS BEFORE I'M GONE
trainval/QYGO5tepBLY/50001 NOTHING THAT WE'VE EVER DONE OR CONCEIVED OF IN THE PAST HAS BEEN ABLE TO RECONCILE THESE TWO CONFLICTING
trainval/QYGO5tepBLY/50002 THE SECOND MONTH YOU DO THE SAME THING
trainval/qykDS2AXKIU/50001 A PLACE IN WHICH WE COME TOGETHER TO BRING ALL OUR DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES AND
trainval/qykSnLkPM7E/50001 SO WHAT I DID INSTEAD IS I TOOK THE AVERAGE OF THE STORIES OF MANY SENSITIVE PEOPLE AND
trainval/qykSnLkPM7E/50002 AS IT TURNS OUT OUR SOCIETY CAN'T MAKE UP ITS MIND
trainval/qykSnLkPM7E/50003 AS I WALKED I FELT LIKE THE ASYMMETRICAL TREES BENT A
trainval/qykSnLkPM7E/50004 RUNNERS ON THE OTHER HAND DIDN'T NOTICE IT
trainval/qykSnLkPM7E/50005 SO I LIKE TO DO THIS PRAYER CALLED DHIKR WHICH INVOLVES THE REPETITION OF
trainval/qykSnLkPM7E/50006 AND IT DIDN'T SUBSIDE UNTIL I WAS ABLE TO NAME IT I WAS ABLE TO DESCRIBE IT I WAS ABLE TO
trainval/qykSnLkPM7E/50007 OKAY SO THAT WASN'T SO SIMPLE
trainval/qYvXkSbqlBk/50001 LET ME DEAL IN A BIT MORE DETAIL WITH EXTROVERSION BECAUSE IT'S CONSEQUENTIAL AND IT'S
trainval/qYvXkSbqlBk/50002 THEY ALL GATHER TOGETHER
trainval/qYvXkSbqlBk/50003 AND I'VE SEEN YOU
trainval/qYvXkSbqlBk/50004 THE INTROVERTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO SPEND TIME IN THE QUIET SPACES UP ON THE SECOND FLOOR WHERE THEY ARE ABLE
trainval/qYvXkSbqlBk/50005 IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE KNOW THIS
trainval/qYvXkSbqlBk/50006 AND WE ENACT THOSE FREE TRAITS
trainval/qYvXkSbqlBk/50007 I'M A PROFESSOR
trainval/qYvXkSbqlBk/50008 THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING NOW
trainval/qywLsqI5YeY/50001 IN BOTH OF THESE CASES THE BULLYING WAS VERY EXPLICIT
trainval/qywLsqI5YeY/50002 WHAT COULD BE DONE ABOUT IT
trainval/Qz6V5OA4ymA/50001 MAYBE WE CAN JUST SAY
trainval/Qz6V5OA4ymA/50002 NO IT'S NOT POSSIBLE
trainval/Qz6V5OA4ymA/50003 YOU HAVE EVERY BOAT THAT GOES OUT EVERY BOAT THAT COMES IN EVERY CHANGE THAT WAS MADE IN THE CITY
trainval/Qz6V5OA4ymA/50004 AND THIS GIANT INFORMATION SYSTEM CAN BE SEARCHED IN MANY WAYS
trainval/Qz6V5OA4ymA/50005 THIS IS PRETTY AMAZING
trainval/Qz6V5OA4ymA/50007 THAT WILL NOT GUARANTEE THAT WE ACTUALLY CONVERGE TOWARD A SINGLE STORY OF VENICE
trainval/qzR62JJCMBQ/50001 IN FACT WE SPEND MORE TIME LOOKING AFTER OUR CARS OUR CLOTHES AND OUR HAIR THAN WE OKAY MAYBE NOT OUR
trainval/qzR62JJCMBQ/50002 THE PACE OF LIFE IS OFTEN FRANTIC OUR MINDS ARE ALWAYS BUSY AND WE'RE ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING
trainval/qzR62JJCMBQ/50003 THE RESULT OF COURSE IS THAT WE GET STRESSED
trainval/qzR62JJCMBQ/50004 WE MISS OUT ON THE THINGS THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO US AND THE CRAZY THING IS THAT EVERYBODY JUST ASSUMES
trainval/qzR62JJCMBQ/50005 EVERY TIME I SORT OF PUSHED ONE DOWN ANOTHER ONE WOULD POP BACK UP AGAIN
trainval/qzR62JJCMBQ/50006 SOME PEOPLE HIT THE BOTTLE START TAKING MEDICATION
trainval/qzR62JJCMBQ/50007 WELL OBVIOUSLY IT CHANGED THINGS
trainval/qzR62JJCMBQ/50008 AND THE BEAUTY OF IT IS THAT EVEN THOUGH IT NEED ONLY TAKE ABOUT 10 MINUTES A DAY IT IMPACTS OUR
trainval/qzR62JJCMBQ/50009 WE NEED AN EXERCISE
trainval/qzR62JJCMBQ/50010 THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT MEDITATION IS
trainval/qzR62JJCMBQ/50011 EQUALLY IF I RELAX TOO MUCH TALKING TO YOU THERE'S NO WAY I CAN FOCUS ON THE BALLS
trainval/qzR62JJCMBQ/50012 I'M GOING TO DROP THEM
trainval/qzR62JJCMBQ/50013 LET'S SAY THIS IS AN ANXIOUS THOUGHT
trainval/qzR62JJCMBQ/50014 EVERYTHING'S GOING FINE AND WE SEE THE ANXIOUS THOUGHT
trainval/qzR62JJCMBQ/50015 YOU GO BACK TO IT REPEAT IT
trainval/qzR62JJCMBQ/50018 WOW THERE'S SO MUCH ANXIETY
trainval/qzR62JJCMBQ/50019 AND WE REINFORCE THE STORYLINE RIGHT
trainval/qzR62JJCMBQ/50020 AND IT'S ONLY IN LEARNING TO WATCH THE MIND IN THIS WAY THAT WE CAN START TO LET GO OF THOSE STORYLINES AND
trainval/qzR62JJCMBQ/50021 YOU MIGHT FIND A MIND THAT'S VERY DULL AND BORING AND IT'S JUST ALMOST MECHANICAL IT JUST SEEMS IT'S
trainval/qzR62JJCMBQ/50022 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BURN ANY INCENSE AND YOU DEFINITELY DON'T HAVE TO SIT ON THE FLOOR
trainval/qzwCujeSSSc/50001 EVENTUALLY I'M LIKE OH MY GOD OK
trainval/qzwCujeSSSc/50002 MY BRAIN WAS LIKE WHAT ARE YOU DOING MAN
trainval/qzwCujeSSSc/50003 THIS WASN'T IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME
trainval/qzwCujeSSSc/50004 AND THE ALGORITHM WAS
trainval/qzwCujeSSSc/50006 AND INDEED LOVE IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS BECAUSE ALMOST EVERY ONE OF US PURSUE LOVE EVEN THOUGH WE
trainval/qzwCujeSSSc/50007 THAT IS WHAT IT TAKES TO CHANGE THE WORLD
trainval/r1qdSnDm67s/50001 BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE A TON OF WORK
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50001 NUMBER SIX DON'T EQUATE YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH THEIRS
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50002 AND WE MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE TO LIVE WHO TO MARRY AND EVEN WHO OUR FRIENDS ARE GOING TO BE BASED ON WHAT WE
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50003 A CONVERSATION REQUIRES A BALANCE BETWEEN TALKING AND LISTENING AND SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY WE LOST THAT BALANCE
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50004 AND MANY OF THEM ALMOST MOST OF THEM ARE MORE LIKELY TO TEXT THEIR FRIENDS THAN THEY ARE TO TALK TO THEM FACE TO
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50005 IT WAS WRITTEN BY A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER NAMED PAUL BARNWELL
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50006 AND HE GAVE HIS KIDS A COMMUNICATION PROJECT
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50007 AND HE SAID THIS I CAME TO REALIZE
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50008 I TALK TO PEOPLE THAT I LIKE
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50009 I TALK TO PEOPLE THAT I DON'T LIKE
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50010 I TALK TO SOME PEOPLE THAT I DISAGREE WITH DEEPLY ON A PERSONAL LEVEL
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50011 SO I WANT YOU TO FORGET ALL OF THAT
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50012 LEARN TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITHOUT WASTING YOUR TIME WITHOUT GETTING BORED AND PLEASE GOD WITHOUT
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50013 WE'VE HAD THEM BEFORE
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50014 WE KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50015 THE KIND OF CONVERSATION WHERE YOU WALK AWAY FEELING ENGAGED AND INSPIRED OR WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'VE MADE A REAL
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50016 THERE IS NO REASON WHY MOST OF YOUR INTERACTIONS CAN'T BE LIKE THAT
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50017 SO I HAVE 10 BASIC RULES
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50018 NUMBER ONE DON'T MULTITASK
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50019 AND I DON'T MEAN JUST SET DOWN YOUR CELL PHONE OR YOUR TABLET OR YOUR CAR KEYS OR WHATEVER IS IN YOUR HAND
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50020 I MEAN BE PRESENT
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50021 DON'T THINK ABOUT YOUR ARGUMENT YOU HAD WITH YOUR BOSS
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50022 DON'T THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE FOR DINNER
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50023 IF YOU WANT TO STATE YOUR OPINION WITHOUT ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR RESPONSE OR ARGUMENT
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50024 THE FAMED THERAPIST M
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50025 SCOTT PECK SAID THAT TRUE LISTENING REQUIRES A SETTING ASIDE OF ONESELF
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50026 ARE NOT SAFE EITHER
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50027 YES I WAS VERY ANGRY
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50028 THEY'RE THE ONES THAT KNOW
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50029 TRY ASKING THEM THINGS LIKE WHAT WAS THAT LIKE
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50030 BECAUSE THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE TO STOP FOR A MOMENT AND THINK ABOUT IT AND YOU'RE GOING TO GET A MUCH MORE
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50031 THAT MEANS THOUGHTS WILL COME INTO YOUR MIND AND YOU NEED TO LET THEM GO OUT OF YOUR MIND
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50032 WE'VE HEARD INTERVIEWS OFTEN IN WHICH A GUEST IS TALKING FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AND THEN THE HOST COMES BACK IN AND
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50033 AND WE DO THE EXACT SAME THING
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50034 NOW PEOPLE ON THE RADIO ESPECIALLY ON NPR ARE MUCH MORE AWARE THAT THEY'RE GOING ON THE RECORD AND SO THEY'RE MORE
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50035 ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50036 IF THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THE TROUBLE THEY'RE HAVING AT WORK DON'T TELL THEM ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU HATE YOUR JOB
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50037 THEY DON'T CARE
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50038 WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT IS YOU
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50039 IT'S NOT THE SAME
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50040 LEAVE THEM OUT
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50041 IT IS NEVER THE SAME
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50042 I'M THE CENTER OF ATTENTION
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50043 SO OUR MINDS ARE FILLING IN THOSE OTHER 275 WORDS
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50044 ALL EXPERIENCES ARE INDIVIDUAL
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50045 STEPHEN COVEY SAID IT VERY BEAUTIFULLY
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50046 SHE WON A PULITZER PRIZE
trainval/R1vskiVDwl4/50047 SOMEBODY ASKED STEPHEN HAWKING ONCE WHAT HIS IQ WAS AND HE SAID I HAVE NO IDEA
trainval/R21MsHQA8vM/50001 AND IT OCCURRED TO ME I MIGHT WRITE A NOVEL
trainval/R21MsHQA8vM/50002 SOME OF THEM WERE BOOKS ABOUT DREAMS
trainval/R21MsHQA8vM/50004 I LL WORK WITH MY DREAMS
trainval/R21MsHQA8vM/50005 I D NEVER HEARD ABOUT THAT
trainval/R21MsHQA8vM/50006 AND SO EACH DREAM IS ONLY ONE CHAPTER AND CARRIES THE STORY FORWARD A LITTLE BIT
trainval/R21MsHQA8vM/50007 THIS WILL WORK FOR ME
trainval/R21MsHQA8vM/50008 I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT THE SAME DREAM KEPT COMING BACK
trainval/R21MsHQA8vM/50009 WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS LANGUAGE
trainval/R21MsHQA8vM/50011 WITHIN A WEEK I WAS ON AN AIRPLANE DOWN TO MIAMI
trainval/R21MsHQA8vM/50012 I WENT TO MY FATHER S PLACE
trainval/R21MsHQA8vM/50013 IT WAS WONDERFUL FOR ME
trainval/R21MsHQA8vM/50014 TWO WEEKS LATER I GOT A PHONE CALL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT MY FATHER HAD A HEART ATTACK
trainval/R21MsHQA8vM/50015 IT WENT IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION
trainval/R21MsHQA8vM/50016 WE D WORK WITH DREAMS
trainval/R21MsHQA8vM/50017 AND THEN IT WENT IN A DIRECTION THAT I DIDN T LIKE
trainval/R21MsHQA8vM/50018 I SAID NO WAY
trainval/R21MsHQA8vM/50019 YOU DON T HAVE TO BE AN EXPERT TO DO THIS
trainval/R21MsHQA8vM/50020 ANYONE CAN DO THIS
trainval/R21MsHQA8vM/50021 NOW THE STANDARD IDEA OF DREAMS IS THAT WE HAVE THIS
trainval/R21MsHQA8vM/50022 IT S NOT JUST THE WHOLE STAGE
trainval/R21MsHQA8vM/50023 MAYBE THE WHOLE CAMPUS
trainval/R21MsHQA8vM/50024 MONTAGUE ULLMAN WENT FURTHER THAN THAT
trainval/R21MsHQA8vM/50025 YOU ALWAYS SEE THE BUDDHA SITTING ON A LOTUS FLOWER
trainval/R21MsHQA8vM/50026 AND IT CAME OUT OF ME
trainval/R21MsHQA8vM/50027 AND ACTUALLY THEY COULD MAKE PEOPLE MOVE THEIR ARM AGAIN
trainval/R21MsHQA8vM/50028 THE PROBLEMS IRON OUT
trainval/R2kOgSVF2Uk/50001 THIS IS CALLED COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER AND IT'S BIZARRE
trainval/R2kOgSVF2Uk/50002 WE HAVE HUGE GRAND CHALLENGES THESE DAYS OF HABITAT LOSS
trainval/R2kOgSVF2Uk/50003 I UNDERSTAND THAT
trainval/R2kOgSVF2Uk/50004 AGAIN A BIT COUNTERINTUITIVE
trainval/R2kOgSVF2Uk/50005 WHY ARE BEES DOING BETTER IN THE CITY
trainval/R2kOgSVF2Uk/50006 THIS IS A BIG QUESTION NOW TO HELP US UNDERSTAND WHY THEY SHOULD BE IN THE CITY
trainval/R2kOgSVF2Uk/50007 AND COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER IS NOT THE ONLY THING AFFECTING HONEYBEES
trainval/R2kOgSVF2Uk/50008 THE BEES JUST AREN'T AROUND ANYMORE
trainval/R2kOgSVF2Uk/50009 WHAT CAN WE DO HERE
trainval/R2kOgSVF2Uk/50010 I GOT MY PH
trainval/R2kOgSVF2Uk/50011 WE EXERCISE WE EAT HEALTHY WE TAKE VITAMINS
trainval/R2kOgSVF2Uk/50012 WHY DON'T WE THINK ABOUT HONEYBEES IN THAT SAME TYPE OF WAY
trainval/R2kOgSVF2Uk/50013 WE HAVE ALSO SOME IMAGES OF HONEY FROM BROOKLYN
trainval/R2kOgSVF2Uk/50014 PARIS HAS BEEN A TERRIFIC MODEL FOR URBAN BEEKEEPING
trainval/R2kOgSVF2Uk/50015 A BEE ISN'T GOING TO STING YOU IF YOU SEE IT
trainval/r2SX7mTUirk/50001 AND I USED TO TRY TO TALK ABOUT THAT AS A SCIENTIST AND I WOULD GET PUSH BACK FROM MY GRADUATE SCHOOL
trainval/r2SX7mTUirk/50002 THIS GENERATION IS THE FIRST GENERATION WITH A USER'S GUIDE TO THE HUMAN BRAIN
trainval/r2SX7mTUirk/50003 AND THE QUESTION IS HOW WILL WE USE IT
trainval/r2SX7mTUirk/50004 WHAT WILL WE DO WITH IT
trainval/r2SX7mTUirk/50005 WHY NOT APPLY NEUROSCIENCE TO FIXING NATURE
trainval/r2SX7mTUirk/50006 HOW CAN I HELP BRING THEM BACK
trainval/r2SX7mTUirk/50007 I'VE BEEN PART OF DRIVING THEM TO EXTINCTION HOW CAN I HELP TO BRING THEM BACK
trainval/r2SX7mTUirk/50008 I WISH YOU WATER
trainval/r2YiRiLAUSY/50001 EMPIRES ROSE AND FELL
trainval/r2YiRiLAUSY/50002 SOME DID BETTER THAN OTHERS
trainval/r2YiRiLAUSY/50003 HOW SMART DO YOU WANT TO BE
trainval/r3afSFSG570/50001 I EVEN MANAGED TO PERSUADE A PROFESSOR IN OXFORD TO LET ME WORK IN HIS LABORATORY FOR A FEW MONTHS
trainval/r3afSFSG570/50002 AND TO DIAGNOSE THESE DISEASES A DOCTOR WOULD FREQUENTLY HAVE TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE CELLS WITH
trainval/r3afSFSG570/50003 AND I SAW NO SIGNAL IF A MOTHER IS CARRYING A BABY GIRL
trainval/r3afSFSG570/50004 AND ONE EXAMPLE OF A GENETIC DISEASE WHICH IS SEX LINKED IS HEMOPHILIA WHICH IS A GENETIC DISORDER
trainval/r3afSFSG570/50005 AND EVERY TIME WE DO THIS THERE IS A CHANCE THAT THE BABY MIGHT MISCARRY
trainval/r3afSFSG570/50006 AND THEN I SPENT THE NEXT TWO HOURS THINKING ABOUT THAT IDEA
trainval/r3afSFSG570/50007 NOW IF REGARDED THE RELEASE OF DNA FROM A BABY INTO HIS MOTHER'S BLOOD
trainval/r3afSFSG570/50008 I HAVE ACTUALLY LOST ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS FROM SCHOOL TO THIS DISEASE
trainval/r3afSFSG570/50009 I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE
trainval/r3afSFSG570/50010 NOW RECENTLY A PREGNANT WOMAN SENT HER BLOOD SAMPLE TO OUR LABORATORY FOR PRE NATAL TESTING
trainval/r3afSFSG570/50011 SHE WANTED TO KNOW WHETHER HER BABY IS HEALTHY OR NOT
trainval/r3afSFSG570/50012 WE CALL THIS PLASMA DNA TISSUE MAPPING
trainval/r3afSFSG570/50013 IT'S IN A WAY LIKE A TYPE OF MRI SCAN WHICH WILL ALSO GIVE YOU GENOMIC INFORMATION
trainval/r3afSFSG570/50014 SO BY USING THIS PLASMA DNA TISSUE MAPPING IT WILL BASICALLY ALLOW US TO MONITOR CELL DEATH FROM DIFFERENT PARTS
trainval/r3L9n20myqk/50001 3 TONNES SAVES THEMSELVES ABOUT 600
trainval/r3L9n20myqk/50002 WHAT THEY SAY IS
trainval/r3L9n20myqk/50003 WHO'S UP FOR THAT
trainval/r4KQfepEqWQ/50001 WHAT WAS THE KEY
trainval/r4KQfepEqWQ/50002 TO OVERCOME THIS CUED SPEECH WAS DEVELOPED BY DR
trainval/r4KQfepEqWQ/50003 IT'S A VERY SIMPLE SYSTEM
trainval/r4KQfepEqWQ/50004 LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
trainval/r4KQfepEqWQ/50005 THEY LOOK ALIKE
trainval/r4KQfepEqWQ/50006 WHAT ABOUT AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE
trainval/r4KQfepEqWQ/50007 AND IT DOESN'T WORK ALL OF THE TIME
trainval/r4KQfepEqWQ/50008 AND THAT'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT OUTCOME IF YOU KNOW THE HISTORY OF LITERACY ISSUES FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE DEAF
trainval/r4KQfepEqWQ/50009 THE FIRST TIME I SAW CUED SPEECH IN ACTION I ASKED THE MOTHER I JUST MET WHY SHE HAD CHOSEN TO CUE
trainval/r4KQfepEqWQ/50010 OR YOU CAN TELL SOMEONE ABOUT IT
trainval/r4KQfepEqWQ/50011 YOU CAN GET THE WORD OUT
trainval/r55a0FapF2M/50001 THAT'S NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
trainval/r55a0FapF2M/50002 ITS NAME WAS MESOTHELIN
trainval/r55a0FapF2M/50003 AND IT HAS THESE AMAZING PROPERTIES
trainval/r55a0FapF2M/50004 THEY ARE SUPER SUPER COOL
trainval/r55a0FapF2M/50006 THEN IT HIT ME
trainval/r55a0FapF2M/50007 I GOT THE LAB SPACE I NEEDED
trainval/r55a0FapF2M/50008 AT THE END I ENDED UP WITH THE PAPER SENSOR THAT COULD DETECT A 100 OF ALL PANCREATIC OVARIAN AND LUNG
trainval/r6nSmSTKHGc/50001 WE INDUCE CELLS OKAY SAY SKIN CELLS BY ADDING A FEW GENES TO THEM CULTURING THEM AND THEN
trainval/r6nSmSTKHGc/50002 SO WITHOUT THE CONTROVERSY THAT'S COOL THING NUMBER ONE
trainval/R7beBKnH9u0/50001 HOW DO YOU WANT TO SPEND YOUR TIME
trainval/R7beBKnH9u0/50002 WHO I REALLY AM
trainval/R84vqXjXWJc/50001 SOUND LIKE ONE MORNING I COULD WAKE UP AND SEE MY SON AS A REPEAT OF LAST WEEK'S STORY
trainval/R8Uz4snIkJ4/50001 SO I DID A STREET CASTING AND I APPROACHED A FEW HOMELESS PEOPLE
trainval/R8Uz4snIkJ4/50002 HE SAID YEAH
trainval/R8Uz4snIkJ4/50003 I KNEW THAT SAN FRANCISCO WAS THE TECH CAPITAL OF THE WORLD HOSTING MANY OF THE
trainval/R8Uz4snIkJ4/50004 YOU MUST BE WONDERING ALL RIGHT SO WHAT ARE YOU UP TO NOW
trainval/r8WPIZJOJuk/50001 SPECIES THAT DO NOT EVOLVE DIE
trainval/r8WPIZJOJuk/50002 WE FEEL QUITE COMFORTABLE SAFE AND HAPPY
trainval/r8WPIZJOJuk/50003 IS IT REALLY THAT SERIOUS
trainval/r8WPIZJOJuk/50004 BUT NOT EVERYWHERE
trainval/r92jUj7gNRw/50001 THEY WERE IN THE NEXT ROOM I COULD HEAR THEM CHATTING
trainval/r92jUj7gNRw/50002 IN THE END WE SUCCEEDED
trainval/r92jUj7gNRw/50003 I LOVE WHAT I DO BUT I LOVE MY KIDS MORE
trainval/r92jUj7gNRw/50004 I REMEMBER WHEN MY SON WAS SIX HE HAD A FRIEND OVER TO PLAY
trainval/r92jUj7gNRw/50005 PEOPLE WROTE AND SAID PLEASE CAN I HELP
trainval/r92jUj7gNRw/50007 ALL WE HAD WAS A WONDERFUL TIGHT GROUP OF FABULOUS
trainval/r92jUj7gNRw/50008 AND I HAVE WAITED LONG ENOUGH
trainval/r92jUj7gNRw/50009 I'VE WAITED LONG ENOUGH IN MY OWN BUSINESS
trainval/r92jUj7gNRw/50010 2016 THE UN WERE LOOKING FOR A BRAND NEW AMBASSADOR TO REPRESENT WOMEN'S
trainval/r92jUj7gNRw/50011 BECAUSE HERE'S THE CRITICAL THING THE ONE PLACE WOMEN AND MEN ARE ABSOLUTELY EQUAL IS AT THE BALLOT
trainval/r92jUj7gNRw/50012 AND WHEN THE MEN IN THE RACE SAW HOW MANY VOTES WE WERE ATTRACTING WONDER OF
trainval/r92jUj7gNRw/50013 ALL I GOT WERE EMPTY PROMISES AND DISAPPOINTMENT ENOUGH DISAPPOINTMENT TO FOUND A
trainval/r92jUj7gNRw/50014 WHAT WE NEED IS A SEISMIC CHANGE IN THE GLOBAL POLITICAL LANDSCAPE
trainval/r92jUj7gNRw/50015 IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT WE DID WE'RE GIVING IT AWAY
trainval/r92jUj7gNRw/50016 CAN YOU IMAGINE IF WE COULD MOBILIZE MILLIONS OF WOMEN ACROSS THE WORLD TO
trainval/r92jUj7gNRw/50017 TO THE TRADITIONAL BATTLES OF POLITICS
trainval/r92jUj7gNRw/50018 TO SAY STOP THE BICKERING LET'S GET THE WORK DONE
trainval/r92jUj7gNRw/50019 BECAUSE THE FACT IS EQUALITY IS BETTER FOR EVERYONE
trainval/r92jUj7gNRw/50020 COME ON PEOPLE LET'S ACTIVATE
trainval/r92jUj7gNRw/50021 WE WANTED PEOPLE FROM THE LEFT FROM THE RIGHT FROM THE MIDDLE EVERY AGE GROUP
trainval/r92jUj7gNRw/50022 BECAUSE THE WHOLE POINT WAS TO WORK WITH A SIMPLE AGENDA LET'S GET EQUALITY IN EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIVES
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50001 UPON FIRST ARRIVING THERE THE FIRST GOAL THAT I HAD WAS FOR ME TO IDENTIFY
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50002 I WAS JUST COMING DOWN TO MAKE MY SELECTION
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50003 NOR DID I GET ANY RESPONSES FROM THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT THEY GAVE ME ON THE LIST WHERE I COULD GET APARTMENTS
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50004 SO AS A RESULT OF THAT AND FEELING REJECTED I WENT BACK TO THE BASE AND I TALKED TO THE SQUADRON
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50005 HIS NAME WAS MCDOW MAJOR MCDOW
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50006 I SAID MAJOR MCDOW I NEED YOUR HELP
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50007 BUT YOU KNOW THE PROBLEM
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50008 AND BESIDES WE HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY AND WE REALLY DON'T WANT TO DAMAGE THAT
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50009 BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I FIGURED THAT WAS THE BEST THING THAT I COULD DO
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50010 HE SAID BEFORE I SAY YES TO THAT I NEED TO CHECK WITH MANAGEMENT
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50011 SO WHAT I DID AND HE SAID YOU SHOULDN'T WORRY JIM BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF TRAILER PARKS SO I PUT
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50012 I WENT TO ONE AFTER ANOTHER AFTER ANOTHER
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50013 I MEAN A REALLY SMALL TRAILER PARK
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50014 SO I CALLED MY WIFE AND I SAID WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS THING WORK
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50015 AND WE MOVED INTO IT AND WE BECAME HOMEOWNERS IN MOUNTAIN HOME IDAHO
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50016 SOMEWHERE AROUND 6
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50017 30 7 O'CLOCK WE GOT A LITTLE BIT TIRED AND WE SAID WHY DON'T WE GET A MOTEL SO THAT WE CAN REST AND THEN HAVE AN EARLY
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50018 I SAID I WOULD LIKE TO GET A MOTEL FOR THE EVENING FOR MY FAMILY
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50019 AND SO WE HAD A GREAT SLEEP THAT NIGHT
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50020 WHAT CAN WE DO
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50021 WE DO EVERYTHING THAT YOU TOLD US TO DO
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50022 WHEN STOPPED BY THE POLICE WE PLACE BOTH HANDS ON THE STEERING WHEEL AT THE 12 O'CLOCK POSITION
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50023 AFTER IT'S OVER CALL US AND WE'LL BE THE ONES TO CHALLENGE
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50024 YOU NEED TO PUSH BACK YOU NEED TO CHALLENGE
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50025 THE PIECE THAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THAT IS THAT WE HAD SIMILAR KINDS OF EXPERIENCES FROM IDAHO
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50026 AND HERE'S WHAT THE BOYS HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TO TELL THEM WE KNOW THAT YOU CAN DO THAT BUT PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50027 AND SO AS A GRANDPARENT WHAT DO I TELL MY GRANDSONS
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50028 HOW DO I KEEP THEM SAFE HOW DO I KEEP THEM ALIVE
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50029 WE WERE REJECTED FROM HOTELS MOTELS AND RESTAURANTS
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50030 THE SECOND THING I DO IS THIS
trainval/r9DDE7NV1Nw/50031 WE HAVE TO CHALLENGE THAT IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE
trainval/R9g3QSqvtss/50001 SO HE HAD TO RESIGN
trainval/R9g3QSqvtss/50002 ISN'T THAT NICE
trainval/R9g3QSqvtss/50003 IT DOESN'T WORK
trainval/R9g3QSqvtss/50004 AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES THEM INTO PARTNERS
trainval/R9g3QSqvtss/50005 THAT'S THE FIRST ONE
trainval/R9g3QSqvtss/50006 WHAT ABOUT THE EYES
trainval/R9g3QSqvtss/50008 WHAT DO YOU THINK KARAJAN'S REPLY WAS
trainval/R9g3QSqvtss/50009 SO YOU ARE UNDER TREMENDOUS PRESSURE BECAUSE I DON'T GIVE YOU INSTRUCTION AND YET YOU HAVE TO GUESS MY MIND
trainval/R9g3QSqvtss/50010 IT'S NOT THAT
trainval/R9g3QSqvtss/50011 YOU HAVE THIS CONTROL
trainval/R9g3QSqvtss/50012 YOU KNOW WHY
trainval/r9LelXa3USI/50001 THEY GET NO GREAT PLEASURE FROM WHAT THEY DO
trainval/r9LelXa3USI/50002 THERE ARE GREAT ONES LIKE KIPP'S IT'S A GREAT SYSTEM
trainval/r9LelXa3USI/50003 THERE ARE MANY GREAT MODELS
trainval/r9Zz4hYuGdw/50001 IN FACT SIX OF THE 10 COUNTRIES WHERE 95 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION SAID
trainval/r9Zz4hYuGdw/50002 IN SOME CASES RELIGION DRIVES MANY AFRICANS TO EXTRAORDINARY LENGTH TO ATTACK OTHER HUMAN
trainval/r9Zz4hYuGdw/50004 WE HAVE TO MUSTER THE WILL AND COURAGE TO DO WHAT PEOPLE HAVE NEVER DONE
trainval/r9Zz4hYuGdw/50005 ENVISAGE WHAT PEOPLE HAVE NEVER IMAGINED
trainval/r9Zz4hYuGdw/50006 GO TO PLACES HUMAN BEINGS HAVE NOT BEEN TO
trainval/r9Zz4hYuGdw/50008 WE NEED TO PUT AN END TO THIS GAME OF BLAME THAT HAS PREVENTED US FROM TAKING FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR OWN
trainval/rAA8mMQi0is/50003 WE SEE WHERE IT'S BOUNCING BUT WE DON'T SEE THEM AS THEY EXIST
trainval/rAA8mMQi0is/50004 WHEN IT'S BOUNCED ON THE MOON WE SEE IT
trainval/rAA8mMQi0is/50005 THE SAME THING IN THE DARKROOM
trainval/rAAY1jOZFSE/50001 WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT
trainval/rAAY1jOZFSE/50002 ARE YOU WILL TO LOVE AND ACCEPT
trainval/raCIUeGUr3s/50001 OUR BANKING INDUSTRY OUR OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY OUR COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY WERE ALL AT THE BOTTOM OF THE
trainval/raCIUeGUr3s/50002 AND THE ECONOMY INDEED SEEMED TO START SHOWING SOME SIGNS OF LIFE
trainval/raCIUeGUr3s/50003 THE NEXT MAYOR CAME ALONG
trainval/raCIUeGUr3s/50004 WE WEREN'T ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THE TOP BUT WE WERE ON THE LIST WE WERE SOMEBODY
trainval/raCIUeGUr3s/50005 YOU KNOW THESE ARE CITIES THAT TYPICALLY YOU'RE NOT EMBARRASSED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH
trainval/raCIUeGUr3s/50006 I LOST ABOUT A POUND A WEEK FOR ABOUT 40 WEEKS
trainval/raCIUeGUr3s/50007 AND SO THEY STARTED HELPING US DRIVE TRAFFIC TO THE WEBSITE
trainval/raCIUeGUr3s/50008 AND THE LARGE COMPANIES THEY TYPICALLY HAVE WONDERFUL WELLNESS PROGRAMS BUT THE MEDIUM SIZED COMPANIES THAT TYPICALLY
trainval/raCIUeGUr3s/50009 WE HOSTED THE OLYMPIC TRIALS LAST SPRING
trainval/raCIUeGUr3s/50010 WE'RE EVEN GOING BACK INTO SOME INNER CITY SITUATIONS WHERE WE HAD BUILT NEIGHBORHOODS AND WE HAD BUILT
trainval/raCIUeGUr3s/50011 OUR STREETS WERE REALLY WIDE AND YOU'D PUSH THE BUTTON TO ALLOW YOU TO WALK ACROSS AND YOU HAD TO RUN
trainval/raCIUeGUr3s/50012 WE HAVE THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE UNITED STATES PROBABLY THE STRONGEST ECONOMY IN THE UNITED STATES
trainval/ramueKMLXZY/50001 ALL OF MY INTERACTIONS TOOK PLACE WITH EITHER A STEEL DOOR OR A THICK VISITATION ROOM WINDOW BETWEEN
trainval/ramueKMLXZY/50002 I'VE OVERHEARD OFFICERS IN MAXIMUM CUSTODY DESCRIBE THEIR ROLES AS ROOM SERVICE
trainval/ramueKMLXZY/50003 OFFICERS THE STAFF THAT HAVE ALWAYS SPENT THE MOST TIME WITH INMATES ARE
trainval/ramueKMLXZY/50004 WHEN I ASKED HIM ABOUT THAT MOMENT HE SAID HE WAS TRYING TO REMEMBER THE LAST TIME THAT SOMEBODY HAD EXTENDED THEIR HAND TO HIM IN
trainval/ramueKMLXZY/50005 HE SAID THAT THEIR SUPPORT ENCOURAGES HIM TO MAKE BETTER CHOICES AND TO THINK ABOUT HIS FUTURE
trainval/ramueKMLXZY/50006 A LIFE OUTSIDE OF MAXIMUM CUSTODY
trainval/ramueKMLXZY/50007 INMATES WHO HAD ONCE REPEATEDLY VIOLATED THE RULES SLOWLY START TO DEMONSTRATE THE SKILLS TAUGHT THROUGH
trainval/rAZPIxYvBAE/50001 AND WE WERE VERY EXCITED
trainval/rAZPIxYvBAE/50002 AND DON'T JUST BUY THEM FOR YOUR DAUGHTERS BUY THEM FOR YOUR SONS
trainval/rAZPIxYvBAE/50003 BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT BOYS PLAY WITH AND AS FEMALE SUPERHEROES JUST AS MY DAUGHTER
trainval/rB6WmWvvyxg/50001 I THOUGHT THIS WAS A MINOR UPSET IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND I THOUGHT THINGS WOULD GET BETTER INTO MIDDLE SCHOOL
trainval/rB6WmWvvyxg/50002 PRETTY SOON MY PARENTS GOT ANNOYED WITH DRIVING BACK AND FORTH AND I HAD TO GO BACK TO MY OLD CATHOLIC SCHOOL
trainval/rB6WmWvvyxg/50003 I THOUGHT FOR SURE I WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND AT LEAST ONE SOCIAL GROUP OUT OF 2000 KIDS
trainval/rB6WmWvvyxg/50004 THERE HAS TO BE SOMEWHERE WHERE I CAN FIT IN AND BELONG EVEN IF THE STIGMA FOLLOWED ME
trainval/rB6WmWvvyxg/50005 I JUST RAN AND RAN AND RAN
trainval/RBElFl1aLtI/50001 15 IN THE MORNING
trainval/RBElFl1aLtI/50002 SHE LEFT THE NIGHTCLUB EARLY AND SHE'S WALKING BY HERSELF WHEN OUT OF THE SHADOWS EMERGES A LARGE MALE FIGURE
trainval/RBElFl1aLtI/50003 SHE SAYS NO
trainval/RBElFl1aLtI/50004 SHE HAS A DEADLINE TO MEET
trainval/RBElFl1aLtI/50005 SHE NEEDS TO FINISH HER PAPER BEFORE MIDNIGHT
trainval/RBElFl1aLtI/50006 AND MOST IMPORTANTLY RAPE IS NOT ONLY BETWEEN STRANGERS
trainval/RBElFl1aLtI/50007 HOW MANY PEOPLE IN HERE THINK THAT THEY HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT SEXUAL ASSAULT IS
trainval/RBElFl1aLtI/50008 RAISE YOUR HANDS
trainval/RBElFl1aLtI/50009 A WOMAN IS WALKING DOWN A DARK DESERTED ALLEYWAY AT 2
trainval/RBElFl1aLtI/50010 IT'S TIME TO LET GO OF THAT PART OF US THAT LIKES TO SUFFER THAT LIKES TO BE A MARTYR IN A CRUEL AND
trainval/RBElFl1aLtI/50011 WE CAN SAY THAT NO LONGER DOES OUR PAST DICTATE WHO WE ARE AS PEOPLE TODAY
trainval/RBfdvib2irc/50001 THE BEST WAS TO BECOME ONE OF THOSE 2
trainval/RBfdvib2irc/50002 6 BILLION PEOPLE MYSELF
trainval/RBfdvib2irc/50003 IT WAS A QUITE LONESOME TIME BECAUSE PEOPLE STOPPED VISITING ME MY GIRLFRIEND EVEN REFUSED TO COME FROM RIGA TO
trainval/RBfdvib2irc/50004 THE WOMEN WHO WERE ABLE TO WORK WITH LEATHER WORKED WITH LEATHER THE ONES WHO WERE WORKING WITH WOOL WERE WORKING WITH WOOL
trainval/RBfdvib2irc/50005 WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THIS I WENT WITH THE INTERNS OF MY COMPANY TO THIS VILLAGE AND WE REALIZED THAT MANY
trainval/RBfdvib2irc/50006 THEY SAID YES BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW
trainval/RBfdvib2irc/50008 ONE BILLION PEOPLE LACK ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER
trainval/rbnBeSvXGQM/50001 HE COULD REST
trainval/rbnBeSvXGQM/50002 IT COULD BE A SUIT
trainval/rbnBeSvXGQM/50003 IT COULD BE A GOWN
trainval/rbnBeSvXGQM/50004 IT COULD BE A DRESS
trainval/rbnBeSvXGQM/50005 BUT IT'S ALWAYS LIGHT BLUE
trainval/rbnBeSvXGQM/50006 AND A COUPLE OF TIMES SHE SORT OF GREETS
trainval/rbnBeSvXGQM/50007 ALWAYS WITH A SMILE
trainval/rbnBeSvXGQM/50008 I REMEMBER THEM
trainval/rbnBeSvXGQM/50009 AND I AM OLD
trainval/rbnBeSvXGQM/50010 AND I'M TRYING TO TELL THEM GUYS
trainval/rbnBeSvXGQM/50011 I'VE DONE THIS
trainval/rbnBeSvXGQM/50012 I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT AGAIN
trainval/RbNqU2K0qzo/50001 THE WORLD IS FACING SO MANY DIFFERENT CONSERVATION CRISES
trainval/RbNqU2K0qzo/50002 TAPIRS DO NOT EAT ANTS
trainval/RbNqU2K0qzo/50003 AND I TOLD YOU ROADKILL IS A BIG PROBLEM FOR TAPIRS IN THE CERRADO SO WE JUST CAME UP WITH THE IDEA
trainval/rBt7LMrIkxg/50001 AND THE GOAL THEN IS TO USE THAT EXPERT BRAIN MAP AS A
trainval/rcdwNSDSTl4/50001 WHAT IF WE PUT EMPLOYEES INTO THOSE MARKETS NOT TO SELL ANYTHING RIGHT AWAY PER
trainval/rcdwNSDSTl4/50002 THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALL DAY HERE TODAY
trainval/rcdwNSDSTl4/50003 WE'VE GOTTEN SOME REALLY GREAT IDEAS ON HOW WE MIGHT DO THAT
trainval/rcdwNSDSTl4/50004 REMEMBER WHAT CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN POINTED OUT IN HIS BRILLIANT BOOK THE INNOVATOR'S DILEMMA WHEN YOU START
trainval/rcdwNSDSTl4/50005 LEADERSHIP IS EXHAUSTING
trainval/RcGyVTAoXEU/50001 AND HERE THE SCIENCE SAYS YES
trainval/RcGyVTAoXEU/50002 STOP STOP STOP
trainval/RcGyVTAoXEU/50003 BEFORE THEY WENT THROUGH THE SOCIAL STRESS TEST THEY WERE TAUGHT TO RETHINK THEIR STRESS RESPONSE AS HELPFUL
trainval/RcGyVTAoXEU/50004 SO MY GOAL AS A HEALTH PSYCHOLOGIST HAS CHANGED
trainval/RcGyVTAoXEU/50005 I NO LONGER WANT TO GET RID OF YOUR STRESS
trainval/RcGyVTAoXEU/50006 YOUR PITUITARY GLAND PUMPS THIS STUFF OUT AS PART OF THE STRESS RESPONSE
trainval/RcGyVTAoXEU/50007 IT ALSO HELPS YOUR BLOOD VESSELS STAY RELAXED DURING STRESS
trainval/rCplocVemjo/50001 I WAS I SUPPOSE THE FIRST USER
trainval/rCplocVemjo/50002 WHAT WOULD BE ON YOUR LIST FOR THAT MAGNA CARTA
trainval/Re53vgaVFvI/50001 I AM ON THIS STAGE BECAUSE I AM A PRETTY WHITE WOMEN
trainval/Re53vgaVFvI/50002 IN MY INDUSTRY WE CALL THAT A SEXY GIRL
trainval/Re53vgaVFvI/50003 YOU KNOW YOU CAN BE ANYTHING
trainval/Re53vgaVFvI/50004 AND YEAH THEY PRETTY MUCH RETOUCH ALL THE PHOTOS BUT THAT IS ONLY A SMALL COMPONENT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING
trainval/Re53vgaVFvI/50005 WHEN WILL I GET STOPPED
trainval/Re53vgaVFvI/50006 BUT MOSTLY IT WAS DIFFICULT TO UNPACK A LEGACY OF GENDER AND RACIAL OPRESSION WHEN I'M
trainval/Re53vgaVFvI/50007 IF THERE IS A TAKE AWAY TO THIS TALK I HOPE IS THAT WE ALL FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE ACKNOWLEDGING THE
trainval/ReCvreRPdeY/50001 THAT CAN BE FOR LOTS OF REASONS
trainval/ReCvreRPdeY/50002 THOSE BABIES ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND THEY ARE VULNERABLE FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE
trainval/ReCvreRPdeY/50003 WHY ARE THEY VULNERABLE
trainval/ReCvreRPdeY/50004 NOW WHAT ABOUT THE BABIES AT THE HIGH END
trainval/ReCvreRPdeY/50005 THE BABIES AT THE HIGH END ARE VULNERABLE BECAUSE THEY GOT TOO MUCH NUTRITION AND THAT'S ALMOST
trainval/ReCvreRPdeY/50007 I HOPE YOU'LL ENJOY IT SO YOU WILL FEEL LIKE WE'RE ALL PART OF THE SAME TEAM THAT'S GOING TO MAKE OUR WORLD
trainval/ReCvreRPdeY/50008 IS THEY CAUSE AN INFLAMMATORY REACTION THAT'S VERY LOW GRADE AND THEY MAKE THOSE PEOPLE
trainval/ReCvreRPdeY/50009 SO HERE'S THE WORD
trainval/ReCvreRPdeY/50010 AND THAT DOESN'T CHANGE
trainval/ReCvreRPdeY/50011 HOWEVER WHAT YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW IS EPIGENETICS AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT BEFORE YOU'RE BORN
trainval/ReCvreRPdeY/50012 AND WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS
trainval/rEgSZNB3qyI/50001 I REALLY DON'T KNOW
trainval/rEgSZNB3qyI/50002 SO WHAT I DID WAS AGAIN LIKE I DID WITH THE DODO SKULL I BLEW ALL MY REFERENCE UP TO FULL SIZE AND THEN I BEGAN
trainval/rEgSZNB3qyI/50003 BUT AGAIN I AM NOT A SCULPTOR AND SO I DON'T KNOW A LOT OF THE TRICKS LIKE I DON'T KNOW HOW MY FRIEND MIKE GETS
trainval/rEgSZNB3qyI/50004 BUT THERE WAS A PROBLEM
trainval/rEgSZNB3qyI/50005 WHAT DO THEY DO HOW DO YOU START SOMETHING LIKE THAT
trainval/Rf8qS8gbfrw/50001 BUT THUMB BENDINESS OR HITCHHIKER THUMB IS ALSO DIFFERENT THAN THESE OTHER TRAITS AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE DON'T GIVE
trainval/Rf8qS8gbfrw/50002 MAYBE YOU WOULD INJURE YOURSELF DOING SO
trainval/Rf8qS8gbfrw/50003 TAKE A LOOK AT IT
trainval/Rf8qS8gbfrw/50004 WE MADE THIS UP
trainval/Rf8qS8gbfrw/50005 IT IS WHAT WE CALLED SOCIALLY CONSTRUCTED
trainval/Rf8qS8gbfrw/50006 COMPARE YOUR THUMB TO THOSE AROUND YOU
trainval/Rf8qS8gbfrw/50007 NOW MAYBE THIS IS BECAUSE RACE DOESN'T ACTUALLY MATTER IN NORWAY BUT I SUSPECT THAT'S NOT THE CASE UNFORTUNATELY
trainval/Rf8qS8gbfrw/50008 AND BEING FROM THE US DOES NOT EXPLAIN WHAT SHE EXPERIENCED HERE
trainval/Rf8qS8gbfrw/50009 AND THIS IS A TERRIBLE LINGUISTIC EQUIVALENCY
trainval/rFAdlU2ETjU/50001 IT'S EMPATHY THAT MAKES US HELP OTHER PEOPLE
trainval/rFAdlU2ETjU/50002 BUT IN HUMANS IT WAS ONLY KNOWN TO FACILITATE BIRTH AND BREASTFEEDING IN WOMEN AND IS RELEASED BY BOTH SEXES DURING
trainval/rFAdlU2ETjU/50003 THERE MUST BE A REASON WHY
trainval/rFAdlU2ETjU/50004 BUT HE WAS RIGHT IT WAS A STUPID IDEA
trainval/rFAdlU2ETjU/50005 FIRST OF ALL OXYTOCIN IS A SHY MOLECULE
trainval/rFAdlU2ETjU/50006 SO POOR COUNTRIES ARE BY AND LARGE LOW TRUST COUNTRIES
trainval/rFAdlU2ETjU/50007 WE NEED TO KNOW WHY PEOPLE ARE DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING
trainval/rFAdlU2ETjU/50008 BUT IN FACT ECONOMISTS WERE FLUMMOXED ON WHY THE SECOND PERSON WOULD EVER RETURN ANY MONEY
trainval/rFAdlU2ETjU/50009 I DIDN'T KNOW FOR SURE OXYTOCIN CAUSED TRUSTWORTHINESS
trainval/rFAdlU2ETjU/50010 I SAW THAT PEOPLE WHO WERE RELIGIOUS AND NON RELIGIOUS WERE EQUALLY OBSESSED WITH MORALITY
trainval/rFAdlU2ETjU/50011 WE SHOWED THAT OXYTOCIN INFUSION INCREASES GENEROSITY IN UNILATERAL MONETARY
trainval/rFAdlU2ETjU/50012 YES MY MOM WAS HAPPY ABOUT THAT LAST ONE
trainval/rFAdlU2ETjU/50013 AND HE SAID HEY I WAS IN THE MEN'S ROOM
trainval/rFAdlU2ETjU/50014 WELL THIS IS VERY VALUABLE
trainval/rFAdlU2ETjU/50015 WE HAVE TO FIND THE OWNER FOR THIS
trainval/rFAdlU2ETjU/50016 OH YOU'RE SAVING MY LIFE
trainval/rFAdlU2ETjU/50017 HERE'S MY PHONE NUMBER
trainval/rFAdlU2ETjU/50018 GET YOURSELF A FAT REWARD
trainval/rFAdlU2ETjU/50019 I'M IN HIGH SCHOOL
trainval/rFAdlU2ETjU/50020 SO THE WAY MANY CONS WORK IS NOT THAT THE CONMAN GETS THE VICTIM TO TRUST HIM IT'S THAT HE
trainval/rFAdlU2ETjU/50021 NOW WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
trainval/rFAdlU2ETjU/50022 YEAH I'VE BEEN WORRYING ABOUT THAT TOO
trainval/rFAdlU2ETjU/50023 LOVE SAYS EIGHT HUGS A DAY
trainval/RFArUQAQ4UU/50001 WE ALL HAVE A VOICE AND A PLACE IN THE FRAGMENTED SYSTEMS AROUND US
trainval/rfOMqehlSZA/50001 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/RG5QP2EVUVY/50001 ONE SAID TO ME OUR PEOPLE USED TO GATHER IN CAFES TO WATCH FOOTBALL OR SOCCER
trainval/rGaj2VImQec/50001 THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BAD UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE
trainval/rGaj2VImQec/50002 THIS I CANNOT TREAT
trainval/rGaj2VImQec/50003 HE HAD TO HAVE SOME MISTAKES
trainval/rGgoCm1hofM/50001 THE INCREASE OF HEIGHT OF 10CM DURING THE LAST FEW HUNDRED YEARS SEEMS TO HAVE
trainval/rGgoCm1hofM/50002 OBESITY CAN CAUSE DIABETES HEART DISEASE AND CANCER
trainval/rGgoCm1hofM/50003 SEEING AN ATTRACTIVE YOUNG LADY
trainval/rGgoCm1hofM/50004 AS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL ACTIVITY WAS ENORMOUS
trainval/rGgoCm1hofM/50005 THE NUMBER OF DISEASES THAT ARE TREATABLE BY EXERCISE IS
trainval/rGgoCm1hofM/50006 THIS WAS NEVER ANTICIPATED
trainval/RgqtrlixYR4/50001 NOW AS A SCIENTIST WHAT'S THE EVIDENCE FOR THIS
trainval/RgqtrlixYR4/50002 ALL FOR ONE
trainval/RgqtrlixYR4/50003 IT MAY SURPRISE YOU THAT IT'S NOT ONLY CLIMATE
trainval/RgqtrlixYR4/50004 WHAT ARE THE PLANETARY BOUNDARIES WITHIN WHICH WE CAN SAFELY OPERATE
trainval/RGRlkq4Xl1s/50001 BECAUSE ONCE THEY WERE ON BOARD THEY CALLED THEIR FRIENDS WHO CALLED THEIR FRIENDS WHO CALLED THEIR FRIENDS
trainval/RGRlkq4Xl1s/50002 ORG WEBSITE AND ALL THE SPOTS WE HAD ALREADY DONE
trainval/RGRlkq4Xl1s/50003 AND IF WE TEAM TOGETHER WE ARE A POWER THAT CAN INCITE CHANGE
trainval/RgtoZ2ue05w/50001 MY FATHER WAS A SAN FRANCISCAN
trainval/RgtoZ2ue05w/50002 WE WERE TO BE ROUNDED UP AND IMPRISONED IN TEN BARBED WIRE PRISON CAMPS
trainval/RgtoZ2ue05w/50003 MY MOTHER WAS BORN IN SACRAMENTO CALIFORNIA
trainval/RgubFcmvgDE/50001 SO I BECAME VEGAN
trainval/rHbjwH2Blfg/50001 HER GUTS WERE SWIMMING WITH PARASITIC WORMS
trainval/rHbjwH2Blfg/50002 HER BODY WAS RIDDLED WITH SECONDARY TUMORS
trainval/rHbjwH2Blfg/50003 NATURAL SELECTION IS SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST
trainval/rHbjwH2Blfg/50004 AND WHEN YOU HAVE A POPULATION OF FAST DIVIDING CANCER CELLS IF ONE OF THEM ACQUIRES NEW MUTATIONS WHICH ALLOW THEM
trainval/rHbjwH2Blfg/50005 BUT HOW CAN A CANCER SPREAD IN A POPULATION
trainval/RhgrbQmYOSY/50001 MARGARET THATCHER WAS MY MOTHER
trainval/RhgrbQmYOSY/50002 THE MOTHER AND BABY'S HOMES WERE OFTEN RUN BY NUNS
trainval/RhgrbQmYOSY/50003 I WAS STARTING TO STAY OUT A LITTLE BIT LATE ETC
trainval/RhgrbQmYOSY/50004 SO THIS WAS AN OPPORTUNITY
trainval/RhgrbQmYOSY/50005 THIS WAS AN OPPORTUNITY
trainval/RhgrbQmYOSY/50006 I DIDN'T SAY GOODBYE TO ANYBODY NOT MY MOTHER MY FATHER MY SISTERS MY BROTHERS MY AUNTS MY UNCLES MY COUSINS MY
trainval/RhgrbQmYOSY/50007 I WASN'T CHARGED FOR ANYTHING
trainval/RhgrbQmYOSY/50008 I HADN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG
trainval/RhgrbQmYOSY/50009 I HAVE TO TELL IT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ONE TO PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER
trainval/RhgrbQmYOSY/50011 I SAW LIGHT
trainval/RhgrbQmYOSY/50013 I FOUND ALL OF MY FAMILY IN MY ADULT LIFE
trainval/RhgrbQmYOSY/50014 I DON'T MEAN CHILDREN
trainval/RhgrbQmYOSY/50015 I MEAN THE CHILD OF THE STATE
trainval/RJ0ldeMS9SM/50001 ARE PRINT BOOKS DEAD
trainval/RJ0ldeMS9SM/50002 WHEN THEY START USING IT THEY DISCOVER SOMETHING RIGHT AWAY
trainval/RJ0ldeMS9SM/50003 THAT CHANGES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT
trainval/RJ0ldeMS9SM/50004 WE'RE GOING TO MAKE BOOKS SO MUCH MORE PERSONAL FOR YOU
trainval/RJ0ldeMS9SM/50005 THIS IS THE BOUNDARY OF WHAT THE BOOK CAN BE
trainval/rjECbQ1rSk0/50001 YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT THE ASTEROID APOPHIS
trainval/rjECbQ1rSk0/50002 THE EARTH'S GRAVITY IS GOING TO BEND THE ORBIT OF THIS THING SO MUCH
trainval/rjECbQ1rSk0/50003 THERE IS A MEDIAN POINT BETWEEN TINY ROCK AND GIGANTIC ROCK AND IN FACT IF ANY OF YOU HAVE EVER BEEN TO
trainval/rjECbQ1rSk0/50004 THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THE DINOSAUR KILLER DID
trainval/rjECbQ1rSk0/50005 THEY'RE JUST NOT BIG ENOUGH
trainval/rjECbQ1rSk0/50006 BUT THEY WILL DO GLOBAL ECONOMIC DAMAGE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO HIT NECESSARILY TO
trainval/rjECbQ1rSk0/50007 BUT WHAT'S THE SECOND STEP
trainval/rjECbQ1rSk0/50008 THE SECOND STEP IS IF WE SEE ONE HEADING TOWARD US WE HAVE TO STOP IT
trainval/rjECbQ1rSk0/50009 MOVE AND THE CAR GOES PAST YOU
trainval/rjECbQ1rSk0/50010 THAT MEANS WE CAN DO IT AGAIN
trainval/rjECbQ1rSk0/50011 THE PROBLEM IS IF YOU HIT THIS ASTEROID YOU'VE CHANGED THE ORBIT YOU MEASURE THE ORBIT THEN YOU FIND OUT OH
trainval/rjECbQ1rSk0/50012 RUSTY SCHWEICKART WHO WAS AN APOLLO 9 ASTRONAUT IS ON THIS
trainval/rjECbQ1rSk0/50013 I DON'T THINK APOPHIS IS A PROBLEM
trainval/rjECbQ1rSk0/50014 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/RjgBko1p5wY/50001 I THINK THE MAIN SHIFT IS THAT COMMUNITY WORK IS MORE
trainval/RjrS5EqZlUs/50001 NOW I LITERALLY SAT FOR HOURS AND HOURS BY MYSELF IN MY LIVING ROOM MAKING EVEN
trainval/RjrS5EqZlUs/50002 WHICH THEREFORE MEANT THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TO WAIT AND WATCH GLUE DRY
trainval/RjrS5EqZlUs/50003 IT KIND OF STUCK TOGETHER BY ITSELF
trainval/RjrS5EqZlUs/50004 SO I WANTED TO KNOW MORE
trainval/RjrS5EqZlUs/50005 WHAT ELSE COULD I DO WITH PAPER
trainval/RjrS5EqZlUs/50006 PEOPLE SAID TO US CAN I GO IN FIRST
trainval/RjrS5EqZlUs/50007 SO WHEN I'M FACING ON DOING SOMETHING REALLY MONOTONOUS AND REALLY LABORIOUS I HAVE TO WATCH
trainval/RjrS5EqZlUs/50008 FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION WAS SOMETHING I FOUND OUT ABOUT SO COMPLETELY ACCIDENTALLY WHILST AT
trainval/RjrS5EqZlUs/50009 WHILST I WAS MAKING SOME OF THESE TEENY TINY ROSES
trainval/RjrS5EqZlUs/50010 SO THEN I BECAME THAT PERSON TRYING TO WONDER HOW OR IF I COULD ASK MY FRIENDS TO
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50001 MOST OF THEM LOOK AT ME AND SAY
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50002 WHAT DO YOU MEAN
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50003 AND WHEN I TELL THEM
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50006 REMEMBER THE DOUBLE INCOME NO KIDS
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50007 THE BEST AGER THE GOLDEN AGER WE ARE ALL AWARE OF THEM
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50008 BUT HOW ABOUT THE SKIPPIES
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50009 WE LIKE CERTAIN THINGS
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50011 I'M NOT SURE
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50012 WITH SEX IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50013 APART FROM THAT THERE WAS THE DECADE OF THE BABY BOOMERS
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50014 SO NO SURPRISE THAT A NEW INDUSTRY DEVELOPED IN OUR COUNTRY
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50015 BEFORE THAT WE BASICALLY E
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50016 IT'S ALWAYS INTERESTING WHEN I ASK MY STUDENTS AT UNIVERSITY
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50017 SO 40 MORE USERS WITHIN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50018 BUT IF YOU ONLY HAVE A LOW EDUCATION ONLY ONE OUT OF THREE HAS THE CHANCE TO GO ONLINE
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50019 NOW THE PROBLEM IS NOT THAT DO NOT HAVE ACCESS
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50020 THE MOMENT YOU START WORKING YOU DO NOT HAVE THE TIME TO BE ONLINE ALL THE TIME
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50021 SO HOW ABOUT THE PRESENT
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50022 AND THE SECOND THING OF COURSE IS THE MOMENT YOU ARE GETTING MARRIED
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50023 BUT BACK TO MY TOPIC
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50024 THE FUTURE OF LEISURE TIME
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50025 WE ASK THE EASY AND VERY PROFOUND QUESTION
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50026 HAVING MORE TIME FOR THE FAMILY MORE TIME FOR THEIR FRIENDS MORE TIME FOR THEIR TEAM MATES FOR THEIR NEIGHBORS
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50027 ONLY ONE OUT OF FIVE GERMANS WOULD LIKE TO WATCH MORE TV
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50028 ONLY 24 WOULD LIKE TO USE THE INTERNET MORE OFTEN
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50029 HOW WILL THE FUTURE LOOK LIKE
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50030 YOU HAVE LIKE THIS VIRTUAL UMBILICAL CORD TO STAY IN CONTACT WITH YOUR FAMILY WITH YOUR FRIENDS EVEN WITH
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50031 TAKE FOR EXAMPLE TELEVISION
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50032 WE ARE DOING SO MANY THINGS
trainval/RjyxIsE3V2g/50033 TELEVISION IS ALWAYS RANKED NUMBER ONE
trainval/RKEvMcte768/50001 I WANTED TO BE A FARMER I'M FROM NEBRASKA
trainval/RKK7wGAYP6k/50001 BUT THAT WOULD ACTUALLY GET YOU ORIENTED PRETTY FAST RIGHT
trainval/RKK7wGAYP6k/50002 SO WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW IS I'M MAKING SOUNDS WITH MY MOUTH AS I'M EXHALING
trainval/RKK7wGAYP6k/50003 THERE ARE HUMANS AROUND THE WORLD WHO STAY ORIENTED REALLY WELL
trainval/rkKDvGA2UU0/50001 IT REMINDS ME OF HOME
trainval/rkKDvGA2UU0/50002 BUT HOW LONG ARE WE GOING TO HAVE THAT FOR
trainval/rkKDvGA2UU0/50003 SO I'M ELSPETH PENNY
trainval/RKmxL8VYy0M/50001 WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR NEGATIVE DATA
trainval/RKmxL8VYy0M/50002 FORTY SEVEN OUT OF THOSE 53 WERE UNREPLICABLE
trainval/RKmxL8VYy0M/50003 FIFTY PATIENTS GOT LORCAINIDE AND OF THOSE PATIENTS 10 DIED
trainval/RKmxL8VYy0M/50004 THESE DRUGS WERE BROUGHT TO MARKET
trainval/RKmxL8VYy0M/50005 BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT I WAS MISLED
trainval/RKmxL8VYy0M/50006 AND THEN THEY WENT TO SEE IF THESE TRIALS HAD BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE PEER REVIEWED ACADEMIC LITERATURE
trainval/RKmxL8VYy0M/50007 AND THIS IS WHAT THEY FOUND
trainval/RKmxL8VYy0M/50008 THAT WOULD MEAN THAT I WAS A CHANCER {LG}
trainval/RKmxL8VYy0M/50009 AND WHEN THAT RESPONSIBILITY IS DIFFUSED BETWEEN A WHOLE NETWORK OF RESEARCHERS ACADEMICS
trainval/RKmxL8VYy0M/50010 THE RESULTS WERE UNAVAILABLE TO THEM
trainval/RKmxL8VYy0M/50011 BUT PEOPLE DIDN'T BOTHER TO USE THOSE REGISTERS
trainval/RKmxL8VYy0M/50012 AND SO THEN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF MEDICAL JOURNAL EDITORS CAME ALONG AND THEY SAID OH WELL WE WILL HOLD THE LINE
trainval/RKmxL8VYy0M/50013 WE WON'T PUBLISH ANY JOURNALS WE WON'T PUBLISH ANY TRIALS UNLESS THEY'VE BEEN REGISTERED BEFORE THEY BEGAN
trainval/RKmxL8VYy0M/50014 WE CANNOT KNOW THE TRUE EFFECTS OF THE MEDICINES THAT WE PRESCRIBE IF WE DO NOT
trainval/RKmxL8VYy0M/50015 IF I FLIPPED A COIN 100 TIMES BUT THEN WITHHELD THE RESULTS FROM YOU FROM HALF OF THOSE
trainval/RKmxL8VYy0M/50016 BUT THAT WOULDN'T MEAN THAT I HAD A TWO HEADED COIN
trainval/rKtmsVa4Kvk/50001 I SAID EXCUSE ME
trainval/rKtmsVa4Kvk/50002 HOW DO I ERADICATE ANTS FROM MY GARDEN
trainval/rKtmsVa4Kvk/50003 BUT ERADICATE IS A BIG WORD
trainval/rKtmsVa4Kvk/50004 I MIGRATED INDEED I DID
trainval/rKtmsVa4Kvk/50005 HOW DO YOU SPELL THAT
trainval/rKtmsVa4Kvk/50006 FOR ALL THESE DECADES I'VE BEEN TRYING TO LOOK FOR MORE SENSIBLE ANSWERS AND TO GIVE INSECTS AND THE
trainval/rKtmsVa4Kvk/50007 SOME POLLINATORS ARE VERY LIBERAL IN WHAT THEY POLLINATE OTHERS ARE VERY SPECIFIC I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
trainval/rKtmsVa4Kvk/50008 WHERE DID YOU GET THE POLLEN ON YOUR BACK
trainval/rKtmsVa4Kvk/50009 WHERE DID YOU FIND THAT ORCHID AND HOW DO I GET THERE
trainval/rKtmsVa4Kvk/50010 THERE'S STUFF GOING ON ON THIS PLANET OF OURS THAT WE HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT
trainval/rKtmsVa4Kvk/50011 AND PEOPLE SAY
trainval/rKtmsVa4Kvk/50012 WE DON'T MIND INVERTEBRATES FROM THE SEA WE CALL THOSE
trainval/rKtmsVa4Kvk/50013 AND THAT'S A REAL SHAME BECAUSE THESE GUYS HAVE GOT PROTEIN THAT CONTAINS VIRTUALLY NO CHOLESTEROL IS VERY HIGH
trainval/rKtmsVa4Kvk/50014 HOW DO I KILL THIS
trainval/rKtmsVa4Kvk/50015 AREN'T YOU LUCKY YOU WEREN'T RAISED IN AN ANT'S NEST
trainval/rKtmsVa4Kvk/50016 WHO EATS THAT
trainval/rKtmsVa4Kvk/50017 GOD INVENTED CARPET BEETLES WELL BEFORE SHE INVENTED CARPETS
trainval/rKtmsVa4Kvk/50018 THE HARLEQUIN BEETLE FROM VENEZUELA HAS ITS OWN SPECIES OF PSEUDOSCORPION AND IT'S ACTUALLY MORE KINKIER
trainval/rKtmsVa4Kvk/50019 UNTIL HE'S GOT ABOUT 12 UP THERE
trainval/rKtmsVa4Kvk/50020 THAT WAY WE ALLOW TO BECOME A LITTLE BIT OF AN ALMOST 100 CLEAN AND GREEN COUNTRY BY GROWING OUR FOOD AT LEAST
trainval/rKtmsVa4Kvk/50021 THAT'S WHERE I'M LEAVING THAT
trainval/rKtmsVa4Kvk/50022 THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT THOUGH
trainval/rKtmsVa4Kvk/50023 THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF FIGURES AND THEY'RE IMPRESSIVE FIGURES
trainval/rKtmsVa4Kvk/50024 ROBERT COSTANZA IN 1997
trainval/rKtmsVa4Kvk/50025 SO WE NEED TO PUT ECO' BACK INTO ECONOMICS
trainval/RLh5CRUecfY/50001 TO O IS ALSO A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW THE POOR CAN BE INCREDIBLY INNOVATIVE AT DESIGNING
trainval/RLh5CRUecfY/50002 SHE EXPLAINED TO US THAT HER HUSBAND WAS ALCOHOLIC ABUSIVE AND ADULTEROUS
trainval/RLh5CRUecfY/50003 SO WE ASKED WHAT WOULD THAT BE LIKE
trainval/RLh5CRUecfY/50004 TO WATCH YOUR HUSBAND WASTE YOUR FAMILY'S MONEY AND TO SEE YOUR KIDS GO TO BED HUNGRY
trainval/RLh5CRUecfY/50005 WE LEARNED THROUGH OUR RESEARCH THAT THE FINANCIAL LIVES OF THE POOR ARE INCREDIBLY COMPLEX
trainval/RlQEoJaLQRA/50001 WE DISLIKE SCOLDING VOICES
trainval/RlQEoJaLQRA/50002 IT'S BEAUTIFUL AND IT'S FUNCTIONAL
trainval/RlQEoJaLQRA/50003 WE DO IT ANYWAY
trainval/RlQEoJaLQRA/50004 THE BRAIN WORKS DIFFERENTLY IF YOU'RE HAPPY
trainval/RlQEoJaLQRA/50006 BEHAVIORAL IS SUBCONSCIOUS YOU'RE UNAWARE OF IT
trainval/RlQEoJaLQRA/50007 OR WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT
trainval/RlQEoJaLQRA/50008 I DON'T UNDERSTAND
trainval/RlQEoJaLQRA/50009 SO THAT'S THE NEW ME
trainval/RlToQQfSlLA/50001 WE ENDED UP BETTER GET TOGETHER WITH FRIENDS
trainval/rmeGVhhbGrM/50001 THINGS DON'T ALWAYS WORK ACCORDING TO PLAN
trainval/rmeGVhhbGrM/50002 AND LET ME TELL YOU NOT A LOT OF THOSE AUDITIONS ACTUALLY TRANSLATED INTO OFFERS BUT IT TURNED
trainval/rmeGVhhbGrM/50003 BUT I REALIZED THAT I SHOULDN'T GIVE UP AND I KEPT AT IT AND I'M GLAD THAT I DID
trainval/rmeGVhhbGrM/50004 BUT JUST BECAUSE SIX OF THEM SAID NO TO YOU IN A ROW DOESN'T MEAN YOU'LL GIVE UP ON GOING HOME RIGHT
trainval/rmeGVhhbGrM/50005 I NEED SOMEBODY TO HOLD THE CAMERA
trainval/rmeGVhhbGrM/50006 EVERYONE DOES NOT HAVE A CHALKED OUT PATH
trainval/rmeGVhhbGrM/50007 WHEN I STARTED WITH THE INTERNET WHICH WAS ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO WE'D ALL BEEN USED
trainval/rmeGVhhbGrM/50008 BUT WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID I USED TO HAVE REALLY SHORT HAIR
trainval/rmeGVhhbGrM/50009 EVENTUALLY I REALIZED THAT IT WAS OK TO NOT DO WHAT SHE WAS DOING AND SHE WAS STILL GOING TO BE PROUD OF
trainval/rmeGVhhbGrM/50010 ALBERT EINSTEIN ONCE SAID
trainval/rmeGVhhbGrM/50011 THAT CUP SONG THAT HAPPENED ON A WHIM TOO
trainval/RmXiItk49Gw/50001 I JUST DID A SEVEN COUNTRY SOLO TOUR
trainval/RmXiItk49Gw/50002 I WAS IN OMAN AND I WAS IN SAUDI ARABIA
trainval/RmXiItk49Gw/50003 I WAS IN DUBAI
trainval/RmXiItk49Gw/50004 AND IT'S GREAT THERE'S GOOD PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
trainval/RmXiItk49Gw/50005 FOR EXAMPLE DUBAI COOL PLACE
trainval/RmXiItk49Gw/50006 THEY HAVE A MALL THERE THE DUBAI MALL
trainval/RmXiItk49Gw/50007 IT'S THREE MILES AWAY
trainval/RmXiItk49Gw/50008 OUT OF MY WAY
trainval/RmXiItk49Gw/50009 LIKE IN THE DUBAI MALL THEY SELL FROZEN YOGURT BY THE GRAM
trainval/RmXiItk49Gw/50010 FOR EXAMPLE I TOOK MY TWO YEAR OLD SON TO THE PLAYGROUND AT THE DUBAI MALL
trainval/RmXiItk49Gw/50012 AND I'VE BEEN GUILTY OF STEREOTYPING AS WELL
trainval/RmXiItk49Gw/50013 I WAS IN DUBAI
trainval/RmXiItk49Gw/50015 WHERE I'VE HAD PROBLEMS IS IN SOME OF THE ARAB COUNTRIES
trainval/RmXiItk49Gw/50016 HE WENT OUT SOLO AND DID IT FIRST
trainval/RmXiItk49Gw/50017 I'LL BE BACK AND HE WALKED AWAY
trainval/RmXiItk49Gw/50018 CAN YOU SAY I WILL KILL YOU IN THE NAME OF ALLAH
trainval/RmXiItk49Gw/50019 I WANT TO ROB A BANK
trainval/RmXiItk49Gw/50020 THAT'S WHAT I TRY AND SHOW IN MY STAND UP GOOD PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
trainval/RmXiItk49Gw/50021 ALL IT TAKES IN ONE PERSON TO MESS IT UP
trainval/RmXiItk49Gw/50024 I WAS DOING A SHOW AND THEY SAID WE'LL SEND A DRIVER TO PICK YOU UP
trainval/RmXiItk49Gw/50025 I WENT DOWN TO THE LOBBY AND SAW THIS INDIAN GUY
trainval/RmXiItk49Gw/50026 I GO I'M SORRY
trainval/rN7VcY1fS1Q/50001 WHAT WE FOUND HOWEVER WAS THAT THEY TOOK AN EXTREMELY LONG TIME OVER 20 YEARS TO REGENERATE
trainval/rN7VcY1fS1Q/50002 WE KNOW IT'S A LOT BUT WE DO NOT YET KNOW THE ANSWERS TO HOW MUCH AND BY WHAT PROCESSES CARBON
trainval/rN7VcY1fS1Q/50003 OR PERHAPS AL GORE AND NATURALLY 7 COULD MAKE A SONG ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE THAT WOULD REALLY
trainval/rN7VcY1fS1Q/50004 TO GO OUT TO TREES TO GO OUT TO FORESTS TO GO OUT TO NATURE TO MAKE NEW DISCOVERIES
trainval/rni41c9iq54/50001 HE WAS STANDING ON A STOOL BY THE SINK BRUSHING HIS TEETH WHEN HE SLIPPED AND SCRATCHED HIS
trainval/rni41c9iq54/50002 HE CRIED FOR A MINUTE BUT THEN HE GOT BACK UP GOT BACK ON THE STOOL AND REACHED OUT FOR A BOX OF
trainval/rni41c9iq54/50003 WE'VE KNOWN IT SINCE WE WERE FIVE YEARS OLD
trainval/rni41c9iq54/50004 I STUMBLED OUT OF BED I PUT THE PHONE BACK ON THE RECEIVER AND IT RANG A SECOND LATER AND IT WAS MY
trainval/rni41c9iq54/50005 I WAS IN THE GRIPS OF REAL LONELINESS BACK THEN BUT I WAS SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE ALL DAY SO IT
trainval/rni41c9iq54/50006 AND THAT IS HOW MUCH MORE WE VALUE THE BODY THAN WE DO THE MIND
trainval/rni41c9iq54/50007 OUR MIND IS HARD TO CHANGE ONCE WE BECOME CONVINCED
trainval/rni41c9iq54/50008 I BELIEVE OUR QUALITY OF LIFE COULD RISE JUST AS DRAMATICALLY IF WE ALL BEGAN PRACTICING
trainval/ro1Ksq5DihU/50001 HAVE YOU EVER TRIED TO CHANGE SOMETHING BUT FAILED MISERABLY
trainval/ro1Ksq5DihU/50002 IT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF SITTING BACK AND WATCHING POOLS DEVELOPING A DAM OVER TIME
trainval/ro1Ksq5DihU/50003 IN FACT OUR TRAINING DRIVES INTO US THE PRINCIPLE OF DO NO HARM
trainval/ro1Ksq5DihU/50004 REDUCE THE RISKS
trainval/ro1Ksq5DihU/50005 GO SEE WHAT IT IS LIKE IN THEIR SETTING
trainval/ro1Ksq5DihU/50006 NOW I KNOW THIS SOUNDS CLICHE BUT FEW LEADERS ACTUALLY FOLLOW IT
trainval/ro1Ksq5DihU/50007 OK SO YOU'VE SURVEYED YOUR ENVIRONMENT BUILT RELATIONSHIPS AND TRUST AND NOW YOU ARE THAT LONE
trainval/ro1Ksq5DihU/50008 WITH HEALTH LINKS WE INVITED DOCTORS NURSES NURSE PRACTITIONERS DIETICIANS CASE MANAGERS
trainval/ro1Ksq5DihU/50009 THEN THERE IS MAJORITY A LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE
trainval/ro1Ksq5DihU/50010 WHAT MOST LEADERS DO IS MAKE A BIG MISTAKE
trainval/rokPqHc9iD0/50001 IN OTHER WORDS 10 TIMES MORE PEOPLE ARE DYING OUTSIDE OF WAR THAN INSIDE WAR
trainval/rokPqHc9iD0/50002 TOKYO WITH 35 MILLION PEOPLE IS ONE OF THE LARGEST AND SOME MIGHT SAY SAFEST URBAN
trainval/rokPqHc9iD0/50003 IF YOU LIVE IN RIO I'M SORRY SHAVE OFF TWO RIGHT THERE
trainval/rokPqHc9iD0/50004 BUT WE'RE FACING A STARK DILEMMA WHERE SOME CITIES ARE GOING TO THRIVE AND DRIVE GLOBAL GROWTH
trainval/rokPqHc9iD0/50005 WE'VE GOT TO GET AWAY FROM THIS MODEL OF SEGREGATION EXCLUSION AND CITIES WITH WALLS
trainval/RoS2q3pSrq4/50001 AT OUR HUMAN RIGHT CENTER AT GENT UNIVERSITY WE DID LEGAL RESEARCH ON THAT CHECKING THE PROPOSED BAN
trainval/RoS2q3pSrq4/50002 AND WHEN THESE UNITED NATIONS BODIES TALK TO THE FRENCH REPUBLIC AND ISSUE THEIR VERY
trainval/rOVkASt39Uc/50001 NOW WE'RE AIMING TO MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTE BOATS AND BOAT KITS BY THE END OF THIS YEAR
trainval/rOVkASt39Uc/50002 I WAS ABLE TO USE PRECOMPILED CODE LIBRARIES AND FOLLOW OTHER SCHEMATICS AND IN DOING SO I WAS ABLE TO
trainval/rOVkASt39Uc/50003 IT'S FROM THESE OPEN COLLABORATIVE COMMUNITIES THAT COMES THE AMAZING POTENTIAL BUT IT'S
trainval/ROW9FSc0kIQ/50001 HECK WE EVEN INVENTED THIS NEW MATERIAL FIRST BEFORE WE MADE THIS MESS SO
trainval/ROXUPr8Wqds/50001 IT'S THE EROSION OF GRANITE ROCK
trainval/ROXUPr8Wqds/50002 THE DARK AREAS ARE LAVA FLOWS
trainval/rPh3c8Sa37M/50001 IT'S AN ELEMENT OF ALMOST EVERY SPIRITUAL TRADITION OF HUMANKIND THROUGHOUT ALL OF HISTORY
trainval/rPh3c8Sa37M/50002 BUT WHENEVER I HEAR PEOPLE TALK AND MENTION THIS PHRASE THAT WE ARE ALL CONNECTED THEY DO SO IN
trainval/rPh3c8Sa37M/50003 AND TODAY I'M HERE TO DESCRIBE THAT EVERYTHING REALLY IS CONNECTED AND NOT IN SOME ABSTRACT
trainval/rPh3c8Sa37M/50004 AND THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY A CENTRAL PART OF THE HEMOGLOBIN MOLECULE BECAUSE THIS IS THE THING THAT ALLOWS US TO BIND
trainval/rPh3c8Sa37M/50006 EVEN THOUGH THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT STARS FORM ONE OF THE MOST ROBUST IS THIS PROCESS
trainval/rPh3c8Sa37M/50007 BECAUSE WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD GALAXIES COLLIDE
trainval/rPh3c8Sa37M/50008 AND IT WAS A VERY SLOW PROCESS
trainval/rPh3c8Sa37M/50009 AND ONE OF THOSE GAPS THAT I'VE SEEN IS AROUND THIS CONCEPT AND THE CONCEPT IS A REALLY SIMPLE ONE
trainval/rPh3c8Sa37M/50010 WELL ACTUALLY THEY NEVER REALLY LEFT US
trainval/rPh3c8Sa37M/50011 AND THEY'RE NOW CALLED CHLOROPLASTS
trainval/rPh3c8Sa37M/50012 I MEAN I HAD NO PURPOSE IN THIS LIFE
trainval/rPh3c8Sa37M/50013 LIKE THE WORLD I CAME TO IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE WORLD THAT I LEFT
trainval/rPh3c8Sa37M/50014 AND IT'S WORTH THINKING THAT MAYBE THE MEANING OF OUR LIVES ARE ACTUALLY NOT EVEN WITHIN THE SCOPE OF OUR UNDERSTANDING
trainval/rPh3c8Sa37M/50015 IT REQUIRED A DEPTH OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
trainval/rPh3c8Sa37M/50016 IT WAS A COLOR IN THE PALETTE OF BEING THAT YOU COULDN'T PAINT WITH
trainval/rPh3c8Sa37M/50017 A SELF DRIVING CAR
trainval/rPh3c8Sa37M/50018 IT MIGHT COME FROM THE WAY THAT YOU EXPRESS YOURSELF AS A HUMAN BEING
trainval/rPh3c8Sa37M/50019 IT MIGHT COME FROM A PIECE OF ARTWORK THAT YOU CREATE
trainval/rPh3c8Sa37M/50020 EACH ONE OF THESE WAYS OF BEING THESE THINGS THAT WE PUT OUT INTO THE WORLD THROUGH THE CREATIVE PROCESS OF MIXING
trainval/rPh3c8Sa37M/50021 IT SAYS THAT THE WAY THAT WE ARE IN OUR LIVES THE WAY THAT WE AFFECT OUR FRIENDS AND OUR FAMILY BEGIN TO
trainval/RPicL1AWrs8/50001 VAN MEEGEREN WAS CHARGED WITH THE CRIME OF TREASON WHICH IS ITSELF PUNISHABLE BY DEATH
trainval/RPicL1AWrs8/50002 WELL THERE'S AN ANSWER THAT MANY PEOPLE WOULD GIVE
trainval/RPicL1AWrs8/50003 I DON'T DOUBT THAT THAT PLAYS SOME ROLE BUT WHAT I WANT TO CONVINCE YOU OF TODAY IS THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON
trainval/RPicL1AWrs8/50004 SUFFERERS OF CAPGRAS SYNDROME BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE THEY LOVE MOST IN THE WORLD HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY PERFECT DUPLICATES
trainval/RPicL1AWrs8/50005 NOW OFTEN A RESULT OF CAPGRAS SYNDROME IS TRAGIC
trainval/RPicL1AWrs8/50006 PEOPLE HAVE MURDERED THOSE THAT THEY LOVED BELIEVING THAT THEY WERE MURDERING AN IMPOSTER
trainval/RPicL1AWrs8/50007 RATHER IT'S BECAUSE I WANT SOMETHING THAT HAS A SPECIFIC HISTORY
trainval/RPicL1AWrs8/50008 AND THEY THEN REPORTED THAT HER FATHER WAS COACHING HER
trainval/RPicL1AWrs8/50009 BECAUSE THIS WOMAN COMES UP YOU SEE AT THE END OF THE VIDEO SHE COMES UP
trainval/RPicL1AWrs8/50011 THE FIRST SHOCK IS RECORDED AS VERY PAINFUL
trainval/RPjqPHCMJHU/50001 INSTEAD I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO AT LEAST SOMEHOW THE YEAR OF THE INSURANCE
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50001 NO ONE IN MY EXTENDED AND TIGHT KNIT FAMILY SPOKE WITH MY AUNT EXCEPT FOR MY MOM
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50002 WHEN I GREW OLDER I HEARD STORIES
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50003 AND ONE WOMAN SAID IT MEANS HAVING A VOICE OR SAY IN WHAT GOES ON IN YOUR COUNTRY OR WHERE YOU LIVE
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50004 BUT THE WOMEN IN THE PRISON HAD VERY LITTLE SAY ABOUT WHAT WENT ON WHERE THEY CURRENTLY LIVED
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50005 AND EVEN WHEN THEY GOT OUT THEY COULD BE BARRED FROM VOTING OR HOUSING IF THEY HAD A FELONY CONVICTION
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50006 ALTHOUGH IT WASN'T WHAT YOU'D EXPECT
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50007 THESE WERE THE STORIES THAT MATTERED
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50008 THEY WERE INSPIRED BY THE RADICALS REFORMERS AND DREAMERS WE HAD READ ABOUT THROUGHOUT THE SEMESTER TO CREATE THEIR
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50009 BUT AT THE VERY TOP THEY HAD WRITTEN
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50010 TO EMPOWER WOMEN THROUGH EDUCATION
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50011 AN IMPOSING BUILDING SET OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50012 I WAS TOO BUSY WORKING AS A PROFESSOR
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50013 I FELT GALVANIZED
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50014 I FELT LIKE I WAS DOING WHAT I'D WANTED TO DO ALL THOSE YEARS AGO WHEN I TAUGHT MY CLASS IN NEW YORK
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50015 WHY SHOULDN'T WOMEN HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50016 WOMEN IN PRISON MIGHT BE JUST A SMALL PROPORTION OF THE TOTAL PRISON POPULATION BUT THEY ARE THE FASTEST GROWING
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50017 IT SEEMED LIKE THE CYCLE WAS JUST REPEATING ITSELF
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50018 I KNOW THAT OVER 80 OF THE WOMEN WHO TAKE OUR COLLEGE CLASSES AT THIS PRISON ARE MOTHERS TOO
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50019 THERE'S A PROVERB THAT SAYS
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50020 IF YOU EDUCATE A WOMAN YOU EDUCATE A NATION
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50021 AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50022 IT WAS A TOUGH ON CRIME PERIOD
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50023 WASHINGTON FOLLOWED SUIT AND BANNED ALL STATE PUBLIC FUNDS FOR COLLEGE IN PRISON
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50024 TO MEN AND WOMEN IN PRISON I WOULD URGE YOU TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PRISON TO OFFER
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50025 IT WAS A COLLEGE CLASS I'D TAUGHT BEFORE ALTHOUGH NEVER IN A PRISON
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50026 BUT WHY CAN'T YOU IMAGINE BEING A SCIENTIST OR A WRITER
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50027 TO ALL OF YOU I WOULD ASK
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50028 CAN WE IMAGINE DIFFERENTLY
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50029 CAN WE IMAGINE A WORLD WHERE EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO A QUALITY EDUCATION NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50030 MY AUNT GOT OUT OF PRISON
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50031 EVEN A HORTICULTURIST AND A COSMETOLOGIST WILL GO THAT MUCH FARTHER WITH A COLLEGE DEGREE
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50032 IT REALLY BOTHERED A LOT OF MY STUDENTS THAT THEY HAD TO LOOK AT A VISIBLE SYMBOL OF FREEDOM FROM BEHIND BARS
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50033 INSTEAD THEY'RE OUT THERE IN THE WORLD
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50034 WHEN THAT HAPPENS I THINK WE WILL HAVE MADE PRISONS A POINT OF DEPARTURE
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50035 IT'S WORKING IN THIS PRISON AND IT CAN WORK ELSEWHERE
trainval/Rpsf1YJsbbI/50036 AS A TEACHER IN A PRISON YOU WON'T HAVE FANCY TECHNOLOGY AND YOU WON'T HAVE THE INTERNET
trainval/rptMkkcM9Sk/50001 YOU HAVE TO TAKE RISKS ALSO
trainval/rQNisRKhSiU/50001 I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE BIG IDEAS BEHIND IT AND WHY IT MATTERS SO MUCH
trainval/rQNisRKhSiU/50003 FOR MY PART I'D SAY IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PROJECT I'VE EVER WORKED ON
trainval/rQSSSLRpsVs/50001 THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO GET RID OF
trainval/rQSSSLRpsVs/50002 I STEPPED OUT OF THE VEHICLE AND I STARTED MY PROCESS
trainval/rQSSSLRpsVs/50003 I TOOK A DEEP BREATH
trainval/rQSSSLRpsVs/50004 MOVE FORWARD WITH YOUR ACTION PLAN
trainval/rQSSSLRpsVs/50005 THE BARBER SAID TO ME KINJA YOU ARE TAKING THIS VERY VERY WELL
trainval/rQSSSLRpsVs/50006 I DECIDED TO SEND A TEXT ARE YOU OK
trainval/rQSSSLRpsVs/50007 I GOT A TEXT BACK I'M TIRED
trainval/rQSSSLRpsVs/50008 I TOOK A DEEP BREATH
trainval/rQSSSLRpsVs/50009 NOW THIS BLEW MY MIND BECAUSE THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I WAS YOUNG I USED TO WORRY SO MUCH AS A TEENAGER I
trainval/rQSSSLRpsVs/50010 HOW CAN YOU TURN THIS PAIN INTO POSITIVE PRODUCTION
trainval/rQSSSLRpsVs/50011 NOW THERE WAS A TIME I WOULD HAVE HANDLED THIS ALL WRONG
trainval/rRepnhXq33s/50001 SO IF I WERE TO PLAY THIS
trainval/rRepnhXq33s/50002 MUSIC IS VERY POWERFUL AND UNFORTUNATELY IT'S VENEERING COMMERCIAL SPACES OFTEN INAPPROPRIATELY
trainval/rRepnhXq33s/50003 I HOPE THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS
trainval/rRepnhXq33s/50004 8 BILLION TIMES A DAY THAT TUNE IS PLAYED
trainval/rRepnhXq33s/50005 THAT'S AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE UP OR DOWN
trainval/rRepnhXq33s/50006 IT'S GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH AND FOR YOUR PRODUCTIVITY
trainval/rRepnhXq33s/50007 IF WE ALL DO THAT WE MOVE TO A STATE THAT I LIKE TO THINK WILL BE SOUND LIVING IN THE WORLD
trainval/rrkrvAUbU9Y/50001 THAT'S NOT HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK RIGHT
trainval/rrkrvAUbU9Y/50002 IT'S BUILT MUCH MORE AROUND INTRINSIC MOTIVATION
trainval/rrkrvAUbU9Y/50003 WORK ON ANYTHING YOU WANT
trainval/rrkrvAUbU9Y/50004 RADICAL AMOUNTS OF AUTONOMY
trainval/RRRDYBwjjU0/50001 BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT
trainval/RRRDYBwjjU0/50002 IT DOESN'T SOLVE ANY PROBLEMS
trainval/RRRDYBwjjU0/50003 BUT INSTEAD JUDGE PEOPLE BY THEIR ACTIONS AND NOT BY THEIR FAITH
trainval/rRxdxIbSQbY/50001 YOU GUYS DON'T THINK ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE RIGHT
trainval/rRxdxIbSQbY/50002 YOU THINK THIS IS JUST BIG GRANDIOSE TALK
trainval/rRxdxIbSQbY/50003 I BELIEVE THAT YOU AND I ARE CAPABLE OF WORLD CHANGE RADICAL WORLD CHANGE
trainval/rRxdxIbSQbY/50004 AND YET IT HAPPENED DIDN'T IT
trainval/rRxdxIbSQbY/50005 HE HAD ONLY HAD HIS PILOT'S LICENSE FOR TWO YEARS BEFORE HE MADE THAT MOMENTOUS FLIGHT
trainval/rRxdxIbSQbY/50006 AT XPRIZE WE DESIGN AND LAUNCH LARGE SCALE AUDACIOUS COMPETITIONS
trainval/Rs5CDLgjSsI/50001 AND IT'S ALSO AN ANCIENT QUESTION
trainval/Rs5CDLgjSsI/50002 WE COULD GET IT ANYWHERE ANYTIME
trainval/Rs5CDLgjSsI/50003 ALONE OR APART
trainval/Rs5CDLgjSsI/50004 BUT YOU KNOW TECHNOLOGY
trainval/Rs5CDLgjSsI/50005 ALL RIGHT I KNOW THAT THE INTERNET AND TELEPHONE TECHNOLOGY PROBABLY HAVE US MORE CONNECTED THAN WE EVER HAVE
trainval/Rs5CDLgjSsI/50006 AND SO DOES THE TECHNOLOGY
trainval/Rs5CDLgjSsI/50009 THEY'RE SHARING SOUND
trainval/RS5O4n0TqlU/50001 WHICH AGAIN TECHNICAL TERM FOR SOMETHING THAT'S NOT THAT TECHNICAL
trainval/RS5O4n0TqlU/50002 WE'RE PROJECTING A VERSION OF OURSELVES ONTO THE INTERNET
trainval/RS5O4n0TqlU/50003 SO THERE IS NO TRADITIONAL BULLYING ROTA WHERE YOU GO HOME AT NIGHT AND
trainval/RS5O4n0TqlU/50004 WE HAVE ACCESS TO 4G TABLETS SMARTPHONES LAPTOPS
trainval/RS5O4n0TqlU/50005 AND YES IT'S ALL SCRIPTED BY THE WAY EVEN THIS RELAXED OFF THE CUFF' BIT HAS BEEN PEER
trainval/rSfHY43qLWs/50001 AND EFFICIENT TO WHOM
trainval/RsiLLNziScM/50001 SO THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT STUDENTS FIRST AIMS TO TRY TO DO IS BALANCE THAT EQUATION OUT AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE
trainval/RsiLLNziScM/50002 AND THE WHOLE IDEA BEHIND STUDENTS FIRST IS A SIMPLE ONE AND IT IS THAT
trainval/RsiLLNziScM/50003 IS THAT REALLY RIGHT
trainval/RsiLLNziScM/50004 WHAT'S THE PROBLEM
trainval/RsiLLNziScM/50005 WHERE IS ALL OF THIS MONEY GOING
trainval/RsiLLNziScM/50006 BECAUSE HIS THEORY WAS
trainval/RsiLLNziScM/50007 AND LET ME TELL YOU WHY
trainval/RSl1ramE35s/50001 HE WAS TELLING ME TO LIVE IN MY STRENGTH WHETHER I CALL THAT GOD SPIRIT COURAGE
trainval/RSl1ramE35s/50002 AND REFLECTING BACK ON THAT SITUATION I ALSO REALIZED THAT WHEN HE WAS DELIVERING THE FAITH
trainval/RSl1ramE35s/50003 AND HE SHARED SOMETHING WITH ME THAT WAS VERY INSIGHTFUL
trainval/RSl1ramE35s/50004 THE LABEL IS BASICALLY I SLIP INTO ACCEPTING LABELS WHEN I BECOME
trainval/RSl1ramE35s/50005 DRUNKEN MONKEY WANTS YOU TO TAKE SHORTCUTS
trainval/RSl1ramE35s/50006 SO WE LIKE THAT
trainval/RSl1ramE35s/50007 SO IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO BE AWARE OF THAT AND TO LIMIT
trainval/RSl1ramE35s/50008 OK HE NEEDS TO BE CHALLENGED AND HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT
trainval/RSl1ramE35s/50009 USE IT ON A DAILY BASIS AND YOU WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE AND THE WORLD AROUND YOU IN MANY WONDERFUL WAYS
trainval/rSqYQXRVP0k/50001 IT'S MORE POWERFUL
trainval/rSqYQXRVP0k/50002 THIS IS A POEM ABOUT MARK ANTONY
trainval/RSW3xi2jMYI/50001 AND IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO TAKE ANY OF THOSE BIRDS AND PUT THEM INTO A CAGE SO SMALL THAT THEY COULD NEVER STRETCH A WING
trainval/RSW3xi2jMYI/50002 I LOVED THAT SHEEP
trainval/RSW3xi2jMYI/50003 BACK THEN I ALSO HAPPENED TO BE A BIG FAN OF THE TELEVISION SERIES STAR TREK
trainval/RSW3xi2jMYI/50004 THAT'S A QUESTION THAT I THINK WE ALL OUGHT TO ASK OURSELVES
trainval/RSW3xi2jMYI/50005 HOW CAN WE DO THE MOST GOOD AND THE LEAST HARM TO PEOPLE ANIMALS AND THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH ALL OF OUR
trainval/RSW3xi2jMYI/50006 NOTE THE WAYS IN WHICH YOU'RE LIKE
trainval/RSW3xi2jMYI/50007 UNLESS SOMEBODY TELLS US WE WOULD NEVER KNOW
trainval/rtcrqLWZrS0/50001 HOW DID WE ALL GET SO LUCKY
trainval/rtcrqLWZrS0/50002 BY BEING HERE LISTENING ALIVE A MEMBER OF A GROWING SPECIES YOU ARE ONE OF
trainval/rtcrqLWZrS0/50003 THE EXTINCTION WAS A FILTER
trainval/rtcrqLWZrS0/50004 IT MERELY LEVELED THE PLAYING FIELD
trainval/rtcrqLWZrS0/50005 HOWEVER IT IS ALREADY CLEAR THAT YOUR ANCESTORS' SURVIVAL THROUGH MASS EXTINCTION
trainval/RtFFT4zjyTM/50001 HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE A WILL
trainval/RtFFT4zjyTM/50002 PUT YOUR HAND UP
trainval/RtFFT4zjyTM/50003 AND I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT INNOVATION HAS TOUCHED THE WORLD OF CORPSE DISPOSAL
trainval/RtFFT4zjyTM/50004 I CALL IT MY INVESTMENT PROPERTY
trainval/rThUrXYaneo/50001 SO I'M A HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR AND THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS I HAVE WORKED ON
trainval/rThUrXYaneo/50002 A CONVICTION REVIEW UNIT IS ESSENTIALLY A UNIT IN A PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE WHERE PROSECUTORS
trainval/rThUrXYaneo/50003 SO WE TOOK A CLOSE LOOK
trainval/rThUrXYaneo/50004 I SPOKE TO MR
trainval/rThUrXYaneo/50005 MCCALLUM ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO
trainval/rThUrXYaneo/50006 I WENT TO NEW YORK
trainval/rThUrXYaneo/50007 AND ONE OF THE THINGS HE SAID WHEN WE MET WITH HIM IS THAT HE NOW HAS DEDICATED
trainval/rTJpJlVkRTA/50001 SHE WAS A SINGLE FEMALE PARENT
trainval/rTJpJlVkRTA/50002 THE REALITY IS A GENDER FLUIDITY THAT CROSSES THE ENTIRE CONTINUUM FROM MALE TO
trainval/rTJpJlVkRTA/50003 I WOULD SAY IN SOME WAYS I CHANGE MY GENDER ABOUT AS OFTEN AS I CHANGE MY HAIRSTYLE
trainval/rTJpJlVkRTA/50004 THIS IS JUST SOMETHING WE TRIED IN RATS
trainval/rTJpJlVkRTA/50005 AND THEY GAVE ME LIKE A LITTLE PLASTIC ZIPLOC BAG OF A SMALL AMOUNT OF POWDER
trainval/rTJpJlVkRTA/50007 THERE'S SOME 3000 PEOPLE A YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE PERHAPS 10 TIMES THAT NUMBER
trainval/rTJpJlVkRTA/50008 I'M AS CERTAIN OF THAT AS I WAS OF THE SUCCESS THAT WE'VE HAD WITH DIRECT TELEVISION BROADCASTING
trainval/rTJpJlVkRTA/50009 THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO DO IN THIS LIFE AND IF WE COULD HAVE A SIMULACRUM A DIGITAL
trainval/rTJpJlVkRTA/50010 AND SO FOR US THE PROSPECT OF MIND CLONES AND REGENERATED BODIES IS THAT OUR LOVE
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50001 IF WE DID IT ALL OVER AGAIN HOW WOULD YOU DO IT
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50002 WE WANT THEM TO AIM FOR THE GREATEST HEALTH IMPACT
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50003 AND VICE VERSA
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50004 THAT'S HOW THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50005 THROUGH MARK UPS
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50006 DATA EXCLUSIVITY AND SO ON
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50007 A LOT OF MONEY GOES FOR GAMING WHERE BRAND NAME COMPANIES PAY GENERIC COMPANIES TO DELAY
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50008 A LOT OF MONEY GOES TO TAKE OUR PATENTS INTO ALL THE DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50009 MONEY GOES EVEN LARGER AMOUNTS NBSP FOR LITIGATION
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50011 PEOPLE SAY PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES MAKE A LOT OF PROFIT
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50012 DEADWEIGHT LOSSES I WON'T EVEN TELL YOU WHAT THEY ARE BECAUSE IT'S TOO COMPLICATED
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50013 A LOT OF THE MONEY THAT PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES MAKE GOES INTO ADVERTISING CAMPAIGNS TRYING TO WIN FAVOR
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50014 AND THESE MARKETING BATTLES OF COURSE ARE A PURE WASTE BECAUSE WHAT ONE COMPANY SPENDS TO GET PATIENTS OVER TO THEIR DRUG ANOTHER
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50015 AND THEN THERE IS COUNTERFEITING IN THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50016 A LOT OF THE DRUGS THERE OFTEN MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF WHAT'S SOLD ARE COUNTERFEIT DRUGS WHERE PEOPLE SAY BECAUSE THE
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50017 THEY WOULD BE REPLACED
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50018 THE POTENTIAL GAINS HERE ARE ENORMOUS
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50019 HOW CAN WE CHANGE THE SYSTEM
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50020 THEY HAVE A CHOICE
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50021 AND WITH EACH PARTICULAR MEDICINE THEY HAVE THEIR CHOICE
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50022 THAT REPEATS FOR TEN YEARS AND AT THE END OF THE TEN YEARS YOUR PRODUCT GOES GENERIC SO YOU
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50023 NOW IF YOU TAKE THAT REWARD FROM THE HEALTH IMPACT FUND YOU CAN'T CLAIM THE OTHER REWARD
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50024 SO SOME PEOPLE BEFORE THE MEDICINE CAME ALONG HAD NO TREATMENT AT ALL NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE TREATMENT BECAUSE
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50025 THAT'S IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE EXISTING SYSTEM WHERE YOU GET A LOT OF MONEY FOR SWITCHING SOMEBODY FROM
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50026 THE HEALTH IMPACT FUND DOES NOT PAY FOR THAT
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50027 YOU ALL KNOW HOW EXIT POLLING WORKS AND THIS IS A SIMILAR METHOD
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50028 TODAY MOST PACKAGED INSERTS ARE NOT EVEN TRANSLATED INTO LOCAL LANGUAGES AND SO IT'S NOT
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50029 NOW HOW WOULD THE FINANCING WORK
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50030 YOU PAY WITH ONE HAND THROUGH THE TAX SYSTEM BUT YOU GET SOMETHING BACK WITH THE OTHER HAND BECAUSE YOU
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50031 THIS IS NOT JUST FOR POOR PEOPLE
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50032 SO WHAT CAN WE DO
trainval/rTMqGbTNkNg/50033 SO THE RATE WILL ALWAYS BE AT A REASONABLE LEVEL
trainval/rToBZSrxjgM/50001 GENERALLY IF I THINK SOMETHING IS WRONG I QUERY IT THREE TIMES
trainval/rToBZSrxjgM/50002 I TOLD SANDY THAT NOT LONG AGO IN A MOMENT OF INDISCRETION AND HE SAID ONLY THREE
trainval/rToBZSrxjgM/50003 SO HE HAS LEARNED TO HOLD OUT
trainval/rToBZSrxjgM/50004 FIRST A GRAMMAR QUERY
trainval/rToBZSrxjgM/50005 EVERY PUBLICATION HAS A HOUSE STYLE
trainval/rToBZSrxjgM/50006 EVERYONE WAS THERE
trainval/RtRufOPFug0/50001 AND WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT
trainval/RtRufOPFug0/50002 ARE YOU GOOD AT IT
trainval/RtRufOPFug0/50003 THAT MEANS IF YOU WANT TO SAVE LIVES YOU CAN DO IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY
trainval/rueQgStScw0/50001 THEN A CELL MAY DIVIDE WHEN IT SHOULD'VE INSTEAD STAYED IN STASIS OR EVEN MORE LIKELY SHOULD'VE BEEN TAKEN OUT OF THE POPULATION
trainval/rueQgStScw0/50002 IN FACT SOME OF THE EARLIEST DISCOVERED HUMAN TISSUES IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES ARE RIDDLED WITH TUMORS AND SOME OF THE
trainval/rueQgStScw0/50003 WELL THEY HAVE TO BECOME INCREDIBLY RELIANT ON A FEW PROTEINS
trainval/rueQgStScw0/50004 EACH CANCER CELL IS INCREDIBLY DIFFERENT FROM EVERY OTHER ONE
trainval/rueQgStScw0/50005 THAT CANCER THEN GOES THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE BODY EVENTUALLY CAUSING ORGAN FAILURE AND DEATH AMONG A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER
trainval/rueQgStScw0/50006 THEN WE ARE ABLE TO CALCULATE FOR SOMETHING CALLED SYNERGY
trainval/rueQgStScw0/50007 SINCE THEY'RE BOTH DNA DAMAGE RESPONSE PROTEINS WE'RE DIRECTLY TARGETING THE HALLMARKS OF CANCER
trainval/rueQgStScw0/50008 TWO OF THE MOST IMPORTANT HALLMARKS OF CANCER ARE GENOMIC INSTABILITY OF THE CANCERS WHICH MEANS THAT THEY HAVE
trainval/rufeSSlZJg8/50001 THE PROBLEM IS OF COURSE THERE AREN'T ENOUGH WOMEN IN NEWSROOMS
trainval/rufeSSlZJg8/50002 PUTTING THEM THERE MADE THEM MORE RECOGNIZABLE
trainval/rufeSSlZJg8/50003 A RECENT GLOBAL SURVEY FOUND THAT 73 PERCENT OF THE TOP MEDIA MANAGEMENT JOBS ARE STILL HELD BY MEN
trainval/rugSZIFY7mc/50001 I'M A MAMA'S BOY
trainval/rugSZIFY7mc/50002 I DON'T LIKE CHANGE
trainval/rugSZIFY7mc/50003 IF I WERE TO ASK ANYONE IN THIS ROOM WHEN YOU GOT THAT CAR THAT RAISE WHEN YOU BOUGHT THAT HOUSE WHEN YOU GOT THAT NEW
trainval/rugSZIFY7mc/50004 THEY NEVER TALK ABOUT MONEY
trainval/rugSZIFY7mc/50005 THEY ALWAYS TALK ABOUT A DAY WHEN SOMEONE MADE THEIR DAY BETTER
trainval/rugSZIFY7mc/50006 I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE THE WORLD
trainval/rugSZIFY7mc/50007 I'M JUST ASKING FOR A TINY BIT
trainval/rugSZIFY7mc/50008 I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
trainval/rugSZIFY7mc/50009 WE NEED PHYSICAL ACTION
trainval/rugSZIFY7mc/50010 I WANT SIMPLE LITTLE TINY THINGS
trainval/rugSZIFY7mc/50012 I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE TIME OF THE YEAR WHEN EVERYONE ELSE CARES
trainval/rugSZIFY7mc/50013 WE NEED THINGS TO BE BETTER
trainval/rugSZIFY7mc/50014 THAT'S THAT INTIMATE MOMENT BETWEEN TWO STRANGERS
trainval/rugSZIFY7mc/50015 I'M NOT TRYING TO SELL YOU INSURANCE
trainval/rugSZIFY7mc/50016 I DON'T HAVE AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE
trainval/rugSZIFY7mc/50017 IT'S A LEVEL PAYING FIELD
trainval/rugSZIFY7mc/50018 NO ONE IS FEELING LIKE A CHARITY CASE
trainval/rugSZIFY7mc/50019 THAT'S THE REASON 1
trainval/rugSZIFY7mc/50020 7 MILLION OF THESE HAVE MADE THEIR WAY TO A 123 COUNTRIES WITH NO MARKETING NO ADVERTISING
trainval/rugSZIFY7mc/50021 AND IT WON'T BE IN A HISTORY BOOK IT WILL BE AN IPAD 17 OR SOME TYPE OF A HOLOGRAPHIC PAGE THAT YOUR KID'S KIDS WILL TALK ABOUT
trainval/rugSZIFY7mc/50022 I DIDN'T ASK YOU FOR ANYTHING MUCH
trainval/rugSZIFY7mc/50023 PASS ON THE BRACELET
trainval/ruh6rN5UrME/50001 I WORKED EVERY WEEKEND
trainval/ruh6rN5UrME/50002 I WAS THAT GUY WHO IF I EVER SAID YES TO BEING INVITED OUT TO SOME SOCIAL FUNCTION WAS IN THE CORNER ON HIS
trainval/ruh6rN5UrME/50003 I BELIEVE WE CAN FUNDAMENTALLY REVERSE TRENDS IN LONELINESS AND AS A RESULT OF THAT CHANGE
trainval/RuVdkNdeVAc/50001 SO THAT INFORMATION COULD TELL ME IF THAT SHAMPOO IS GOOD FOR MY CURLY HAIR
trainval/RuVdkNdeVAc/50002 SO IT MEANS THAT THE MOMENT WE DECIDE TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION WE'RE ABLE TO GET REALLY
trainval/RuVdkNdeVAc/50003 SO FOR EXAMPLE WE ALREADY HAVE WATCHES WRISTBANDS CARS
trainval/ruvWiXowiZ8/50001 THE SECOND HALF WAS JUST ONE BIG NAP PRETTY MUCH IN CLASS
trainval/Rv9SwZWVkOs/50001 THEY OFFERED ME A SEAT NEXT TO THEM
trainval/Rv9SwZWVkOs/50002 I COULD BE FREE FROM MY DEPRESSION
trainval/RvpXNXXP5Vc/50001 HOW IS OUR CLIMATE CHANGING
trainval/RvpXNXXP5Vc/50002 IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE THE WAY IT WORKS
trainval/RvpXNXXP5Vc/50003 CLIMATE CHANGE HAPPENS
trainval/RVX8ZSAR4OY/50001 IS IT WHAT YOU WANT IT TO
trainval/RVX8ZSAR4OY/50002 IT MIGHT BE SILLY
trainval/RVX8ZSAR4OY/50004 YOU'RE CREATING SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL AND COMPLEX LIKE THIS DALE CHIHULY GLASS SCULPTURE
trainval/RVX8ZSAR4OY/50005 BUT INTERESTING AND COMPLEX AND A BRILLIANT PRESENTATION OF YOU THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU THINK
trainval/RVX8ZSAR4OY/50006 SO IF SOMEONE LOOKS AT THAT YOU'D THINK BRILLIANT
trainval/RVX8ZSAR4OY/50007 I RECOGNIZE THAT PERSON AS MYSELF
trainval/RVX8ZSAR4OY/50008 AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO PORTRAY TO PEOPLE
trainval/RVX8ZSAR4OY/50009 SO YOU CAN PRESENT YOURSELF IN SORT OF ON STAGE WAYS AND OFF STAGE WAYS
trainval/RVX8ZSAR4OY/50010 THIS IS MY CAT GODFREY
trainval/RVX8ZSAR4OY/50011 YOUR PARENTS MIGHT BE ON FACEBOOK
trainval/RVX8ZSAR4OY/50012 SOME OF THOSE THINGS ARE REALLY VISIBLE AND SOME OF THEM ARE REALLY INVISIBLE
trainval/RVX8ZSAR4OY/50013 AND FIVE PERCENT OF THEM HAVE FOUND SOMETHING ONLINE THEY DID NOT WANT TO SEE
trainval/RVX8ZSAR4OY/50014 AND THAT'S KIND OF INTERESTING
trainval/RVX8ZSAR4OY/50015 I TOTALLY LOVE THESE THINGS
trainval/RVX8ZSAR4OY/50016 THEY ARE CREATIVE FANTASTIC TOOLS
trainval/RVX8ZSAR4OY/50017 THEY ARE LIKE A BIG GIANT YARN SHOP FOR ANONYMITY
trainval/RVX8ZSAR4OY/50018 IT CAN BE REALLY FANTASTIC TO BUILD UP YOUR NETWORK
trainval/RVX8ZSAR4OY/50019 SOME OF THAT I'M PLEASED ABOUT ARE SOME OF THIS I REALLY MISSED
trainval/RVX8ZSAR4OY/50020 IS THAT HISTORY OF YOU
trainval/RVX8ZSAR4OY/50021 WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT YOU
trainval/rWhLSORCwW0/50001 AND THE ANSWER IS RATHER STRANGE
trainval/rWhLSORCwW0/50002 IT'S A LETTER
trainval/rWhLSORCwW0/50003 NOW I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A FOUR PARAGRAPH FORMAT TO WORK WITH
trainval/rWhLSORCwW0/50004 WHEN ANIMALS ARE GOING TO MAKE A POINT THEY MAKE THE POINT
trainval/rxeLnx5UEEk/50001 AND I WAS RACKING MY BRAINS AND FORTUNATELY SOMEONE HERE IN THE AUDIENCE SAVED ME BECAUSE I WAS LOOKING AT THE BOARDS THAT ARE
trainval/rxeLnx5UEEk/50002 AND I WOULD LOVE NOW TO START A CONVERSATION WHERE WE COULD TALK ABOUT OUR FAVORITE STORIES AND EXCHANGE THE REASONS
trainval/rXepkIWPhFQ/50001 AND I THINK I'VE WORKED OUT WHY
trainval/rXepkIWPhFQ/50002 THAT REALLY STUCK WITH ME
trainval/RxmzCJug9HE/50001 AND IT TURNS OUT PEOPLE DID NOT LIKE GOING TO THOSE OPEN SPACES
trainval/RxqyO5hafdk/50001 AFTER THAT WE PUT POISONS INTO OUR BODIES TO TRY TO KILL THE RAPIDLY DIVIDING CELLS
trainval/RxqyO5hafdk/50002 WE WOULD REPLACE THE VERY CELLS THAT ARE LOST IN BLINDNESS THAT IS THE PHOTORECEPTOR
trainval/RxqyO5hafdk/50003 IF WE WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO OVERCOME BLINDNESS WE NEEDED TO FIND A WAY
trainval/RxqyO5hafdk/50004 WE HAD INVENTED A NEW BIOMATERIAL A WATER SWOLLEN MATERIAL CALLED HYDROGEL
trainval/RxqyO5hafdk/50005 WHEN WE MIXED PHOTORECEPTOR CELLS INTO OUR INJECTABLE HYDROGEL AND
trainval/RxqyO5hafdk/50006 THEN SAM WEISS AND BRENT REYNOLDS DISCOVERED THAT WE ALL HAVE STEM CELLS IN OUR
trainval/RxqyO5hafdk/50007 USUALLY THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER IS FANTASTIC BECAUSE IT PROTECTS OUR BRAINS FROM EVERYDAY
trainval/RxqyO5hafdk/50008 I THINK PERHAPS AS AN ENGINEER WE ARE NOT BURDENED BY SOME OF THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM OR DOGMA
trainval/RxyQNEVOElU/50001 SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT A GEOLOGIST CAN'T TELL YOU WHETHER A VACCINE IS SAFE
trainval/RxyQNEVOElU/50002 THIS WAS A HUGE CONFIRMATION OF THE THEORY
trainval/RxyQNEVOElU/50003 SO NOMOLOGICAL MEANS HAVING TO DO WITH LAWS
trainval/RxyQNEVOElU/50004 WHY SHOULD BE BELIEVE THE SCIENCE
trainval/RxyQNEVOElU/50005 WELL IN HINDSIGHT WE CAN SAY THAT ASTRONOMERS WERE MAKING TWO AUXILIARY HYPOTHESES BOTH OF WHICH WE WOULD NOW
trainval/RxyQNEVOElU/50006 AND HE COLLECTED MANY THINGS INCLUDING HIS FAMOUS FINCHES
trainval/RxyQNEVOElU/50007 HOW CAN WE KNOW WHAT'S CAUSING THE OBSERVED WARMING
trainval/RxyQNEVOElU/50009 WE CAN ALSO THINK OF SCIENCE AS BEING A KIND OF A JURY EXCEPT IT'S A VERY SPECIAL KIND OF JURY
trainval/RxyQNEVOElU/50010 MOST OF US TRUST OUR CARS
trainval/RxyQNEVOElU/50011 SO WHY IS THAT
trainval/RxyQNEVOElU/50012 WHY DO CARS WORK SO WELL
trainval/RxyQNEVOElU/50013 IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF THE GENIUS OF HENRY FORD OR KARL BENZ OR EVEN ELON MUSK
trainval/rYwTA5RA9eU/50001 YOU KNOW FROM HEALTHCARE TO TRANSPORTATION EVERYTHING IS DIFFERENT BUT EDUCATION HASN'T CHANGED
trainval/rYwTA5RA9eU/50002 WE REALLY HAVE TO COMPLETELY REIMAGINE IT
trainval/rYwTA5RA9eU/50003 EVEN THE INFRASTRUCTURE HAS TO CHANGE
trainval/rYwTA5RA9eU/50004 EVERYTHING HAS TO CHANGE
trainval/rYwTA5RA9eU/50005 SO WHY ARE WE FIGHTING IT IN THE CLASSROOM
trainval/rYwTA5RA9eU/50006 LET'S NOT FIGHT IT
trainval/rYwTA5RA9eU/50007 LET'S EMBRACE IT
trainval/rYwTA5RA9eU/50008 IN FACT I BELIEVE AND I HAVE TWO FAT THUMBS I CAN'T TEXT VERY WELL BUT I'M WILLING TO BET THAT WITH EVOLUTION
trainval/rYwTA5RA9eU/50011 AND THE RESULTS WERE STAGGERING
trainval/rYwTA5RA9eU/50012 I MEAN HOW ELSE DO YOU TEACH 150000 STUDENTS
trainval/rYwTA5RA9eU/50013 YOUR COMPUTER IS GRADING ALL THE EXERCISES
trainval/rYwTA5RA9eU/50014 AND WE'VE ALL SUBMITTED HOMEWORKS AND YOUR GRADES COME BACK TWO WEEKS LATER YOU'VE FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT IT
trainval/rYwTA5RA9eU/50016 IN THE MORNING THEY HAD DISCOVERED THE RIGHT ANSWER
trainval/rYwTA5RA9eU/50017 THE AAKASH IS 40 DOLLARS
trainval/rYwTA5RA9eU/50018 WE HAVE TO MOVE FROM BRICKS AND MORTAR SCHOOL BUILDINGS TO DIGITAL DORMITORIES
trainval/Rz8m1yDE0ms/50001 I MUST HAVE SEEN THOUSANDS OF IDEAS OVER THE YEARS AND I'VE DONE MY BEST TO HELP WHEREVER I CAN
trainval/Rz8m1yDE0ms/50002 THEN 18 MONTHS AGO I GOT CHATTING TO ONE OF THE CHANGE MAKERS WITHIN THE NETWORK CALLED TRISTRAM
trainval/Rz8m1yDE0ms/50003 HE'S PIONEERED THE FIGHT AGAINST FOOD WASTE
trainval/Rz8m1yDE0ms/50004 AND QUITE RIGHT TOO
trainval/Rz8m1yDE0ms/50005 ONE THIRD OF THE FOOD THAT WE PRODUCE IN THE WORLD IS GOING TO WASTE
trainval/Rz8m1yDE0ms/50006 WHAT IF WE COULD GET WASTED ON WASTE
trainval/Rz8m1yDE0ms/50007 WE WANT TO BREW AS MUCH OF THAT BREAD THAT WOULD OTHERWISE GO TO WASTE AS POSSIBLE
trainval/Rz8m1yDE0ms/50008 WE SOURCE OUR BREAD FROM SANDWICH MANUFACTURERS WHERE THE HEEL OF A LOAF OF BREAD THE CRUST OF A LOAF
trainval/Rz8m1yDE0ms/50009 THE FINAL THING THAT WE DO
trainval/Rz8m1yDE0ms/50010 TRISTRAM FOUNDED FEEDBACK AND FEEDBACK HAS CHANGED GOVERNMENT POLICY THEY'VE LAUNCHED
trainval/Rz8m1yDE0ms/50011 BUT WE'RE NOT DONE YET
trainval/Rz8m1yDE0ms/50012 WE'VE COLLABORATED WITH BREWERIES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY TO CREATE NEW BREAD BEERS AND TACKLE BREAD WASTE AT A
trainval/Rz8m1yDE0ms/50013 THE DAY THAT THERE'S NO MORE WASTE BREAD TO BE BREWED IS THE DAY THAT WE CAN SHUT UP SHOP AND
trainval/Rz8m1yDE0ms/50014 FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS I'VE BEEN THE UK COUNTRY DIRECTOR FOR AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION CALLED
trainval/rzbtSeVZeEE/50001 THIS WASN'T ROCKET SCIENCE
trainval/rzbtSeVZeEE/50002 SOMETIMES THEIR PARENTS WOULD REJECT THEM SIBLINGS THEIR OWN CHILDREN AND THEN THEIR
trainval/rzbtSeVZeEE/50003 IT WAS SO AWFUL BUT WHY DID THEY DO IT AT 40 AND 50
trainval/rzbtSeVZeEE/50004 75 PERCENT OF THEM CAME FROM WITHIN 150 MILES
trainval/rzwJXUieD0U/50001 CERTAINLY WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING IS TRYING TO SAY
trainval/rzwJXUieD0U/50002 TEACHERS WHO WORK TOGETHER COLLECTIVELY COLLABORATIVELY TO UNDERSTAND THEIR IMPACT
trainval/rzwJXUieD0U/50004 AND YOU OUGHT TO REINVEST AND REINVEST
trainval/S0hxl03JoA0/50001 OR YOU MAY HAVE REALISED ALREADY OF COURSE THAT THESE BOTH MAY BE SELF EVIDENT TRUTHS BUT THEY CAN'T
trainval/S0hxl03JoA0/50002 ALL OF THESE ARE VARIATIONS ON THE EXPERIENCE OF LONELINESS
trainval/S0hxl03JoA0/50003 NOT LONG AGO WE THOUGHT ABOUT THE GENES AS THE KEYBOARD ON WHICH LIFE'S SONG PLAYED OUT
trainval/S0hxl03JoA0/50004 BE AWARE OF THOSE UNDERSTAND THOSE EFFECTS AND TAKE RESPONSABILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS TOWARD OTHERS
trainval/S0hxl03JoA0/50005 WHEN WE ARE HUNGRY WE CAN GO TO THE REFRIGERATOR AND GET A SNACK
trainval/S1VpOweDio8/50001 IMPUNITY WAS BROKEN
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50001 NOW I'M SURE ALL OF US HAVE EXPERIENCED THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU'RE WALKING ALONG IN A SHOPPING CENTER IMMERSED
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50002 AND THAT IS IMPORTANT
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50003 WE ARE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THINGS THAT ARE MORE FAMILIAR TO US EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY NOT BE
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50004 SO THIS IS JUST PART OF A MORE COMPLEX ISSUE
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50005 MORE SPECIFICALLY HOW WE SEE OURSELVES IN OUR MINDS OUR PERSONAL IDENTITIES ARE ONLY EVER PARTIALLY
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50006 AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IDENTITY CONFERS POWER ACCESS AND
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50007 ON A PRACTICAL LEVEL IN THE UNITED STATES IDENTITY THEFT DEPRIVES THE US ECONOMY OF
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50008 EXTROVERTED PERSONALITIES SUCH AS THE KARDASHIANS WHETHER YOU LOVE THEM OR HATE THEM HAVE MANAGED TO TURN THEIR
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50009 BECAUSE WE IDENTIFY WITH THEM AND PLACE OUR TRUST IN THEM
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50010 SO IT'S NO SURPRISE THEN THAT WE SPEND SO MUCH OF OUR TIME THINKING ABOUT WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE WOULD LIKE
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50011 AND YET REMARKABLY FEW OF US HAVE AN ACCURATE CONCEPTION OF OUR OWN IDENTITIES
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50012 WE MIGHT THINK THAT WE ARE BEING PERCEIVED IN A CERTAIN WAY OR BELIEVE THAT OUR ACTIONS ARE SHAPING THE VIEWS OF OTHERS
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50013 AND THIS IMPORTANTLY SUGGESTS THAT OUR IDENTITIES ARE NOT ENTIRELY WITHIN OUR CONTROL
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50014 ANOTHER WAY OF THINKING ABOUT THIS IS THE NUMBER OF AUTOMATIC ASSOCIATIONS WE MAKE WHEN WE MEET SOMEONE
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50015 HENCE WHY POLITICS ADVERTISING AND SOCIAL MEDIA ARE SUCH POWERFUL DRIVERS OF OUR THINKING
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50016 NOW WHEN I ASK MY FRIENDS WHAT DEFINES ME THEY OFTEN SAY THAT IT'S MY INTERMINABLE SARCASM OR MY
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50017 IT MAY SURPRISE YOU TO KNOW THAT IT IS THE FIFTH LARGEST RELIGION IN THE WORLD
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50018 ONE KEY PRACTICE OF THE FAITH IS NOT TO CUT YOUR HAIR
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50019 THERE ARE THREE MAIN REASONS FOR THIS
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50020 FIRST SIKHS BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE WERE CREATED AS THEY WERE MEANT TO BE AND THEREFORE BY NOT CUTTING OUR HAIR
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50021 BUT I QUICKLY CAUGHT UP AND BEFORE LONG HAD A FULL HEAD OF HAIR
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50022 NOW UNTIL I STARTED SCHOOL I NEVER REALIZED THAT THIS LENGTH OF HAIR WAS AT ALL UNUSUAL
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50023 AT SCHOOL I QUICKLY BECAME KNOWN AS THE GIRL WITH THE LONG HAIR A CATCHY MONIKER BUT NOT QUITE
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50025 THIS IS BECAUSE OUR REFLECTIONS ARE ONLY A MIRROR IMAGE OF OUR TRUE SELVES
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50026 THEY STARTED WHEN I WAS SIX AND HAVE NEVER REALLY STOPPED SINCE
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50027 HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO WASH
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50028 HAVE YOU EVER CUT IT
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50029 AND MY ALL TIME FAVORITE HAVE YOU EVER SAT ON IT
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50030 NOW SINCE I CAN SEE YOU'RE ALL WONDERING I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME ANSWERS
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50031 OUR TRUE SELVES ARE CAPTURED IN A PHOTOGRAPH
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50032 AND NOT ONE PERSON THROUGHOUT MY ENTIRE SCHOOLING EVER QUESTIONNED THE VALIDITY OF ME PERFORMING THESE
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50033 ONE INCIDENT THAT IS ETCHED FIRMLY INTO MY MEMORY HAPPENED WHEN I WAS AT A SCHOOL CAMP AGE TEN
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50034 IT CAME AS A SHOCK TO BE CALLED A FREAK BUT WHAT MADE IT PAINFUL WAS THAT I DIDN'T KNOW THIS GIRL IN FACT
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50035 THAT'S HOW WE ACTUALLY LOOK
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50036 AND YET AS RESEARCH HAS SHOWN MOST OF US PREFER LOOKING AT OUR MIRROR IMAGE
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50037 WE LIKE IT SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS MORE FAMILIAR TO US
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50038 ALL SHE KNEW ABOUT ME WAS THAT I HAD LONG HAIR
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50039 WITH ADOLESCENCE CAME THE ADDITIONAL PEER PRESSURE OF DRINKING ALCOHOL
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50040 NOW I'M AUSTRALIAN AND AUSTRALIANS LOVE TO DRINK
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50041 IN FACT IN AUSTRALIA DRINKING IS MORE POPULAR THAN SWIMMING AND PROBABLY MORE FUNDAMENTAL TO AUSTRALIAN
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50042 OR TELL THEM THAT YOU'VE ALREADY HAD ENOUGH TO DRINK
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50043 BUT BY THIS STAGE I WAS BEYOND PRETENDING
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50044 SO AS I FINISHED MY SCHOOL I BEGAN TO TELL PEOPLE I DON'T DRINK AND I DON'T CUT MY HAIR
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50045 OVER MY LIFE THERE HAVE BEEN MANY EXPERIENCES LIKE THIS WHICH HAVE MADE ME WANT TO CHOP IT ALL OFF
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50046 BUT ALSO DEMANDED TO BE TREATED AS AN EQUAL
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50047 IT'S ABOUT RECOGNIZING THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL IS COMPLEX AND CAPABLE OF THE ENTIRE BREADTH OF
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50048 I WANT MY QUIRKS AND MY INTRICACIES TO BE UNDERSTOOD AND FULLY APPRECIATED
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50049 I WANT TO BE SEEN AS A NUANCED YOUNG WOMAN WHOSE EXPERIENCES AND
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50050 AS A YOUNG GIRL I WOULD OFTEN STARE INTO THE MIRROR AND FANTASIZE ABOUT HAVING A SHORT SOPHISTICATED BOB
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50051 WELL AS I WALK AROUND OXFORD I SEE PEOPLE WITH TATTOOS CRAZY COLORED HAIR AND PUNK ROCK
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50052 EACH OF US IS COMING TO TERMS WITH OUR OWN DISTINCTIVENESS
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50053 I WOULD DREAM ABOUT JUST BEING A GIRL RATHER THAN THE GIRL WITH LONG HAIR
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50054 I WAS STANDING IN MY BATHROOM BRUSHING MY HAIR MY MOM WALKED IN AND JUST LOOKED AT ME AND SAID
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50055 YOU'VE NOW REACHED AN AGE WHERE YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS AND IF YOU WANT TO CUT IT YOU CAN
trainval/s2F41IQSPGE/50056 AS A TEENAGER I HAD BEGUN TO REALIZE THAT MY RELIGION MY IDENTITY AND THE PHYSICAL EXPRESSION OF THESE
trainval/S2HS8IfxzT4/50001 I'M ESSENTIALLY DROPPING A BASIC IDEA INTO A GROUP INTO A COMMUNITY PEOPLE START GRAVITATING TO
trainval/S2OzLREwHtI/50001 ALMOST ONE IN TWO
trainval/S2OzLREwHtI/50002 THANK YOU FOR THAT
trainval/S2OzLREwHtI/50003 BECAUSE FROM THE ANCIENT GREEKS ON IT WAS MOSTLY MEN WHO WROTE ABOUT IT
trainval/S2OzLREwHtI/50004 FAST FORWARD TO 1900 WE'RE IN THE U
trainval/S2OzLREwHtI/50005 THE AVERAGE LIFESPAN OF A U
trainval/S2OzLREwHtI/50006 I'D WRITTEN FOR MY EMPLOYER THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY ON A RANGE OF TOPICS WORK MONEY
trainval/S2OzLREwHtI/50007 IT'S BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME A WOMAN IS TELLING IT
trainval/S2OzLREwHtI/50009 THE WISDOM OF MENOPAUSE
trainval/S2OzLREwHtI/50010 SO THE OLD NARRATIVE ABOUT MENOPAUSE WAS THAT MENOPAUSE IS THE CHANGE RIGHT
trainval/S2OzLREwHtI/50011 AND THEN I REALIZED YOU KNOW TO TRULY CELEBRATE MENOPAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CHALLENGE AND
trainval/S2OzLREwHtI/50012 NARRATORS MAYBE WE DIDN'T ALWAYS COME UP WITH OURSELVES
trainval/S2OzLREwHtI/50013 ALMOST LIKE THEY WERE DISCOVERING SEX FOR THE FIRST TIME
trainval/S2OzLREwHtI/50014 UNLIKE MALES FEMALES CAN MAKE BABIES AND THEN STOP MAKING THEM BUT LIVE SEVERAL
trainval/S2OzLREwHtI/50015 FINALLY IN THESE WOMEN'S LIVES THEY HAD THEIR OWN MONEY THEIR OWN PLACES
trainval/S2OzLREwHtI/50016 IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE
trainval/S2OzLREwHtI/50017 BUT DON'T WORRY WORLD
trainval/S2SzP6NS9P0/50001 JUST ANOTHER BALD EAGLE
trainval/S2uSeHHzRto/50001 MY OPINION MATTERS
trainval/S2uSeHHzRto/50003 I WAS DENIED
trainval/S2uSeHHzRto/50004 I LATER FOUND OUT THAT NOBODY IN NEW YORK CITY HAD ACCESS TO THAT FORMULA
trainval/S2uSeHHzRto/50005 HE DECIDED TO PLOT THEM
trainval/S2uSeHHzRto/50006 THAT BEGS THE QUESTION WHAT IF THE ALGORITHMS ARE WRONG
trainval/S2uSeHHzRto/50007 THE DATA WHAT WOULD THE DATA BE
trainval/S2uSeHHzRto/50008 A REASONABLE CHOICE WOULD BE THE LAST 21 YEARS OF APPLICATIONS TO FOX NEWS
trainval/S2uSeHHzRto/50009 THEY AUTOMATE THE STATUS QUO
trainval/S2uSeHHzRto/50010 AND WE CAN FIX THEM
trainval/S2uSeHHzRto/50011 SECOND WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF SUCCESS AUDIT THAT
trainval/S2uSeHHzRto/50012 REMEMBER WITH THE HIRING ALGORITHM
trainval/S2uSeHHzRto/50013 WE TALKED ABOUT IT
trainval/S2uSeHHzRto/50014 SOMEONE WHO STAYS FOR FOUR YEARS AND IS PROMOTED ONCE
trainval/s32OdFz9ttk/50001 ON MARCH 17 2009 I WROTE AN EMAIL TO A FOURTH COUSIN ONCE REMOVED I
trainval/s32OdFz9ttk/50002 AND KEEP US LIVING LIVES THAT ARE SAFE AND TIDY
trainval/s32OdFz9ttk/50003 I HAVE AN AGENT SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY GOING REALLY REALLY WELL FOR ME
trainval/s32OdFz9ttk/50004 SHE AND JOHN RYDER HER HUSBAND ARE ACTUALLY THE ONLY TWO RYDERS THAT LIVE ON THE PROPERTY
trainval/s32OdFz9ttk/50005 THEY RUN THE ORGANIC FARMING OPERATION
trainval/s32OdFz9ttk/50006 SO I EMAILED HER AND SHE SAID I'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU COME ON UP
trainval/s32OdFz9ttk/50007 HERE'S WHAT DIDN'T HAPPEN
trainval/s32OdFz9ttk/50008 I'D HATCHED A PLAN
trainval/s32OdFz9ttk/50010 FOR ME THERE WASN'T A LIGHTBULB MOMENT
trainval/s32OdFz9ttk/50011 WORD GOT OUT ABOUT SPACE
trainval/s32OdFz9ttk/50012 AND IN CASE THERE IS ANY SORT OF QUESTION I'M VERY WELL AWARE THAT NOT EVERYONE HAS A LONG
trainval/s32OdFz9ttk/50013 IT IS WORK AND IT'S WORK I LOVE
trainval/s32OdFz9ttk/50014 AND I DIDN'T MISS IT
trainval/s3IPatkuByA/50001 BEING FAT TO ME NOW IT'S JUST A WORD IT'S JUST ONE OF THE MANY DESCRIPTORS
trainval/s3IPatkuByA/50002 HAVING SAID THAT HOW DO YOU HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP OR EVEN JUST A BETTER RELATIONSHIP IF YOU
trainval/s3IPatkuByA/50003 MY TRANSITION STARTS IN 2008 WHEN I STARTED BLOGGING ABOUT PLUS
trainval/s3IPatkuByA/50004 AND TELLS EACH OTHER THEY'RE GREAT
trainval/S3SnIMZ43EQ/50001 I'VE MADE MANY OTHER MISTAKES
trainval/S3SnIMZ43EQ/50002 THE FILM WAS DESIGNED TO COMBAT THE MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS OF THE RAUNCHING AND HUNTING
trainval/S3SnIMZ43EQ/50003 I GAVE MANY TALKS ABOUT IT AND AT ONE OF THESE TALKS SOMEBODY IN THE AUDIENCE PUT THEIR HAND UP AND SAID HOW
trainval/S3SnIMZ43EQ/50004 I TOLD HIM THE DEN WAS ARTIFICIAL THAT WE MADE IT
trainval/S3SnIMZ43EQ/50005 I TOLD THEM THE WOLVES WERE RENTED
trainval/S3SnIMZ43EQ/50006 BUT THEIR REAL CALLING SHOULD BE MORE THAN THAT
trainval/S47ZRF02Cyo/50001 I WILL SHOW YOU WHY THAT PHILOSOPHICALLY IS ALMOST AN IMPOSSIBILITY
trainval/S47ZRF02Cyo/50002 BUT LET ME FIRST ELABORATE JUST A LITTLE BIT ON A BASIC PRINCIPLE BEHIND EACH SEARCH QUERY THAT WE SOMETIMES SEEM TO
trainval/S47ZRF02Cyo/50003 SO WHENEVER YOU SET OUT TO GOOGLE SOMETHING START BY ASKING YOURSELF THIS
trainval/S47ZRF02Cyo/50004 AM I LOOKING FOR AN ISOLATED FACT
trainval/S47ZRF02Cyo/50005 WHAT IS THE CAPITAL OF FRANCE
trainval/S47ZRF02Cyo/50006 GREAT GOOGLE AWAY
trainval/S47ZRF02Cyo/50007 YOU DON'T SEE A BIG CONSPIRACY AMONG THOSE THINGS
trainval/S47ZRF02Cyo/50008 WE AGREE ON A GLOBAL SCALE WHAT THE ANSWERS ARE TO THESE ISOLATED FACTS
trainval/S47ZRF02Cyo/50009 AND I WILL SAY YES THIS IS TRUE BUT THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT TO ME THAN THAT
trainval/S47ZRF02Cyo/50010 THIS IS WHEN WE START TO ARGUE TO FORM SOCIETY
trainval/S47ZRF02Cyo/50011 STRANGELY ENOUGH I ALWAYS GET THE SAME THREE ANSWERS
trainval/S47ZRF02Cyo/50012 THERE WAS A PICTURE DISTRIBUTED WIDELY OVER THE INTERNET WHERE HER FACE WAS DISTORTED TO LOOK LIKE A MONKEY
trainval/S47ZRF02Cyo/50013 AND IT WORKED TOO
trainval/S47ZRF02Cyo/50014 AND HE PREPARED ALL THREE STEPS EQUALLY WELL
trainval/S47ZRF02Cyo/50015 AND IF THERE WAS SOMEBODY WHO IMMEDIATELY UNDERSTOOD THIS IT WAS A SWEDISH WEB DEVELOPER A SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION EXPERT
trainval/S47ZRF02Cyo/50017 THE HUMANITIES AND THE TECHNOLOGY
trainval/S47ZRF02Cyo/50018 AND IF NOTHING ELSE TO REMIND US THAT THAT WONDERFULLY SEDUCTIVE IDEA OF THE UNBIASED CLEAN SEARCH RESULT
trainval/S47ZRF02Cyo/50019 WE BELIEVE IN YOU WE DON'T BELIEVE IN YOU
trainval/S47ZRF02Cyo/50020 YOU'RE RIGHT YOU'RE WRONG
trainval/S47ZRF02Cyo/50021 AND MY MESSAGE GOES OUT NOT ONLY TO GOOGLE BUT TO ALL BELIEVERS IN THE FAITH OF CODE AROUND THE WORLD
trainval/S4rBC2lRmY0/50001 I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE INTERESTING EVEN FOR THE MANY LONG TIME COLLECTORS HERE WITH US AT TED LOCAL COLLECTORS
trainval/S4rBC2lRmY0/50002 BUT I CAN ONLY HOPE I'VE WHET YOUR APPETITE TO GO OUT AND SEE AND LEARN MORE ABOUT THE AMAZING THINGS THAT ARE
trainval/S4XXhSwYASk/50001 IT'S EXTRAORDINARY NOW HOW MUCH REHEARSING WE DO
trainval/S4XXhSwYASk/50002 THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE THEY REALLY DID THINK SHE WAS MAGIC HOW SHE ACHIEVED THIS
trainval/S4XXhSwYASk/50003 THIS WAS JUST BECAUSE HER FEET WERE INCREDIBLY STRONG
trainval/S6BLFdBfgfU/50001 BUT THERE IS A CATCH
trainval/S6BLFdBfgfU/50003 WE'VE BEEN TRYING FOR 50 YEARS
trainval/S6BLFdBfgfU/50004 IT'S A MEDIUM SIZED NUCLEUS
trainval/S6BLFdBfgfU/50005 AND YOU WANT TO GO TOWARDS IRON IF YOU WANT TO GET ENERGY
trainval/S6BLFdBfgfU/50006 SO URANIUM WHICH IS VERY BIG WANTS TO SPLIT
trainval/S6BLFdBfgfU/50007 AND YOU CAN GET ENERGY OUT THIS WAY
trainval/S6BLFdBfgfU/50008 YOU GET THEM CLOSER AND CLOSER AND CLOSER AND THEN AT SOME POINT THE STRONG FORCE GRIPS THEM TOGETHER
trainval/S6BLFdBfgfU/50009 AND IT'S THIS REACTION THAT WE WANT TO DO
trainval/S6BLFdBfgfU/50010 IT'S PRETTY HOT
trainval/S6BLFdBfgfU/50011 THIS IS A BIT SHOCKING BECAUSE IN FACT OUR GOVERNMENT IS RELYING ON THAT FOR US TO MEET KYOTO AND DO ALL THOSE KIND OF
trainval/S6BLFdBfgfU/50012 BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY FUSION POWER
trainval/S6BLFdBfgfU/50013 BUT THAT'S NOT ELECTRICITY YET
trainval/S6BLFdBfgfU/50014 WE REALLY NEED IT NOW
trainval/S6BLFdBfgfU/50015 I WISH WE HAD MORE MONEY I WISH WE HAD MORE RESOURCES
trainval/S6cX2p5cBVg/50001 IN FOOD CHAINS THE LOVELIEST SPECIES ARE THE SINGLE CELLED PLANTS AND THEIR TINY PREDATORS
trainval/S6pLPVfKFoQ/50001 THEY WOULD NOT BE BROKEN BY THEM
trainval/S6pLPVfKFoQ/50002 REMEMBER THAT EXTREMISM THRIVES ON THE FRINGES OF SOCIETY
trainval/S6pLPVfKFoQ/50003 WHEN WE DIVIDE PEOPLE INTO SMALLER AND SMALLER GROUPS BASED ON ONE ARBITRARY DISTINCTION OR
trainval/S6pLPVfKFoQ/50004 AND IT WOULDN'T BE AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT 99
trainval/S6pLPVfKFoQ/50005 WHEN WE OSTRACIZE THE INNOCENT IT TEARS APART THE FABRIC OF OUR SOCIETY WHICH ONLY WORKS TO FORMAT THE NEXT
trainval/S6pLPVfKFoQ/50006 I AM NOT MY FATHER
trainval/s6rJLXq1Re0/50001 AND EVERYONE DOES
trainval/s6rJLXq1Re0/50002 IT'S OUR FREE WILL IT'S HOW I LOOK
trainval/S74wSYuesOI/50001 THEY ACTUALLY HAD ALREADY BEEN TOLD THAT THEY COULD TAKE THE 250 WHICH THEY HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO TAKE WITH THEM FROM
trainval/S74wSYuesOI/50002 AND SHE SAID THE FOLLOWING
trainval/S74wSYuesOI/50003 AND I SWEAR THE FIRST THING WE'LL DO WHEN WE GO TO AMERICA IS WE'LL START TO WORK AND WE'LL PAY
trainval/S74wSYuesOI/50004 YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID
trainval/S74wSYuesOI/50005 IT WORKED BECAUSE OF A POWERFUL NARRATIVE WE CAN NAME IT THE AMERICAN DREAM
trainval/S74wSYuesOI/50006 IT ALSO WORKED BECAUSE OF THE POWER OF NARRATIVE
trainval/S74wSYuesOI/50007 THOSE STORIES THAT ARE SO BIG THAT WE LIVE INSIDE THEM
trainval/S74wSYuesOI/50008 THEY TELL US WHO WE ARE THE MEANING OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AROUND US WHERE WE CAME FROM AND THEY GIVE US SOME GUIDANCE
trainval/S74wSYuesOI/50009 I MEAN REALLY HOW DID MY GRANDMOTHER WHO GREW UP IN A VILLAGE IN A COUNTRY THAT WOULD BECOME TURKEY KNOW OF
trainval/S74wSYuesOI/50010 THERE ARE LOTS OF STORIES LOTS OF WAYS OF THINKING LOTS OF CODES LOTS OF SYMBOLS AND THEY'RE ALL
trainval/S74wSYuesOI/50011 WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN THE EUROPEAN UNION WHICH WAS A SHARED DREAM CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO
trainval/S74wSYuesOI/50012 WHAT SHOULD WE DO WHEN THAT PLACE THAT WE CALL THE WEST AND THAT PLACE THAT WE CALL ISLAM CAN'T
trainval/S74wSYuesOI/50013 SO WE NEED A NEW STORY
trainval/S74wSYuesOI/50014 BUT THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY DEMOCRATICALLY PERFECT EXAMPLES OF CROWDSOURCING EITHER
trainval/S74wSYuesOI/50015 THEY SUPPRESS SOME VOICES AND THEY ELEVATE OTHERS
trainval/S74wSYuesOI/50016 AND THAT IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE NOT ONLY RESPONSIBLE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP BUT ONE THAT UNDERSTANDS
trainval/S74wSYuesOI/50017 MY GRANDMOTHER WAS NOT MY GRANDFATHER'S FIRST CHOICE IN MARRIAGE
trainval/S74wSYuesOI/50018 THE SAME THING THREE THINGS THAT ALL SUCCESSFUL SOCIETAL NARRATIVES HAVE
trainval/S74wSYuesOI/50019 AND WE DON'T REALLY BUY STORIES ANYMORE IN WHICH WE ARE TOLD THE END AND WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SORT OF LEAVE OUT
trainval/S74wSYuesOI/50020 THE OTHER REASON WE NEED STORIES THAT OFFER US A CHOICE IS BECAUSE WHEN WE HAVE HARD PROBLEMS OR
trainval/s7R5Ty1XfqE/50001 BUT OH HOW THEY CRAVED THEM
trainval/S7SXH1CBzGw/50001 SO THIS IS A FIRST INDICATION THAT THE ALL BRAINS ARE MADE THE SAME WAY SCENARIO IS NOT QUITE RIGHT
trainval/S7SXH1CBzGw/50002 BUT LET'S PLAY ALONG
trainval/S7SXH1CBzGw/50003 AND HERE COMES THE BAD NEWS OUR BRAIN NOT THE LARGEST ONE AROUND
trainval/S7SXH1CBzGw/50004 MAYBE THE PROBLEM WAS WITH THE BASIC ASSUMPTION THAT ALL BRAINS ARE MADE IN THE SAME WAY
trainval/S7SXH1CBzGw/50005 MAYBE THE HUMAN BRAIN ACTUALLY HAS THE MOST NEURONS OF ANY BRAIN REGARDLESS OF ITS SIZE
trainval/S7SXH1CBzGw/50006 NO OTHER ANIMAL COOKS ITS FOOD
trainval/S7SXH1CBzGw/50007 ONLY HUMANS DO
trainval/s7YsNStlRwI/50002 AS A NATION IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO US
trainval/s7YsNStlRwI/50003 THERE ARE MANY OTHER PROJECTS
trainval/s7YsNStlRwI/50004 THE KEY TO SUCCESS IN THE WORLD ECONOMY THE UNITED STATES' SUCCESS IN THE WORLD ECONOMY IS INNOVATION
trainval/s7YsNStlRwI/50005 WE CAN MAKE A START
trainval/S8201wl4jjw/50001 AND OVER A HUNDRED APPLICATIONS CAME IN
trainval/S8bJ3YlgL1Q/50001 MY NAME IS SARAH AND EVERYTHING PERTAINING TO THAT JOKE RELATES TO ME
trainval/S8bJ3YlgL1Q/50002 I REALLY DO HAVE A 4
trainval/S8bJ3YlgL1Q/50003 B REPLIES WE'RE ONLY ON THE SECOND FLOOR
trainval/S8DwxjDrNNM/50001 AND I SWALLOWED THEIR INSULTS ALONG WITH THEIR SLURS
trainval/S8DwxjDrNNM/50002 CALLED ME BY A NAME I DID NOT RECOGNIZE SAID LESBIAN BUT I WAS MORE BOY THAN GIRL MORE KEN THAN
trainval/S8DwxjDrNNM/50003 IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HATING MY BODY I JUST LOVE IT ENOUGH TO LET IT GO I TREAT IT LIKE A HOUSE AND WHEN YOUR
trainval/S8DwxjDrNNM/50004 AND PEOPLE STILL WONDER WHY THERE ARE BOYS ROTTING THEY GO AWAY IN HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAYS THEY ARE AFRAID OF
trainval/S98m4Vod6S8/50001 AND MEASURING YOUR PROGRESS ON THAT JOURNEY USING VERB TABLES AND GRAMMAR EXAMS WHILST HELPFUL FOR
trainval/S98m4Vod6S8/50002 SO I BEGAN TO SET UP MY OWN MILESTONES FOR WHEN I KNEW THAT I WAS MAKING PROGRESS
trainval/S98m4Vod6S8/50003 AND IN MANY WAYS GERMAN IS QUITE A LOGICAL AND MATHEMATICAL LANGUAGE
trainval/S98m4Vod6S8/50004 I REMEMBER ASKING MY HOUSEMATES WHAT THE GERMAN WORD FOR A KETTLE WAS
trainval/S98m4Vod6S8/50005 AND THEY SAID DAS IST EIN WASSERKOCHER
trainval/S98m4Vod6S8/50006 SIMILARLY I FOUND OUT THE GERMAN WORD FOR NIPPLE IS BRUSTWARZE
trainval/S98m4Vod6S8/50008 AND SO WHILST GERMAN TAUGHT ME A LINK BETWEEN MATHS AND POETRY THAT I HADN'T PREVIOUSLY BEEN ABLE TO IMAGINE IT
trainval/S9gAgInOV8w/50001 WE DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW THE FUTURE WILL PLAN OUT DO WE
trainval/s9jsZPeqFCw/50001 FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE SEE DRAMA WE ROOT FOR THE PERSON THAT REALLY FIGHTS ALL THESE
trainval/s9jsZPeqFCw/50002 THIS IS WHAT DRAMA IS ALL ABOUT
trainval/s9jsZPeqFCw/50003 AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO QUALIFY THE PURPOSE
trainval/S9O9vyJBQ6g/50001 I BOUGHT INTO THIS DREAM MORE THAN ANYONE
trainval/S9PEogIrHSk/50001 AND SO WHAT I'VE JUST TOLD YOU IS THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE ANY DIRECTION IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE YOUR OWN
trainval/S9PEogIrHSk/50002 SO ONE OF THE GOALS I TOLD YOU ABOUT WAS GOING TO A TOP UNIVERSITY
trainval/S9PEogIrHSk/50003 SO WHAT DID I DO
trainval/S9PEogIrHSk/50004 OK TOMORROW'S THE ENTRANCE EXAM WE'LL HAVE TO GO AND WE'LL SIGN UP ON THE DAY
trainval/S9PEogIrHSk/50005 WE DECIDED FINE THAT'S ENOUGH
trainval/S9PEogIrHSk/50006 OH I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR ANY OF THAT MY TEACHERS DID THOUGH
trainval/S9PEogIrHSk/50007 THEY TOLD ME
trainval/S9PEogIrHSk/50008 YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET INTO MIT
trainval/S9PEogIrHSk/50009 BUT I WAS LIKE
trainval/S9PEogIrHSk/50010 WELL WHAT AM I GOING TO LOSE FROM FILLING OUT THIS APPLICATION
trainval/S9PEogIrHSk/50011 AT SCHOOL THEY OFFERED LATIN OR MATHS
trainval/S9PEogIrHSk/50012 IT WASN'T A PARTICULARLY COOL THING TO DO
trainval/S9PEogIrHSk/50013 SO I WAS IN THE LIFT CHIT CHATTING TO THE MAYOR OF FRANKFURT PETRA ROTH AT THE TIME
trainval/S9PEogIrHSk/50014 BUT I DID DECIDE THAT I WANT THE TOP MARK AT MY UPPER
trainval/S9PEogIrHSk/50015 SO EVEN THOUGH I DON'T HAVE TALENT YOU CAN GET PRETTY FAR
trainval/S9PEogIrHSk/50016 DON'T BE DAUNTED BY THE FACT THAT I'VE TOLD YOU TO CHOOSE THE DIRECTION NOW IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE YOUR
trainval/S9PEogIrHSk/50017 THE LAST INGREDIENT THAT YOU NEED FOR DECIDING WHERE YOU ARE GOING TO GO WHEN HAVING THAT IMPACT ARE YOUR OWN VALUES
trainval/S9PEogIrHSk/50018 BUT I'M ALSO TRYING TO SAVE MYSELF AND DO GOOD THINGS TO MYSELF
trainval/S9PEogIrHSk/50019 BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT SOCIETY DOESN'T WORK UNLESS EACH AND EVERYONE OF US ARE FEELING
trainval/S9ry1M7JlyE/50001 CAN YOU GET THOSE FOLK TALKING
trainval/S9ry1M7JlyE/50002 SO THINKING ABOUT THOSE THINGS TOGETHER FEELS RIGHT
trainval/S9ry1M7JlyE/50003 SO IT'S REASONABLE TO SAY THAT GRAND CROSSING IS ALREADY IN THE PROCESS OF BEING SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN IT
trainval/S9u71TB0VkA/50001 SO WHEN I WAS 15 I QUIT SCHOOL
trainval/S9u71TB0VkA/50002 I SERIOUSLY THOUGHT THAT I WOULD NOT LIVE TILL 20
trainval/S9ZciGIBcS8/50001 AND THIS IS WHERE I WAS
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50001 THESE ARE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE AT THE CENTER OF MY EXPLORATION ON THE NATURE OF EROTIC
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50002 ALL THESE ANCHORING GROUNDING EXPERIENCES OF OUR LIVES THAT WE CALL HOME
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50003 GIVE ME PREDICTABILITY GIVE ME SURPRISE
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50004 WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LOVE AND DESIRE
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50005 IN LOVE WE WANT TO HAVE WE WANT TO KNOW THE BELOVED
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50006 WE WANT TO MINIMIZE THE DISTANCE
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50007 WE WANT TO CONTRACT THAT GAP
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50008 WE WANT TO NEUTRALIZE THE TENSIONS
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50009 OR IN OTHER WORDS I SOMETIMES SAY FIRE NEEDS AIR
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50010 AND WHEN IT'S SAID LIKE THAT IT'S OFTEN QUITE ABSTRACT
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50011 BUT THEN I TOOK A QUESTION WITH ME
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50012 AND ACROSS CULTURE ACROSS RELIGION AND ACROSS GENDER EXCEPT FOR ONE THERE ARE A FEW ANSWERS
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50013 NOVELTY IS WHAT PARTS OF YOU DO YOU BRING OUT
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50014 SEX IS A PLACE YOU GO
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50015 IT'S A SPACE YOU ENTER INSIDE YOURSELF AND WITH ANOTHER OR OTHERS
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50016 SO WHERE DO YOU GO IN SEX
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50017 WHAT DO YOU SEEK TO EXPRESS THERE
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50018 IS IT A PLACE FOR NAUGHTINESS AND IS IT A PLACE TO BE SAFELY AGGRESSIVE
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50019 WE CAN HINT AT IT
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50020 WE CAN EXPERIENCE THAT POWERFUL THING CALLED ANTICIPATION WHICH IS A MORTAR TO DESIRE
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50021 SO WHEN I BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT EROTICISM I BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT THE POETICS OF SEX
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50022 BUT THE CENTRAL AGENT IS REALLY THAT PIECE CALLED THE IMAGINATION
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50023 BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR ME TO BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND WHO ARE THE COUPLES WHO HAVE AN EROTIC SPARK
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50024 AND PEOPLE BEGAN TO SAY I TURN MYSELF OFF WHEN I FEEL DEAD INSIDE WHEN I DON'T LIKE MY BODY
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50025 AND THEN I BEGAN TO ASK THE REVERSE QUESTION
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50026 NOW IF YOU ARE DEAD INSIDE THE OTHER PERSON CAN DO A LOT OF THINGS FOR VALENTINE'S
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50027 IT WON'T MAKE A DENT
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50028 AND IF YOU TELL THEM HEY KIDDO THE WORLD'S A GREAT PLACE
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50029 BUT IF ON THIS SIDE THERE IS SOMEBODY WHO SAYS I'M WORRIED
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50030 MY PARTNER HASN'T TAKEN CARE OF ME IN SO LONG
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50031 WHAT'S SO GOOD OUT THERE
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50032 DON'T WE HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED TOGETHER YOU AND I
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50033 THAT WILL BECOME BURDENED WITH EXTRA WORRY AND EXTRA RESPONSIBILITY AND
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50034 AND THOSE ARE OFTEN THE PEOPLE THAT WILL TELL YOU IN THE BEGINNING IT WAS SUPER HOT
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50035 THE MORE CONNECTED I BECAME THE MORE RESPONSIBLE I FELT THE LESS I WAS ABLE TO LET GO IN
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50036 ON THE ONE HAND YOU WANT THE SECURITY IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GO
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50037 THEY ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT FOREPLAY IS NOT SOMETHING YOU DO FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THE REAL THING
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50038 IT'S ABOUT YOU CREATE A SPACE WHERE YOU LEAVE MANAGEMENT INC
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50039 MAYBE WHERE YOU LEAVE THE AGILE PROGRAM {LG}
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50040 RESPONSIBILITY AND DESIRE JUST BUTT HEADS
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50041 THEY DON'T REALLY DO WELL TOGETHER
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50042 IT STARTS VERY YOUNG
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50043 BUT WHAT THEY KNOW IS THEY KNOW HOW TO RESURRECT IT
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50044 IT CONTINUES INTO OUR SEX LIVES UP TO THE END
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50045 ARE YOU GOING TO BE ANGRY WITH ME
trainval/sa0RUmGTCYY/50046 AND THEY MAY BE GONE BUT THEY'RE NEVER REALLY AWAY
trainval/sa1iS1MqUy4/50001 WE FOUND OURSELVES OUTNUMBERED DAY AFTER WRETCHED DAY
trainval/sa1iS1MqUy4/50002 WE USED TO STAY INSIDE FOR RECESS BECAUSE OUTSIDE WAS WORSE
trainval/sa1iS1MqUy4/50003 WHEN I WAS EIGHT I WANTED TO BE A MARINE BIOLOGIST
trainval/sa1iS1MqUy4/50004 WHEN I WAS NINE I SAW THE MOVIE JAWS AND THOUGHT TO MYSELF NO THANK YOU
trainval/sa1iS1MqUy4/50005 WHEN I WAS 11 I WANTED TO BE LEFT ALONE
trainval/sa1iS1MqUy4/50006 WHEN I WAS 12 I WANTED TO DIE
trainval/sa1iS1MqUy4/50007 I WAS GOING TO BE A WRESTLER
trainval/sa1iS1MqUy4/50008 I HAD IT ALL FIGURED OUT
trainval/sa1iS1MqUy4/50009 ONE OF THE FIRST LINES OF POETRY I CAN REMEMBER WRITING WAS IN RESPONSE TO A WORLD THAT DEMANDED I HATE MYSELF
trainval/sa1iS1MqUy4/50010 TURNS OUT IT'S NOT THAT HARD TO TRICK SOMEONE AND ONE DAY BEFORE CLASS I SAID YEAH YOU CAN COPY MY HOMEWORK
trainval/sa1iS1MqUy4/50011 I THOUGHT THEY WERE BOTH PORK CHOPS
trainval/sa1iS1MqUy4/50012 MY GRANDMOTHER THOUGHT IT WAS CUTE AND BECAUSE THEY WERE MY FAVORITE SHE LET ME KEEP DOING IT
trainval/sa1iS1MqUy4/50013 NOT REALLY A BIG DEAL
trainval/sa1iS1MqUy4/50014 ONE DAY BEFORE I REALIZED FAT KIDS ARE NOT DESIGNED TO CLIMB TREES I FELL OUT OF A TREE AND BRUISED THE RIGHT
trainval/sa1iS1MqUy4/50015 WE GREW UP LEARNING TO CHEER ON THE UNDERDOG BECAUSE WE SEE OURSELVES IN THEM
trainval/sAINrzTddA0/50001 WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHTS ON GETTING MY EYEBROWS TATTOOED
trainval/sAMahX5hIgU/50001 SO THINK ABOUT THAT
trainval/sAMahX5hIgU/50002 BUT IT TURNS OUT THE PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM IS A VERY POWERFUL TOOL IN BASEBALL
trainval/sAMahX5hIgU/50003 SO GOOD JOB
trainval/sAMahX5hIgU/50004 SO OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE THE MATH AND THE SCIENCE SO SIMPLE
trainval/sAMahX5hIgU/50006 WHAT WE DO IS WE SET UP AN EXPERIMENT FOR STUDENTS TO THINK ABOUT
trainval/sAMahX5hIgU/50007 LET'S SET UP AN EXPERIMENT
trainval/sAMahX5hIgU/50008 PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL FIELD
trainval/sAMahX5hIgU/50009 AND I LIVED IN BOSTON ACTUALLY DURING THE TIME WHEN THE CURSE OF THE BAMBINO WAS BROKEN
trainval/sAMahX5hIgU/50010 SO SO FAR WE TRAINED 200 TEACHERS IN ARIZONA
trainval/sAMahX5hIgU/50011 AND WE ARE GROWING THIS PROGRAM WORLDWIDE
trainval/sAMahX5hIgU/50012 WE WANT TO EMPOWER THESE TEACHERS TO REALLY BE THE DEPLOYMENT MECHANISM FOR THE PROGRAM
trainval/sAMahX5hIgU/50013 WE'VE SEEN THE NUMBER OF THE SCIENCE FAIR PROJECTS INCREASE IN TERMS OF THEIR APPLICATION TO SPORTS
trainval/sAMahX5hIgU/50014 WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH OUR SCIENCE IN BASEBALL PROGRAM IN ARIZONA CALIFORNIA ILLINOIS AND
trainval/SasMjDCSyR4/50001 WHEN I SPEND AN ENTIRE 12 HOUR SHIFT WITH A PATIENT WHO JUST A FEW DAYS
trainval/SasMjDCSyR4/50002 BUT FOR THIS PATIENT HIS FAMILY AND FOR ALL OF US WHEN WE FIND OURSELVES IN THIS KIND OF
trainval/SasMjDCSyR4/50003 MARION CONTI O'HARE IS A NURSE RESEARCHER WHO DEVELOPED THIS PERSPECTIVE INTO A THEORY KNOWN AS THE
trainval/SasMjDCSyR4/50004 AT SOME POINT EACH ONE OF US WILL BE PROFOUNDLY AFFECTED BY ILLNESS BE IT IN
trainval/SasMjDCSyR4/50005 I WAS WITH HIS FAMILY IN HIS FINAL MOMENTS BEFORE WE WITHDREW HIS LIFE SUPPORT
trainval/SasMjDCSyR4/50006 IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FUNCTION NORMALLY AT HOME AND IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO GO BACK TO WORK
trainval/SasMjDCSyR4/50007 BUT IT WAS ALSO THE MOMENT WHEN I LEARNED MY NEXT LIFE GIVING LESSON FROM MY
trainval/sAUIAChAmc4/50001 WE THEN HAVE TO START IF WE HAVE KIDS SAVING FOR THEIR COLLEGE FUND AND SO ON
trainval/sAUIAChAmc4/50002 PERHAPS TRAVELING WAS WHAT I WANTED TO DO NEXT SO I NEEDED TO SELL THE HOUSE
trainval/sAUIAChAmc4/50003 THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M GOING TO DO NEXT
trainval/sAUIAChAmc4/50004 I MADE A LIST OF 100 GOALS AND I NEEDED A TIMELINE IN WHICH TO ACHIEVE THOSE
trainval/saXfavo1OQo/50001 IT HAD GONE ON FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS
trainval/saXfavo1OQo/50002 IT WAS IMMENSELY COSTLY AND STRESSFUL NOT ONLY TO BOTH PARTIES BUT TO THEIR FAMILIES
trainval/saXfavo1OQo/50003 WHAT DO YOU MEAN PROGRESS
trainval/saXfavo1OQo/50004 LAST YEAR ALL THE FESTIVITIES WERE CANCELED BECAUSE OF THE CONFLICT
trainval/saXfavo1OQo/50005 I ASKED HIM
trainval/saXfavo1OQo/50006 EVERYBODY WOULD BE MUCH BETTER OFF
trainval/Sb2qXygFm8U/50001 LIFE HAS BEEN REALLY TOUGH FOR A LOT OF FARM FAMILIES
trainval/Sb2qXygFm8U/50002 AND OPPORTUNITY OUTSIDE OF THE FARM HAS ONLY GROWN
trainval/Sb2qXygFm8U/50003 BUT NONE OF THEM FARMED
trainval/Sb2qXygFm8U/50004 AND GUESS WHAT
trainval/Sb2qXygFm8U/50005 WHEN MANY OF US IN THIS ROOM PROBABLY REALIZE THAT IN A LOT OF REGIONS 300000
trainval/Sb2qXygFm8U/50006 SO EVERY YEAR THEY ARE AT THE MERCY OF THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND FARMERS ARE LEFT TO
trainval/Sb2qXygFm8U/50007 THEN YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE OWNER OF THAT FARM AND YOU HAVE TO BEG THEM TO WADE WITH
trainval/Sb2qXygFm8U/50008 AND WE HAVE GOT TO HELP THEM DO THEIR JOBS AND SERVE THE NEXT GENERATION MORE EFFECTIVELY
trainval/Sb2qXygFm8U/50009 WHICH IS VERY FAR FROM A SUPER MAJORITY RIGHT
trainval/SB9A3J70IPQ/50001 BUT FILM AND VIDEO DOES FLATTEN SCULPTURE SO I TRIED TO IMAGINE A WAY THAT
trainval/sBaiRpIpPKQ/50001 SOMETHING WE DON'T HAVE AT HOME
trainval/sBaiRpIpPKQ/50002 AND DESTINATIONS WANT TO OFFER SOMETHING DIFFERENT
trainval/sBaiRpIpPKQ/50003 THAT'S THEIR UNIQUE SELLING PROPOSITION
trainval/sBaiRpIpPKQ/50004 BUT LET ME ASK THIS
trainval/sBaiRpIpPKQ/50005 BETTER FOR THE TRAVELER BETTER FOR THE DESTINATION BETTER FOR THE STAKEHOLDERS
trainval/sBaiRpIpPKQ/50006 YOU'RE GOING TO STOCKHOLM
trainval/sBaiRpIpPKQ/50007 IT'S NOT JUST THE AIRLINES AND THE HOTELS
trainval/sBaiRpIpPKQ/50008 OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WANT MORE TOURISTS AS WELL
trainval/sBaiRpIpPKQ/50009 THE FIRST STEP IN DOING THAT IS FIGURING OUT HOW MANY VISITORS YOUR DESTINATION CAN ACTUALLY HOLD
trainval/sBaiRpIpPKQ/50010 WHICH IS THE TRADITIONAL WAY OF DOING IT
trainval/sBaiRpIpPKQ/50011 YOU WANT TO THINK OF IT MORE LIKE THIS
trainval/sBaiRpIpPKQ/50012 AND IF TOURISM HOPES TO HAVE A LUCRATIVE FUTURE WE HAVE TO TREAT TOURISTS AND VISITORS WITH RESPECT
trainval/SbgwDk7A4as/50001 WE'RE VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO THAT
trainval/SbgwDk7A4as/50002 IF YOU GO DOWN YOUR HOUSE GOES DOWN
trainval/SbgwDk7A4as/50003 YOUR NEIGHBOR WOULD BE FINE EVERYONE AROUND YOU
trainval/SbphPa7Wp4c/50001 CAN YOU IMAGINE AN OBJECT LIKE THAT IN THE MACRO WORLD
trainval/sBsuIAscshE/50001 I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A CASE
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50001 A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO I WAS IN CHINA
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50002 WE'RE MICRO GRADING AREAS TO REMOVE THE DRAINAGE PROBLEM
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50003 AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO ALLOW THEM TO FEEL SAFE OR COMFORTABLE
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50004 AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF IT'S GREAT IN THIS MOMENT WHEN I RECOGNIZE THAT HE PUT VALUE IN
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50005 THE SPACE BETWEEN THINGS
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50006 AND PERHAPS MORE SO THAN ANY OTHER PROJECT OF OURS WHERE THIS HAS A SPECIAL MEANING IS OUR RECONSTRUCTION
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50007 SO I FOUND A LITTLE FRUIT STAND ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50008 WHEREAS IF YOU ASK SOMEONE FROM NEBRASKA THEY THINK IT'S THE MOST AMAZING THING ON EARTH
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50009 WHICH IS A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE TO HAVE
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50010 ONCE WE WENT OUT TO TIME SQUARE AND WE STOOD AT ONE END AND WE LOOKED ACROSS TIME SQUARE FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50012 AND THAT'S WHERE THE RAIN WATER PUDDLES ACTUALLY APPEAR
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50013 AND NOBODY REALLY NOTICED IT BECAUSE MOST EVERYONE THINKS OF IT AS IT IS FLAT
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50014 WE TRIED TO UNDERSTAND THAT BETTER
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50015 SO OVERVIEW OF THE SPACES ALONG BROADWAY HERE WITH 7TH AVENUE STILL HAVING TRAFFIC
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50016 WE'RE ACTUALLY INCREASING THE SPEED OF TRAFFIC BECAUSE WE'RE REMOVING TRAFFIC LIGHTS FROM TIME SQUARE
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50017 WHICH IS ALSO IMPORTANT
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50018 WE THEN THOUGHT TO OURSELVES HOW ARE WE GOING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50019 I ALWAYS LAUGHED WHENEVER I READ A TEMPLE GRANDIN BOOK
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50020 I THOUGHT TO MYSELF IF YOU REPLACED THE WORD COW WITH THE WORD HUMAN IT STILL MAKES PERFECT SENSE
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50022 WE CREATE LIVES FOR OURSELVES THAT ARE DOMESTIC
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50023 AND WE MOVE IN MANY WAYS LIKE LIVESTOCK
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50024 WE HATE TO ADMIT IT BECAUSE WE THINK WE'RE ABOVE ALL THAT
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50025 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS INTERESTING IS THAT HUMAN BEINGS ACTUALLY RESPOND IN A VERY POSITIVE
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50026 SO WHY IS IT THAT THOSE TWO PLACES ARE SO DIFFERENT
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50027 BECAUSE EVERYONE'S IN THE SAME BOAT
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50028 AND WE THOUGHT TO DO THAT AT TIME SQUARE
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50029 THERE'S A WONDERFUL THESE ARE DAYLIGHT SUNLIGHT STUDIES WE MADE OF TIME SQUARE
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50030 BUT WE WANTED TO REFLECT THAT LIGHT INTO THE GROUND
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50032 I THOUGHT IT WAS KIND OF FUN
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50033 THESE ARE SOLID GRANITE CURBS THAT WILL GO IN ON THE CORNERS OF THE STREETS
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50034 THEY'RE BEING LAID NOW AND IN A BEAUTIFUL WAY
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50035 IT'S A GREAT TEAM WORKING OUT THERE
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50036 THEY'RE WORKING THROUGH THE WINTER THROUGH THE COLD WEATHER TO MAKE SURE THAT IT HAPPENS QUICKLY
trainval/SC3DVeWT09w/50037 OF COURSE WE'RE SEEING ALL KINDS OF ODD THINGS
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50001 NOW LET ME TELL YOU THE REALITY
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50003 OVER A MILLION
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50004 THEY MIGHT HAVE MISSED A BUS MIGHT HAVE SOME CARING RESPONSIBILITIES MIGHT JUST BE A BIT LATE
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50005 THEY LOSE MONEY
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50006 THE SAME YEAR WE CONVICTED 220 TAX EVADERS
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50007 PIECING IT TOGETHER YOU UNDERSTAND THE INSECURITY THAT PEOPLE ARE FACING
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50008 A JOB FOR LIFE
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50009 I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50010 IF THERE ARE DOCTORS LAWYERS AND ACCOUNTANTS IN THE AUDIENCE YOU'RE NOT SAFE EITHER
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50011 THE INSECURITY IS LIKELY TO SPREAD
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50012 ADDS TO THE INSECURITY
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50013 WE SHOULD BE PUSHING BACK AGAINST THE INSECURITY
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50014 IT'S ABOUT WORK
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50015 IT'S ABOUT US AS PEOPLE
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50016 THE PLATFORM WE NEED IS SOMETHING CALLED UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50017 AT THE RSA WE'VE DONE THE SUMS
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50018 PEOPLE STAYED IN EDUCATION LONGER GOT MORE QUALIFICATIONS
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50019 THEIR WELL BEING WAS GREATER
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50020 ALASKA IS ONE OF THE MOST EQUAL U
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50021 IT'S WORKING IN ALASKA
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50022 IT WAS TRIED IN INDIA
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50025 IT'S BEEN TRIED IN KENYA IT'S BEEN TRIED IN NAMIBIA IT'S BEEN TRIED IN NORTH CAROLINA U
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50026 WE WANT TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50027 THE FINNISH GOVERNMENT HAS SAID WE WANT TO TRY A BASIC INCOME
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50028 THEY'RE GOING TO TRY IT NEXT YEAR AS WELL
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50029 FINLAND SWITZERLAND THE NETHERLANDS U
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50030 I WANT TO ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50031 WE SHOULD BE THE BOSS OF OURSELVES
trainval/SCCG81UbruY/50032 WE SHOULD BOSS THIS CITY
trainval/SCEKKHyxgaw/50001 NOW TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION DID I HAVE ANY AMBITIONS IN POLITICS
trainval/SCEKKHyxgaw/50003 AND THIS WAS A TIME WHEN THEY WERE HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE
trainval/SCEKKHyxgaw/50005 I'M STILL AMAZED AT THE PERFECTION WITH WHICH THE ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS TOGETHER
trainval/SCEKKHyxgaw/50006 HOWEVER TO THE PURISTS TO THOSE WHO ARE OF FAITH THEY WILL TELL YOU
trainval/SCEKKHyxgaw/50007 NOW WHETHER YOU CALL IT RELIGIOSITY WHETHER YOU CALL THIS GREAT SPIRIT BY ANY NAME BRAHMA
trainval/SCEKKHyxgaw/50008 AND THIS IS SOMETHING I WOULD LIKE TO DRAW ATTENTION TO AGAIN TO OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM
trainval/SCEKKHyxgaw/50009 WE HAVE TO DO AWAY WITH THIS ROTE LEARNING
trainval/SCEKKHyxgaw/50010 WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT WE DRIVE THIS CURIOSITY IN THE CHILD AND THEY NEED TO BE CURIOUS
trainval/SCEKKHyxgaw/50011 AND THIS IS WHERE A GREAT DEAL OF EFFORT HAS TO BE DONE TO ACTUALLY MOTIVATE THEM FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE
trainval/SCEKKHyxgaw/50012 WE NEED TO BUILD HER SELF CONFIDENCE FROM A VERY EARLY AGE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE ALSO NEED TO
trainval/SCEKKHyxgaw/50013 LAST YEAR I WAS VERY SHOCKED WHEN I WENT TO A DEBATE ON WOMEN'S DAY
trainval/SCEKKHyxgaw/50014 THEY HAD A SURVEY AND THEY WERE ASKING THESE GIRLS HOW MANY WOMEN INVENTORS WE HAVE HOW
trainval/SCEKKHyxgaw/50015 AND YOU'D BE SHOCKED THAT HARDLY ANYONE KNEW THAT ADA LOVELACE WAS THERE BEHIND COMPUTER
trainval/SCEKKHyxgaw/50016 YESTERDAY I WAS LISTENING TO ONE OF THE TALKS IT WAS THE TALK ABOUT THE NEED FOR AFRICA TO TURN INTO A
trainval/SCEKKHyxgaw/50017 WHY IS THIS SO
trainval/SCEKKHyxgaw/50018 IF YOU WANT TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT AFRICA BECOMING A KNOWLEDGE CONTINENT
trainval/SCEKKHyxgaw/50019 WE'VE SEEN THAT FOR EXAMPLE AFRICA MUST BE FOOD SECURE AFRICA MUST BE ENERGY SECURE AFRICA MUST BE
trainval/SCEKKHyxgaw/50020 SO THE GOAL I'VE GIVEN MYSELF IS OK I'M LEADING MY THIRD LIFE BECAUSE I'VE BEEN AN ACADEMIC I'VE BEEN AN
trainval/SCEKKHyxgaw/50021 I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE PAGES OF THEIR BOOK AND SEE
trainval/SCEKKHyxgaw/50022 IN FACT JULIUS NYERERE HIMSELF HAD BEEN A GREAT ADVOCATE FOR SCIENCE WHEN HE SAID THAT SCIENCE
trainval/ScFWnnQF7A8/50001 WITH VACCINES AND MEDICINES TO TREAT HIV MALARIA TB
trainval/ScFWnnQF7A8/50002 IT IS STILL ROUGH
trainval/ScFWnnQF7A8/50003 THE NEAREST PHARMACY IS 20 KM AWAY
trainval/ScGSlv9dCeY/50001 MOST OF MY PEERS AND ESPECIALLY MY PARENTS COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT SOMEBODY WOULD DO WITH A MAJOR IN
trainval/ScGSlv9dCeY/50002 BE STRONG SHE SAID
trainval/ScGSlv9dCeY/50003 OH I KNOW IT'S A BIG STEP FOR YOU BUT IT'S NOT FOR HOOVER
trainval/ScGSlv9dCeY/50004 BUT THINGS WORKED OUT WELL
trainval/scITIoJvMJ0/50001 HE'S LIKE NO NO
trainval/ScvI1jKxlTM/50001 YOU DON'T GET ONE KITTEN
trainval/ScvI1jKxlTM/50002 I TRY TO KEEP MY OWN FACE SOMEWHAT DISPASSIONATE
trainval/ScvI1jKxlTM/50003 WHAT'S THE CONSEQUENCE
trainval/ScvI1jKxlTM/50004 NOW I MIGHT BE AT GROUND ZERO FOR THIS
trainval/ScvI1jKxlTM/50005 I HAPPEN TO KNOW WHAT THE CONSEQUENCE FOR ME WOULD BE BECAUSE WE'VE HAD FALSE ALARMS
trainval/ScvI1jKxlTM/50006 THEY GET INTERESTED IN SOMETHING
trainval/ScvI1jKxlTM/50007 BUT HERE ARE A COUPLE THINGS I CAN SAY
trainval/ScvI1jKxlTM/50008 TO BEGIN WITH IT'S GOING TO BE A SOCIETY THAT'S WAY IN ADVANCE OF OUR OWN
trainval/ScvI1jKxlTM/50009 I JUST WANDERED AROUND TAKING PHOTOS LIKE THIS ONE JUST FOR SOMETHING TO DO
trainval/ScvI1jKxlTM/50010 I ALSO THINK THAT EXPLORATION IS IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO ADDRESS
trainval/ScvI1jKxlTM/50011 THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT
trainval/ScvI1jKxlTM/50012 SO THAT DOESN'T GET PEOPLE INTERESTED IN SCIENCE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T COMPREHEND WHAT IT'S ABOUT
trainval/ScvI1jKxlTM/50013 SETI ON THE OTHER HAND IS REALLY SIMPLE
trainval/ScvI1jKxlTM/50014 YES TECHNOLOGICALLY IT'S VERY SOPHISTICATED BUT EVERYBODY GETS THE IDEA
trainval/ScvI1jKxlTM/50015 OF EIGHT AND 11
trainval/ScvI1jKxlTM/50016 I HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN TO TALK TO THESE KIDS FOR AN HOUR
trainval/ScvI1jKxlTM/50017 YOU'VE GOT TO GET THEM THERE
trainval/SdBPkbi4SR8/50001 THAT'S TEN BILLION PEOPLE WHO ALL DESERVE FOOD WATER AND SHELTER
trainval/SdBPkbi4SR8/50002 TEN BILLION PEOPLE WHO EVEN THE SMARTEST OF MINDS HAVEN'T REALLY FIGURED OUT EXACTLY HOW WE ARE GOING TO FEED THOSE PEOPLE
trainval/SdBPkbi4SR8/50003 WHEN I WAS SIX WE FINALLY MANAGED TO SCRAPE TOGETHER ENOUGH MONEY FOR THAT
trainval/SdBPkbi4SR8/50004 MY MOTHER TOOK MYSELF AND MY FOUR OTHER SIBLINGS TO THE NETHERLANDS WHERE WE WERE REUNITED WITH MY DAD WHO HAD ALREADY
trainval/SdBPkbi4SR8/50005 THIS IS WHERE I NOW CALL HOME
trainval/SdBPkbi4SR8/50006 MY MOTHER WORKED EXTREMELY HARD THROUGH OUR CHILDHOOD TO PROVIDE FOR HER FIVE CHILDREN BUT IT WASN'T EVER A WALK IN THE PARK
trainval/SdBPkbi4SR8/50007 I WAS ALWAYS THE PERSON TO SAY OH VEGETARIANS ARE WAY TOO PICKY
trainval/SdBPkbi4SR8/50008 AND THEY WOULD JUST LAUGH AT ME THEY JUST CALLED ME STUPID
trainval/SdBPkbi4SR8/50009 SOMEBODY WHO'S ALWAYS INSPIRED ME MY ENTIRE LIFE IS MY MOTHER
trainval/SdBPkbi4SR8/50010 SHE HAD SO MANY THINGS THAT WERE SO DIFFICULT FOR HER BUT NO MATTER HOW MANY COUNTRIES WE HAD TO MOVE NO MATTER HOW MANY
trainval/SdBPkbi4SR8/50011 WELL I'VE GOT THIS FRIEND CALLED TOM HE'S A CHEF AT A PUB IN LONDON WHERE
trainval/SdBPkbi4SR8/50014 SO YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING WHY I'M ASKING YOU THESE QUESTIONS
trainval/SdBPkbi4SR8/50015 SO LEAD BY YOUR OWN EXAMPLE AND INSPIRE ONE ANOTHER
trainval/sDfhSIKFGz0/50001 IF YOU'RE NOT AWARE IT IS THE BRAINCHILD OF BAS LANSDORP
trainval/sDfhSIKFGz0/50002 WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER OPTIONS
trainval/SDjLpMj3BDU/50001 I USED TO PULL MY TRUCK DIRECTLY INTO THE GREENMARKET IN UNION SQUARE TRY DOING THAT TODAY AND YOU'LL GET A LOT OF BAD LOOKS FROM A LOT OF
trainval/SDjLpMj3BDU/50002 BUT YOU KNOW I WASN'T DOING IT BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT ORGANIC OR LOCAL FOOD WAS BETTER FOR THE
trainval/SDjLpMj3BDU/50003 AND IT'S A QUESTION THAT MICHAEL POLLAN ASKED SOME YEARS AGO AS WELL
trainval/SDjLpMj3BDU/50004 AND IF YOU WERE ASKED TO COOK AT THAT EVENT THAT MEANS THAT YOU'VE ARRIVED
trainval/SDjLpMj3BDU/50005 AND I FELT GREAT ABOUT THIS
trainval/SDjLpMj3BDU/50006 I SHOULD'VE KNOWN BETTER
trainval/SDSjySgNSTk/50001 INSTEAD THEY WATCHED THE UNITED STATES AND BRITAIN SUPPORT THE ARCHAIC GULF MONARCHIES THAT EXPORTED
trainval/SDSjySgNSTk/50002 17 YEARS AFTER HER DAUGHTER'S THROAT WAS CUT IN THE STREET SHE TOLD HER SURVIVING DAUGHTERS THAT SHE WAS
trainval/SDSjySgNSTk/50003 WE ARE HOPE
trainval/SDSjySgNSTk/50004 AND WE MUST BE
trainval/SDSjySgNSTk/50005 ANGER AS IRAQI LAWYERS LIKE SAMIRA SALEH AL NAIMI HAVE BEEN TORTURED AND EXECUTED BY ISIS FOR
trainval/SDSjySgNSTk/50006 HAS THE WEST STOOD WITH THEM
trainval/SDSjySgNSTk/50007 I HAVE NO PRETENSIONS TO BE A POET
trainval/sE3gxX5CiW0/50002 THE BRAIN PROVIDES US WITH THE BIOLOGICAL CAPACITY TO ACQUIRE SPEECH
trainval/sE3gxX5CiW0/50003 IT IS CAPTURING THIS DYNAMIC VARIATION IN RESPONSE TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE
trainval/Se8kcnUSuZw/50001 HE'S WHISPERING INTO YOUR EARS
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50001 AND I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHICH IT WAS
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50002 YOU DON'T THINK IN DEPRESSION THAT YOU'VE PUT ON A GRAY VEIL AND ARE SEEING THE WORLD THROUGH THE HAZE
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50003 AND THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAD WHAT SOUNDED AS THEY DESCRIBED IT LIKE TERRIBLY SEVERE DEPRESSION WHO
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50004 PEOPLE WILL SAY NO ONE LOVES ME
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50005 AND YOU SAY I LOVE YOU YOUR WIFE LOVES YOU YOUR MOTHER LOVES YOU
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50006 YOU CAN ANSWER THAT ONE PRETTY READILY AT LEAST FOR MOST PEOPLE
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50007 THE DEPRESSIVE GROUP WAS USUALLY ACCURATE TO WITHIN ABOUT 10 PERCENT AND THE NON DEPRESSED PEOPLE GUESSED
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50008 THINGS ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE NOW I KNOW THAT DEPRESSION IS THE FAMILY SECRET THAT EVERYONE
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50009 WHAT ARE THE MECHANISMS THAT ALLOW PEOPLE TO SURVIVE
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50010 HE'S REALLY THE KIND OF GUY TO WHOM THIS WOULDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE SO YOU KNOW IT'S JUST BETWEEN US
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50011 AND I SAID YES THAT'S FINE
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50012 AND I WENT OUT AND I INTERVIEWED PERSON AFTER PERSON WHO WAS SUFFERING WITH DEPRESSION
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50013 SO I BECAME MUCH MORE TOLERANT OF THE VAST WORLD OF ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50014 AND I GET LETTERS I GET HUNDREDS OF LETTERS FROM PEOPLE WRITING TO TELL ME ABOUT WHAT'S WORKED FOR THEM
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50015 SOMEONE WAS ASKING ME BACKSTAGE TODAY ABOUT MEDITATION
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50016 THAT HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON WITH WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50017 HE WAS WHEN I MET HIM AT A POINT AT WHICH EVERY MONTH HE WOULD HAVE ELECTROSHOCK TREATMENT
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50018 THEN HE WOULD FEEL SORT OF DISORIENTED FOR A WEEK
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50019 THEN HE WOULD FEEL OKAY FOR A WEEK
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50020 THEN HE WOULD HAVE A WEEK OF GOING DOWNHILL
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50021 AND THEN HE WOULD HAVE ANOTHER ELECTROSHOCK TREATMENT
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50022 AND HE HAD THE CINGULOTOMY AND IT WAS INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50023 HE'S NOW A FRIEND OF MINE
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50024 AS I UNWRAPPED IT I BEGAN TO CRY AND MY MOTHER CAME OVER AND SAID ARE YOU CRYING BECAUSE OF
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50025 I'M CRYING NOW AS I WRITE TO YOU
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50026 IT'S NOT THAT I'M SO SAD BUT I GET OVERWHELMED I THINK BECAUSE I COULD HAVE KILLED MYSELF BUT MY
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50027 AND SO I WENT OUT TO TRY TO LOOK AT WHAT WAS BEING DONE FOR POOR PEOPLE WITH DEPRESSION
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50028 AND YET IT TURNS OUT THAT IF YOU HAVE A REALLY LOVELY LIFE BUT FEEL MISERABLE ALL THE TIME YOU THINK WHY DO I FEEL
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50029 I MUST HAVE DEPRESSION
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50030 AND SO WE HAVE AN EPIDEMIC IN THIS COUNTRY OF DEPRESSION AMONG IMPOVERISHED PEOPLE
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50031 AND SO I FOUND AN ACADEMIC WHO WAS DOING A RESEARCH PROJECT IN SLUMS OUTSIDE OF D
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50032 I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO MY CHILDREN
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50033 AND I SAID WHY NOT
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50034 AND SHE SAID IT JUST IS TOO FAR FETCHED
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50035 IT'S JUST TOO IMPLAUSIBLE
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50036 THEY DIDN'T EXTERNALIZE THE DEPRESSION AS AN INVASIVE SPIRIT
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50037 THERE IS THIS FALSE MORAL IMPERATIVE THAT SEEMS TO BE ALL AROUND US THAT TREATMENT OF
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50039 IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS WHEN THAT SYSTEM GETS BROKEN
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50040 THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT I FEEL SAD ABOUT NOW
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50041 WHAT IS THE MECHANISM OF RESILIENCE
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50042 AND WHAT I CAME UP WITH OVER TIME WAS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO DENY THEIR EXPERIENCE AND SAY I WAS
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50043 THOSE WHO CAN TOLERATE THEIR DEPRESSION ARE THE ONES WHO ACHIEVE RESILIENCE
trainval/SeBUcBfkVCo/50044 SO FRANK RUSSAKOFF SAID TO ME IF I HAD A DO OVER I SUPPOSE I WOULDN'T DO IT THIS WAY BUT IN A
trainval/SEDvD1IICfE/50001 SOME EXPERT I WAS ON LEADERSHIP
trainval/SEDvD1IICfE/50002 I KNEW NOTHING
trainval/SEDvD1IICfE/50003 STANDS FOR SOMETHING
trainval/SEDvD1IICfE/50004 A KID OF 5 OR 65 VOTED IN THE SAME WAY
trainval/SeEsTtedvBk/50001 BUT I MANAGED TO MAKE ROOM FOR A COPY OF THE COP 21 AGREEMENT THAT FRENCH PRESIDENT
trainval/SeJwaOCYWwM/50001 I WAS THERE TO STUDY RURAL WOMEN AND WHAT KINDS OF RESOURCES THEY USED AND WHAT KINDS OF SUPPORT THEY NEEDED TO ESCAPE
trainval/SeJwaOCYWwM/50002 THE THIRD PROBLEM THEY HAD
trainval/SeJwaOCYWwM/50003 THE FIRST PART WAS IT WAS A NETWORK OF RURAL WORK SPACES WHERE
trainval/SeJwaOCYWwM/50004 I AM BECAUSE WE ARE
trainval/SeJwaOCYWwM/50005 BUT IT'S BEEN A LONG CHALLENGE OF COURSE
trainval/SeJwaOCYWwM/50006 THEY HAD SEEN BUREAUCRATS DO THAT THEY HAD SEEN RICH LANDLORDS DO THIS
trainval/SeJwaOCYWwM/50007 THEY HAD NEVER SEEN POOR FARM WORKERS LET ALONE WOMEN FARM WORKERS SIT IN A POSTURE OF AUTHORITY AND IT
trainval/SeJwaOCYWwM/50008 IF WE HAVE CASH WE CAN HIDE IT IN OUR KITCHEN JARS
trainval/SeJwaOCYWwM/50009 AND WE SAID WHY DO YOU WANT TO DO THAT
trainval/SeJwaOCYWwM/50010 THEY SAID BECAUSE OUR HUSBANDS WON'T SEE THE BANK STATEMENT LYING AROUND AND HE WON'T DEMAND THAT WE GIVE HIM
trainval/SeJwaOCYWwM/50011 THEY RESISTED THEY WEREN'T VERY HAPPY BUT IN TIME THE HUSBANDS HAVE
trainval/SeJwaOCYWwM/50012 THE FIRST OPTION IS TO STAY IN POVERTY THEY JUST STAY WHERE THEY ARE
trainval/SeJwaOCYWwM/50013 NOW NO ONE WOMAN COULD HANDLE PRODUCING 1000 BAGS A WEEK
trainval/SeJwaOCYWwM/50014 THEY'VE SHOWN US THAT THEY'VE MANAGED TO EASILY
trainval/SeJwaOCYWwM/50015 THE HIGHER COST OF SUSTAINABLE AND ETHICAL PRODUCTS IN THEIR BUDGET
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50001 SO WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT COMPASSION MY MIND IMMEDIATELY WENT TO ONE OF THE CARTOON STRIPS
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50002 BECAUSE AFTER ALL GOD IS JUST
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50003 THEREFORE THERE SHOULD BE JUSTICE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50004 IF YOU PUT BOILING WATER IN IT WILL SHATTER
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50005 WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50006 SO LIKE SNOOPY WE CAN'T JUST LIE THERE AND THINK GREAT THOUGHTS ABOUT OUR NEIGHBORS
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50007 WHAT DOES THIS COMPASSION ENTAIL
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50008 IT ENTAILS UNDERSTANDING THE PAIN OF THE OTHER
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50009 WE ALL I THINK BELIEVE IN COMPASSION
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50010 IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE WORLD RELIGIONS ALL THE MAIN WORLD RELIGIONS YOU'LL FIND WITHIN THEM SOME
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50011 SO IN JUDAISM WE HAVE FROM OUR TORAH THAT YOU SHOULD LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOU
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50012 AND WITHIN JEWISH TEACHINGS THE RABBINIC TEACHINGS WE HAVE HILLEL WHO TAUGHT THAT YOU
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50013 BUT SOMETHING ELSE AS WELL ACTUALLY 18 MINUTES IS IMPORTANT
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50014 WHAT DOES IT MEAN DOUGH BECOMES LEAVEN
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50015 IT MEANS IT GETS FILLED WITH HOT AIR
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50016 I CALL THAT UNITY GOD
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50018 I KNOW WHAT GOD WANTS
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50019 AND HE PUT IT IN THE ARK WITH THE SCROLLS OF THE TORAH
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50020 OH GOD I'M IN SUCH TROUBLE
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50021 I'VE GOT CHILDREN TO FEED
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50023 I'VE GOT NO MONEY
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50024 HE GOES INTO THE SYNAGOGUE
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50025 HE GOES TO THE ARK
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50028 YOU'VE ANSWERED MY QUESTION
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50032 HE GOES IN THERE AND IT'S NOT THERE
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50033 NEXT WEEK WITH RAISINS
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50035 TAKE THE BREAD
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50036 TAKE IT HOME
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50037 WENT ON UNTIL A NEW RABBI CAME
trainval/sEOSCziWuP8/50038 RABBIS ALWAYS SPOIL THINGS
trainval/SeQ8vdtSXB4/50001 I HAVE TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST
trainval/SeQ8vdtSXB4/50002 I FIND THEM DAUNTING A LITTLE BIT UNSETTLING
trainval/SeQ8vdtSXB4/50003 NOW THOSE ARE THE LEGENDS
trainval/SeQ8vdtSXB4/50004 HERE'S SOME BACK STORY
trainval/SeQ8vdtSXB4/50005 IT WAS NOT AS HIS BIOGRAPHER PUT IT THE FORTUNE EITHER FINANCIAL OR PERSONAL
trainval/SeQ8vdtSXB4/50006 HE KNEW THE CABLE BUSINESS INTIMATELY AND FOR ALL ITS FLAWS TCI WAS THE FOURTH LARGEST CABLE COMPANY IN THE UNITED STATES AT THAT POINT IN A
trainval/SeQ8vdtSXB4/50007 AND IF I RECOGNIZE IT WILL I HAVE THE GUTS TO MAKE THE LEAP MYSELF
trainval/SeQ8vdtSXB4/50009 WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK FROM A MOVIE
trainval/SeQ8vdtSXB4/50010 AND THEN I CALLED THE DIRECTOR ANDREW V
trainval/SeQ8vdtSXB4/50011 MCLAGLEN WHO WAS 91 YEARS OLD AND STILL DIRECTS PLAYS UP IN FRIDAY HARBOR WASHINGTON AND THE STORY GOES MORE LIKE THIS
trainval/SF242mxtZN8/50001 AND I REALLY HATED THE MOSQUITOS FOR THAT
trainval/SF242mxtZN8/50002 SO THIS POSES A HUGE ECONOMIC CHALLENGE BECAUSE SAY YOU DO COME UP WITH YOUR GREAT DRUG OR YOUR GREAT VACCINE HOW DO YOU
trainval/SF242mxtZN8/50003 THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN CRASHED MALARIA RESURGED BACK BUT NOW IT WAS EVEN WORSE THAN BEFORE BECAUSE IT WAS
trainval/SF242mxtZN8/50004 YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE ANY VALUE TO A FAMILY WITH MALARIA EXCEPT THAT IT HELPS PREVENT MALARIA
trainval/SF242mxtZN8/50005 THEY HAVE TO SLEEP UNDER THEM EVERY NIGHT
trainval/SF242mxtZN8/50006 AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENING NOW
trainval/SF242mxtZN8/50007 IT TAKES INFRASTRUCTURE
trainval/Sf8j5LFv3nI/50001 SO AS MY BANK MANAGER LIKES TO REMIND ME I'M DOWNWARDLY MOBILE
trainval/Sf8j5LFv3nI/50002 THEY ARE EXAMPLES OF A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM
trainval/Sf994ANuGIY/50001 ALWAYS LOOK A PERSON IN THE EYE
trainval/Sf994ANuGIY/50002 MY FAVORITE VIEW
trainval/Sf994ANuGIY/50003 THE RAIL BENEATH WHICH THE TWO RIVERS CRASHED TOGETHER IN A SENSE CREATING
trainval/Sf994ANuGIY/50004 BUT THE TRUTH IS FLORENCE E
trainval/sFIDCtRXSSo/50001 SHE TOLD US I'M GOING TO SPACE AND I WANT TO DO SOMETHING MEANINGFUL WITH THE DATA OF MY MISSION TO REACH OUT TO
trainval/sFNmulAb4wM/50001 I SAID TO HIM I'VE GOT THE MOST AMAZING IDEA {LG}
trainval/sFNmulAb4wM/50002 AND THAT MONEY FUELS RESEARCH AND THAT RESEARCH WILL GET US TO A CURE
trainval/sFNmulAb4wM/50003 IT WAS THE END OF MOVEMBER
trainval/sFNmulAb4wM/50004 AND I SAID SO AM I
trainval/sFNmulAb4wM/50005 WE NEED TO REDEFINE THE WAY THESE GUYS OPERATE
trainval/SFOCpMAww28/50001 WELL YOU CAN THINK OF IT AS A PATTERN OF INFORMATION THAT HELPS YOU UNDERSTAND AND
trainval/SFOCpMAww28/50002 IF YOU CAN REVEAL A DISCONNECTION IN SOMEONE'S WORLDVIEW THEY'LL FEEL THE NEED TO BRIDGE THAT
trainval/SFOCpMAww28/50003 AND ONCE YOU'VE SPARKED THAT DESIRE IT WILL BE SO MUCH EASIER TO START BUILDING YOUR IDEA
trainval/SFOCpMAww28/50004 FOR EXAMPLE WHEN JENNIFER KAHN WANTED TO EXPLAIN THE INCREDIBLE NEW BIOTECHNOLOGY CALLED CRISPR SHE
trainval/SfQVotsYV0Q/50001 MALA DID THAT TODAY WITH US
trainval/SfQVotsYV0Q/50002 DO ROBOTS HAVE SOULS
trainval/SfQVotsYV0Q/50003 MOORE'S LAW SAYS THAT EVERY SINGLE YEAR THE COMPUTERS ARE GOING TWICE AS FAST
trainval/SfQVotsYV0Q/50004 HOW ARE WE GOING TO KEEP OURSELVES BUSY
trainval/SFW0TEFKCxk/50001 NOW YOU'RE IN YOUR ELEMENT
trainval/SFW0TEFKCxk/50002 AND YOU FLIP IT OVER AND IT'S THE AMINO ACIDS WITH THE PH AT WHICH THEY HAVE DIFFERENT CHARGES
trainval/SFW0TEFKCxk/50003 AND SO I GIVE THIS OUT TO THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
trainval/SFW0TEFKCxk/50004 SO I STAYED UP AT NIGHT AND TALKED TO MY HUSBAND HOW DO I GIVE PRESIDENT OBAMA A PERIODIC TABLE
trainval/SFW0TEFKCxk/50005 SO THIS IS A VIRUS BASED SOLAR CELL
trainval/SGG97dDfZ7E/50001 THESE INCLUDE THE BOSTON MARATHON BOMBINGS IN 2013 AS WELL AS FAILED ATTACKS SUCH AS THE TIME WHEN A MAN NAMED FAISAL
trainval/SGG97dDfZ7E/50002 THESE OPERATIONS WHICH ARE USUALLY LED BY AN INFORMANT PROVIDE THE MEANS AND OPPORTUNITY AND SOMETIMES EVEN THE
trainval/SGG97dDfZ7E/50003 BERKELEY AND A RESEARCH ASSISTANT AND I PUT TOGETHER A DATABASE OF ALL TERRORISM PROSECUTIONS AT THE TIME
trainval/SGG97dDfZ7E/50004 BUT IT WAS MUCH MORE ELABORATE THEY WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS TO PUT MONEY IN SAMI OSMAKAC'S HANDS WHICH HE THEN USED TO PURCHASE
trainval/SGG97dDfZ7E/50005 COMPARE THAN TO JUST 2
trainval/SgjGcBTyScY/50001 IN MY THIRD LESSON I NEEDED TO FIGURE OUT IF WINE FLOUR COULD BE IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO
trainval/SgjGcBTyScY/50002 WHILE AT FIRST THE NUMBERS WERE OVERWHELMING THE FINGER LAKES WINE INDUSTRY PRODUCES OVER 11000
trainval/SgjGcBTyScY/50003 BUT LIKE ALL QUESTIONS AND LESSONS THERE ARE NUMEROUS LAYERS THAT NEED TO BE PEELED IN ORDER FOR THE
trainval/SgjGcBTyScY/50004 THE FARM TO TABLE MOVEMENT
trainval/SgjGcBTyScY/50005 IT'S THE WINE INDUSTRY
trainval/SGMVTJ9ZKVc/50001 WELL WE HAD DATA THAT TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY
trainval/SGnmDWtyhAs/50001 HOW ABOUT THE INVESTOR
trainval/SGnmDWtyhAs/50002 WELL REMEMBER THAT THE LUCK IS WITHIN YOUR CONTROL
trainval/SGnmDWtyhAs/50003 BUFFETT A GUY NEXT TO HIM
trainval/SGnmDWtyhAs/50004 OKAY I'M A LUCKY GUY I WILL ENTER THE BAR AND FIND THE BEST SPOT FOR THAT
trainval/SGnmDWtyhAs/50005 OKAY I GOT LUCKY
trainval/SgOTaXhbqPQ/50001 YOU HEAR THE TRAFFIC
trainval/SgOTaXhbqPQ/50002 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING
trainval/SgOTaXhbqPQ/50003 THINK OF THE NUMBER OF BLIND PEOPLE
trainval/SgsbNR2pIts/50001 AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT BELONGING IS CORRELATED WITH
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50001 I WANTED TO REBEL
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50002 SO WHAT IS THIS NEW MODEL
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50003 THE FIRST PLACE THAT WE SEE THAT COMMUNITY AND NOT MEDICINE CREATES HEALTH IS THE BLUE ZONES
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50004 IT'S NOT JUST COMMUNITY
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50005 WHAT IS IT ABOUT COMMUNITY THAT YOU THINK IS SO POWERFUL
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50006 THEY ATE A LOT MORE ANIMAL FAT ANIMAL PROTEIN
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50007 THEY ALSO SMOKED AND DRANK AS MUCH AS THE OTHER TOWNS AROUND THEM IN AMERICA
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50008 BUT THE OUTCOMES REMAIN THE SAME
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50009 IN FACT THEY HAD LOWER LEVELS OF HEART DISEASE IN THE 1950S WHEN HEART DISEASE WAS ABSOLUTELY
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50010 AND SO THE OTHER THING THAT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO THEM WAS COMMUNITY
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50012 BUT WE CAN TALK ABOUT MICROBES IF YOU PREFER
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50013 SO I JUST WANT TO PREPARE YOU FOR THAT AHEAD OF TIME
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50014 YOU KNOW IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE 20TH CENTURY IT WAS ALL ABOUT OUR INTERACTION WITH GERMS
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50015 IT'S ALL ABOUT THE HUMAN RACE DOMINATING GERMS
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50016 17 YEARS EVEN TODAY
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50017 AND THE HUMAN MICROBIOME SHOWED THAT MORE THAN 99 OF ALL OF THE GERMS THAT LIVE
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50018 AND SINCE THEN IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS THERE'S BEEN A WEALTH OF SCIENCE TO SHOW THAT GERMS
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50019 BUT IN FUNCTIONAL MEDICINE IT TURNS EVERYTHING ON ITS HEAD
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50020 AND IT USES SYMPTOMS AS A WAY TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON AND THE ROOT CAUSE OF DYSFUNCTION
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50021 WE'RE NOT ASKING BRUSSELS FOR PERMISSION WE'RE NOT ASKING LONDON FOR PERMISSION WE JUST HAVE TO
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50022 AND 15000 OF THE PEOPLE THAT GO TO THE CHURCH LOST A COMBINED
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50023 AND BETTING ON IT FOR THE FUTURE OF CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50024 BUT THE MOST EXCITING THING AND WHAT COULD REALLY SCALE THIS UP IS TECHNOLOGY
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50025 TECHNOLOGY IS COMING ALONG AND EMPOWERING COMMUNICATION IN NEW AND EXCITING WAYS
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50026 AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST BENEFICIARIES OF THAT IS COMMUNICATION
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50027 HE HAS A WHOLE COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD THAT EGG EACH OTHER ON TO BE HEALTHIER THROUGH TECHNOLOGY
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50028 SO AGAIN WE SEE THAT IT'S A COMMUNITY OF MICROBES AND NOT MEDICINE THAT CREATES HEALTH
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50029 SO MUCH SO THAT IT'S ALMOST A JOKE IN AMERICA NOW HOW PHARMACEUTICAL REPS COME AND TELL THE DOCTOR WHAT TO DO WITH EACH OF
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50030 I JUST WANT TO TALK A MINUTE ABOUT THE USE OF COMMUNITY IN MEDICINE
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50031 THE FUTURE OF MEDICINE ISN'T GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S DONE TO YOU AND YOU'RE JUST A PASSIVE PATIENT TAKING WHAT THE DOCTOR GIVES YOU
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50032 ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THE EMERGING SCIENCE THAT'S COMING OUT RIGHT NOW CITIZEN SCIENCE PROJECT IS SHOWING THE BEST WAY
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50033 START PLANTING A GARDEN
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50034 AND WHAT ABOUT DOCTORS
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50035 GET TOGETHER GROUPS OF DOCTORS TO LEARN ABOUT FUNCTIONAL MEDICINE
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50036 NOW WHAT IS THE MOST EVIDENCE BASED THING THAT YOU COULD ALL DO TODAY TO START THIS PROCESS OF DEVELOPING
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50037 AND WHAT THEY FOUND IS THE MOST EVIDENCE BASED STRATEGY THE MOST EFFECTIVE STRATEGY
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50038 NOW I WOULD BET THAT THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT COME TO A TEDX EVENT LIKE THIS ARE THOSE PEOPLE WITHIN A
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50039 AND FEEL THE POWER OF NEW COMMUNITY
trainval/sgTjCpBOeCU/50040 AND THE ANSWER IS A RESOUNDING YES
trainval/sGXeX7PPrCI/50001 AND ON THAT FATEFUL DAY I SCARFED DOWN WITH TEARS MY LAST PINT OF CHOCOLATE H AGEN DAZS
trainval/sGXeX7PPrCI/50002 BUT LET'S LOOK AT THE WORLDWIDE TRENDS
trainval/sGXeX7PPrCI/50003 ONE IS CERTAINLY TO PROVIDE NUTRITIONAL GUIDELINES BUT ANOTHER ONE IS TO SUPPORT AGRIBUSINESS
trainval/SgYvy71CSSA/50001 THAT'S ONE OF THE ARCHAIC DUAL FORMS
trainval/SgYvy71CSSA/50002 WHO THEY WERE WE REALLY HAVE NO IDEA WE'RE NOT EVEN SURE WHERE THEY LIVED AND WHO THEY
trainval/SgYvy71CSSA/50003 THEY'RE PART OF THE SAME SOCIAL MECHANISM
trainval/SgYvy71CSSA/50005 NO WONDER NEWSPAPERS ARE DYING
trainval/SgYvy71CSSA/50006 BUT THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION
trainval/SgYvy71CSSA/50007 IT IS AFTER ALL HARD TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING YOU CAN'T PUT INTO WORDS
trainval/SgYvy71CSSA/50008 THAT'S NOT MY JOB
trainval/SGzenQjZSpU/50001 SO THAT WAS REALLY SOMETHING EXCITING
trainval/SH86f9zom10/50001 I'LL TELL YOU WHY
trainval/sHdYaMyR5S8/50001 THEY HAD KILLED MANY MEN RAPED MANY WOMEN
trainval/sHdYaMyR5S8/50003 THE RESULTING INATTENTION TO LOCAL CONFLICTS LEADS TO INADEQUATE PEACEBUILDING IN THE SHORT
trainval/ShFk6FDrZBc/50001 SO YOU MAY WONDER WHY ON EARTH ARE THEY DOING IT
trainval/ShFk6FDrZBc/50002 WHY ARE THEY ENGAGING WITH CYBERSPACE
trainval/ShFk6FDrZBc/50003 WELL MY THEORY IS THAT IT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE CENSORSHIP ACTUALLY IS LESS EFFECTIVE THAN YOU
trainval/ShFk6FDrZBc/50005 NOW YOU ACTUALLY KNOW HOW THEY CONNECT TO EACH OTHER BY LOOKING AT THEIR FACEBOOK PAGE
trainval/sHJZRPWXQ9s/50001 AND I WAS LED TO IT THROUGH A SERIES OF EVENTS
trainval/sHJZRPWXQ9s/50002 AND LATER IN BIOLOGY CLASS I LEARNED THAT IT'S DUE TO A PROCESS CALLED DENATURING WHICH IS WHERE THE PROTEINS WILL CHANGE
trainval/sHJZRPWXQ9s/50003 BASED ON THESE FINDINGS I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU
trainval/sHJZRPWXQ9s/50004 IS IT WORTH IT TO YOU
trainval/sHJZRPWXQ9s/50005 BUT THAT WAS ME YEARS AGO
trainval/sHJZRPWXQ9s/50006 AND I REMEMBER WATCHING MY FAMILY GO THROUGH THAT AND THINKING THAT I NEVER WANTED ANOTHER FAMILY TO FEEL
trainval/sHJZRPWXQ9s/50007 GOT REJECTED BY ALL EXCEPT ONE
trainval/sHJZRPWXQ9s/50008 AND THEN WENT ON MY NEXT SUMMER TO WORK UNDER DR
trainval/sHJZRPWXQ9s/50009 AND THAT IS WHERE THE RESEARCH BEGAN
trainval/sHJZRPWXQ9s/50010 SOUNDS GREAT RIGHT
trainval/sHJZRPWXQ9s/50011 AND THIS TIME THEY NO LONGER RESPOND TO THE DRUG
trainval/sHJZRPWXQ9s/50012 IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM
trainval/sHJZRPWXQ9s/50013 SO THAT'S WHAT WE SET OUT TO DO
trainval/sHJZRPWXQ9s/50014 IT WAS ABOUT FINDING MY PASSION
trainval/sHJZRPWXQ9s/50015 WITH THIS QUESTION IN MIND I STARTED RESEARCHING AND I SOON FOUND THAT INDOOR AIR POLLUTANTS WERE THE CULPRIT
trainval/sHJZRPWXQ9s/50016 BECAUSE I REALIZED THAT IF WE COULD FIND A WAY TO TARGET REMEDIATION WE COULD ALSO FIND A WAY TO
trainval/sHJZRPWXQ9s/50017 FOR EXAMPLE VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS ARE CHEMICAL POLLUTANTS THAT ARE FOUND IN OUR SCHOOLS HOMES AND
trainval/sHJZRPWXQ9s/50018 BUT I WANT EVERYONE HERE TO REIMAGINE A WORLD WHERE INSTEAD OF PRESCRIBING STEROIDS INHALERS AND
trainval/sHJZRPWXQ9s/50019 BUT BEFORE I END MY TALK TODAY I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH ONE SAYING
trainval/sHJZRPWXQ9s/50020 BECAUSE REMEMBER WE SPEND 90 PERCENT OF OUR LIVES INDOORS
trainval/ShswlNMaUSA/50001 EVERYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD CAN AND WILL CONTINUE JUDGING AND EVALUATING YOU
trainval/SHt4qiDRZE8/50001 NOW THE PROBLEM IS THAT OCR IS NOT PERFECT
trainval/SHt4qiDRZE8/50002 WE COULD DO THAT
trainval/SHt4qiDRZE8/50003 UNFORTUNATELY IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE
trainval/SHt4qiDRZE8/50004 FOR EXAMPLE TRANSLATING A TINY FRACTION OF THE WHOLE WEB WIKIPEDIA INTO ONE OTHER LANGUAGE SPANISH
trainval/SHt4qiDRZE8/50005 BUT AT ALL TIMES YOU'RE LEARNING BY DOING
trainval/SHt4qiDRZE8/50006 WE'RE MOSTLY DONE BUILDING IT AND NOW WE'RE TESTING IT
trainval/ShY9QSdaReY/50001 AND JUST FOR YOUR INFORMATION THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF A MAGNETAR IS 1000 TRILLION TIMES THE
trainval/ShY9QSdaReY/50002 WE DEPEND WE RELY ON OTHER METHODS IN ORDER TO STUDY THIS GAMMA RAY LIGHT
trainval/ShY9QSdaReY/50003 AND BEYOND THAT WE RELY ON OTHER METHODS
trainval/ShY9QSdaReY/50004 YET AS ASTRONOMERS WE STUDY A WIDER RANGE OF LIGHT AND WE DEPEND
trainval/ShY9QSdaReY/50005 EXACTLY HOW LONG PEOPLE CANNOT REALLY TELL
trainval/ShY9QSdaReY/50006 IT WAS A VERY STRONG TRANSITION FOR ME IN MANY WAYS
trainval/ShY9QSdaReY/50007 BUT THAT WAS NO END
trainval/ShY9QSdaReY/50008 AND I WANT YOU TO HEAR WHAT I HEARD
trainval/ShY9QSdaReY/50009 AND BECAUSE YOU'RE SIGHTED I'M GIVING YOU A RED LINE INDICATING WHAT INTENSITY OF LIGHT IS BEING CONVERTED INTO
trainval/ShY9QSdaReY/50010 SHE TRANSFORMED INTO A SUPERNOVA AND IN THE PROCESS RELEASING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF
trainval/ShY9QSdaReY/50011 THIS ABILITY TO TRANSFORM DATA INTO SOUND GIVES ASTRONOMY A TREMENDOUS POWER OF
trainval/ShY9QSdaReY/50012 WHEN I LOST MY SIGHT I NOTICED THAT I DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME AMOUNT AND QUALITY OF
trainval/ShY9QSdaReY/50013 SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS ARE VERY EXTREME
trainval/ShY9QSdaReY/50014 BUT THE ONES THAT EMIT GAMMA RAYS ARE EVEN MORE EXTREME
trainval/ShY9QSdaReY/50015 YET INFORMATION ACCESS IS NOT THE ONLY AREA IN ASTRONOMY WHERE THIS IS
trainval/ShY9QSdaReY/50016 WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM IF THEY DEVELOP A DISABILITY
trainval/ShY9QSdaReY/50017 INFORMATION ACCESS EMPOWERS US TO FLOURISH
trainval/SI3v6KS2Zgs/50001 I'M A FEMINIST LIKE I TOLD YOU AND I THINK PERSONAL IS POLITICAL
trainval/SI3v6KS2Zgs/50002 MY STORY IS PERSONAL BUT IT'S ALSO POLITICAL
trainval/SI3v6KS2Zgs/50003 IT'S NOT POLITICAL MERELY BECAUSE IT'S PERSONAL I THINK IT WOULD BE POLITICAL ANYWAY
trainval/SI3v6KS2Zgs/50004 I GOT INTO IT VERY SURPRISINGLY AND VERY INVOLUNTARILY
trainval/SI3v6KS2Zgs/50005 I WAS VISITING THIS SCHOOL IN MAY AS A LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER I'M A FORMER LIBERAL
trainval/SI3v6KS2Zgs/50006 AM I GOING TO TALK ABOUT MY RESEARCH MY POSTDOC
trainval/SI3v6KS2Zgs/50007 THERE WAS A SECOND GRADE CLASS WHO HAD BRAND NEW IPADS AND WE POLITICIANS
trainval/SI3v6KS2Zgs/50008 WHAT AM I GOING TO TALK ABOUT
trainval/SI3v6KS2Zgs/50009 BUT THEN I READ THE TED GUIDELINES AND THEY SAID WE ARE LOOKING FOR SPEAKERS TO SHARE DEEP
trainval/SI3v6KS2Zgs/50010 I KNOW THIS IS STUFF YOU AREN'T SUPPOSED TO SAY IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE EVERYONE LEARNS EVERYTHING AND ALL THE PEOPLE ARE FRIENDS WITH
trainval/SI3v6KS2Zgs/50011 NOT BECAUSE I REGRET ANYTHING OF WHAT I WROTE AND SAID NOT BECAUSE I FELT OR FEEL
trainval/SI3v6KS2Zgs/50012 THIS IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL CONCEPT
trainval/Si644sBMaOY/50001 HOW COULD YOU WANT TO BE HERE
trainval/Si644sBMaOY/50002 NO COURT DATES
trainval/Sid0oc0w3mQ/50001 THEY ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND
trainval/Sid0oc0w3mQ/50003 WHY CAN'T OFFENDERS SOLVE THEIR ECONOMIC PROBLEMS THEMSELVES
trainval/Sid0oc0w3mQ/50004 THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS FOR THAT
trainval/Sid0oc0w3mQ/50006 THIS WAS THE THOUGHT UNDERLYING THE DEBT PROJECT' STARTED BY NETWORK AFTER IMPRISONMENT IN
trainval/SIKqVKyyW6w/50001 AND IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF FUN GOING TO BE CHEEKY IT'S DEFINITELY GOING TO GET MUCKY BECAUSE TO GET TO SEXY WE HAVE
trainval/SIKqVKyyW6w/50002 AND THEN YOU LEARN TO BE ADORED NOT AS AN OBJECT TO BE SEXUALIZED BUT AS A
trainval/SIKqVKyyW6w/50003 ONCE UPON A TIME ACCORDING TO MYTH AND LEGEND WE REVELED IN OUR GODDESTRY AND OUR DIVINE
trainval/sIPvnWZ5O6Q/50001 YOU HAVE THIS INNATE KNOWLEDGE OF IT
trainval/sIPvnWZ5O6Q/50002 BUT YOU WEREN'T THINKING ABOUT CHEMISTRY BACK WHEN YOU WERE ROASTING MARSHMALLOWS
trainval/sIPvnWZ5O6Q/50003 WHO'S YOUR MARKET
trainval/sIPvnWZ5O6Q/50004 AND THAT PAINTED A REALLY CLEAR PICTURE FOR ME
trainval/sIPvnWZ5O6Q/50005 AND FROM THERE I CAN MAKE BETTER CHOICES ABOUT HOW TO BUILD MARKET AND MONETIZE OUR GAME
trainval/sIPvnWZ5O6Q/50006 AND THAT IS WHERE I THINK VIDEOGAMES CAN REALLY SHINE
trainval/sIPvnWZ5O6Q/50007 OR A MORE POIGNANT EXAMPLE IS THE
trainval/sIPvnWZ5O6Q/50008 AND FOLDIT IS REALLY MORE OF A PUZZLE GAME
trainval/SJ0G1iCLzCA/50001 A PART OF ME IS REALLY TRYING TO WORK TOWARD OBSOLESCENCE
trainval/SJ0G1iCLzCA/50002 AND NOW I FIND MYSELF WRITING ALL THESE POEMS AS ADVICE TO MY FUTURE SELF UPON BEING A
trainval/SJ0G1iCLzCA/50003 DON'T TELL ME IT'S WRONG TO WANT TO RAISE A CHILD FROM THIS KIND OF FEAR
trainval/SJ0G1iCLzCA/50004 ANOTHER KNUCKLE IS LOOKING TO CRACK INTO MY DAUGHTER'S SKIN
trainval/SJ0G1iCLzCA/50005 THE WHOLE POINT IS FOR HOPE RIGHT
trainval/SJ0G1iCLzCA/50006 WHAT DID I SEE TO BE EXCEPT MYSELF
trainval/SJ0G1iCLzCA/50007 MY ONE HAND HOLDING TIGHT MY OTHER
trainval/SjaWs87t5UM/50001 THIS IS THE WAY WE'VE BEEN FISHING THE OCEANS OVER THE LAST 50 YEARS
trainval/SjaWs87t5UM/50002 WORLD WAR II WAS A TREMENDOUS INCENTIVE TO ARM OURSELVES IN A WAR AGAINST FISH
trainval/SjaWs87t5UM/50003 WELL THAT'S ONLY HALF THE STORY
trainval/SjaWs87t5UM/50004 I WANT TO DO A HULA BURGER AND THERE'S GOING TO BE A SLICE OF PINEAPPLE ON A BUN
trainval/SjaWs87t5UM/50005 IT'S ACTUALLY A TREMENDOUSLY SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION IT GOES FROM AN EGG TO AN ADULT IN NINE MONTHS
trainval/SjaWs87t5UM/50006 AND SO EVEN THOUGH WE'RE DOING LESS PER FISH TO BRING IT TO THE MARKET WE'RE STILL
trainval/SjaWs87t5UM/50007 THIS EXISTS KIND OF ON PAPER
trainval/SjaWs87t5UM/50008 EVERY TIME I DO A NEW STORY SOMEBODY TELLS ME WE CAN DO ALL THAT
trainval/sJCBM9ajA5s/50001 SO WHY ARE WE DISCOVERING UNACCEPTABLE SIDE EFFECTS ON HALF THE POPULATION AFTER THAT
trainval/sJCBM9ajA5s/50002 AND THANKFULLY SCIENTISTS LIKE DR
trainval/sJKFyDbWVqA/50001 I STARTED RECEIVING E MAILS LIKE CRAZY
trainval/sJKFyDbWVqA/50002 AND AMONG THOSE E MAILS I RECEIVED SOME REALLY INTERESTING JOB OFFERS ALSO
trainval/sJKFyDbWVqA/50004 AND AFTER A FEW WEEKS FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE A WEEKEND PROJECT BUT ACTUALLY IT WASN'T
trainval/sJKFyDbWVqA/50005 AND AT THAT POINT I JUST GAVE UP
trainval/sJKFyDbWVqA/50006 SO I PACKED EVERYTHING IN THE BOX AND I PUT IT IN A CLOSET
trainval/sJKFyDbWVqA/50007 WE WORKED WITH SOME FAMOUS MUSEUMS IN BAY AREA
trainval/sJKFyDbWVqA/50008 HE'LL PROBABLY TELL YOU THAT IT'S THE ONE THAT HE'S WORKING ON RIGHT NOW AND IT'S NOT IN HIS PORTFOLIO
trainval/sJKFyDbWVqA/50009 SO I HAD THIS PROBLEM
trainval/sJKFyDbWVqA/50010 I WENT TO BED THINKING ABOUT THIS PROJECT
trainval/sJKFyDbWVqA/50011 I WOKE UP THINKING ABOUT THIS PROJECT
trainval/sJKFyDbWVqA/50012 AND IT WAS BASICALLY THE ONLY THING I WAS TALKING ABOUT TO ANYONE
trainval/sJKFyDbWVqA/50013 SO I NEEDED TO SOLVE THAT BECAUSE GOING AND DOING LIKE FREELANCE FOR FULL TIME ONCE AGAIN I COULDN'T HAVE TIME TO DO
trainval/sJKFyDbWVqA/50014 SO IT SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY BIG SACRIFICE LIKE NO DINING OUT NO GOING OUT NO BUYING STUFF
trainval/sJKFyDbWVqA/50015 BUT ACTUALLY WAS PROBABLY THE BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE BECAUSE I GOT TO DO SO MANY THINGS
trainval/sJKFyDbWVqA/50016 I GOT TO LEARN SO MANY NEW THINGS
trainval/sJKFyDbWVqA/50017 SO I STARTED THINKING WHAT CAN I MAKE
trainval/sJKFyDbWVqA/50018 I GOT TO PLAY
trainval/sJKFyDbWVqA/50019 AND AFTER A FEW DAYS I REALIZED THAT MAYBE THE BEST THING TO MAKE IS A DIGITAL CLOCK BECAUSE THERE'S THIS NOTION AND FLOW OF
trainval/sJKFyDbWVqA/50020 WHAT'S SO POWERFUL ABOUT PERSONAL PROJECTS
trainval/sJKFyDbWVqA/50021 THE FIRST TIME I FAILED
trainval/sJKFyDbWVqA/50022 SECOND TIME I DIDN'T
trainval/sJKFyDbWVqA/50023 AND THESE ARE POINTS THAT DON'T RELATE ONLY TO DESIGN THEY RELATE TO ANYTHING
trainval/sJKFyDbWVqA/50024 IT HAPPENED TO ME
trainval/sJKFyDbWVqA/50025 AND I REALIZED THAT PERSONAL PROJECT LETS YOU EXPRESS YOURSELF
trainval/sJKFyDbWVqA/50026 AND THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE I HAD LIMITED EXPERIENCE
trainval/sJKFyDbWVqA/50027 THERE ARE NO COMPROMISES
trainval/SJmnB54WRgk/50001 AND IT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW
trainval/SJmnB54WRgk/50002 AND WHY SEVERAL SIM CARDS
trainval/SJmnB54WRgk/50003 THESE ARE REALITIES AND THEY ARE HORRIFIC BUT IT IS NOT THE ONLY REALITY
trainval/sjPRN2XGSts/50001 SHE WAS LOOKING FOR A FINANCE OR ACCOUNTING ROLE AND SHE HAD JUST SPENT THE LAST NINE MONTHS
trainval/sjPRN2XGSts/50002 THE FIRST THING I TOLD TRACY WAS SHE HAD TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE
trainval/sjPRN2XGSts/50003 A LOT OF THE COMMANDS ARE THE SAME
trainval/sjPRN2XGSts/50004 I FOUND POWERPOINT MUCH MORE CHALLENGING BUT NOW I USE POWERPOINT ALL THE TIME
trainval/sjPRN2XGSts/50005 I TELL RELAUNCHERS THAT EMPLOYERS EXPECT THEM TO COME TO THE TABLE WITH A WORKING
trainval/sjPRN2XGSts/50006 THAT'S NOT THE EMPLOYER'S JOB
trainval/sjPRN2XGSts/50007 EMPLOYERS CAN VIEW HIRING PEOPLE WITH A GAP ON THEIR R SUM AS A HIGH RISK PROPOSITION
trainval/sjPRN2XGSts/50008 THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE HAVE COME
trainval/sjPRN2XGSts/50009 AND THERE'S NO REASON WHY THERE CAN'T BE A RETIREE INTERNSHIP PROGRAM
trainval/sjPRN2XGSts/50010 DIFFERENT POOL SAME CONCEPT
trainval/sjPRN2XGSts/50011 SO LET ME TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED WITH TRACY SHAPIRO
trainval/sjPRN2XGSts/50012 THEY'VE PAID FOR HER TO GET HER MBA AT NIGHT
trainval/sjPRN2XGSts/50013 SHE'S EVEN HIRED ANOTHER RELAUNCHER FOR WORK FOR HER
trainval/sjPRN2XGSts/50014 NOW MY GOAL IS TO BRING THE REENTRY INTERNSHIP CONCEPT TO MORE AND MORE
trainval/SjsGSNgmleA/50001 WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WERE AT TED AND YOU GOT TO CONNECT PHYSICALLY WITH EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE ROOM
trainval/SjsGSNgmleA/50002 HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE LIKE ME
trainval/SjsGSNgmleA/50003 JUST ADMIT IT
trainval/SjsGSNgmleA/50005 NOW YOU KNOW HOW TO PLAY IT
trainval/SjsGSNgmleA/50006 YOU CAN TEACH OTHER PEOPLE
trainval/SjsGSNgmleA/50007 HOW MANY OF YOU WON JUST WON THUMB
trainval/SjsGSNgmleA/50008 BECAUSE THERE AREN'T THAT MANY PEOPLE WHO KNOW HOW TO PLAY WE HAVE TO KIND OF ACCELERATE THE PROGRAM MORE THAN A GAME LIKE CHESS
trainval/SjsGSNgmleA/50012 I WILL JUST LEAVE YOU WITH THIS TIP IF YOU WANT TO PLAY AGAIN
trainval/SjsGSNgmleA/50013 THEY'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION
trainval/SjsGSNgmleA/50014 THEY LOOK KIND OF WEAK
trainval/SjsGSNgmleA/50015 SO ERIC WOULD HAVE WON
trainval/SjsGSNgmleA/50016 WE CAN REALLY GO FOR IT
trainval/SjsGSNgmleA/50017 THIS IS TRUE SO IF YOU PLAY THIS GAME WITH ME TODAY FOR JUST ONE SINGLE MINUTE YOU WILL GET TO FEEL
trainval/SjsGSNgmleA/50018 IF YOU HAVE A FREE THUMB WAVE IT AROUND TO MAKE SURE
trainval/SjsGSNgmleA/50019 I SAID MASSIVELY MULTIPLAYER THUMB WRESTLING
trainval/SjsGSNgmleA/50020 YOU WERE LIKE WHAT THE HELL IS SHE TALKING ABOUT
trainval/SjsGSNgmleA/50021 HOW ABOUT SURPRISE
trainval/SjsGSNgmleA/50022 YOU HEARD THAT SOUND GO UP IN THE ROOM
trainval/SjsGSNgmleA/50023 WE HAD EXCITEMENT
trainval/SjsGSNgmleA/50024 YOU GOT TO STAND UP
trainval/SjsGSNgmleA/50025 YOU'VE BEEN SITTING FOR AWHILE SO THE PHYSICAL RELIEF GETTING TO SHAKE IT OUT
trainval/SJWoKsfsSaA/50001 FOR HIGH SPEED FLIGHT THE BENEFIT OF A SCRAMJET OVER A ROCKET IS A ROCKET HAS TO CARRY ITS OWN OXYGEN
trainval/SJWoKsfsSaA/50002 AFTER ALMOST A HALF A CENTURY THE THEORY OF SCRAMJETS WAS FINALLY PROVEN
trainval/SJWoKsfsSaA/50003 YOU'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE THREE TIMES
trainval/SJWoKsfsSaA/50004 THERE'S BEEN A LOT IN THE PRESS THESE DAYS ABOUT SPACE TRAVEL
trainval/SJWoKsfsSaA/50005 HIGH FIVES IN THE ROOM
trainval/SJWoKsfsSaA/50006 WHY IS THAT
trainval/SJWoKsfsSaA/50007 REMEMBER THAT SPECIFIC IMPULSE PLOT
trainval/SJWoKsfsSaA/50008 REMEMBER AS THE SPEED GETS UP THE THRUST GOES DOWN
trainval/SJWoKsfsSaA/50009 SO WHILE I'M WHACKING ON ONE MOLE NEW MOLES POP UP
trainval/SJWoKsfsSaA/50010 SO WE PUT IN A VEHICLE DESIGN AND OUT POPS ITS PERFORMANCE
trainval/SJyE40koQyA/50001 THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE HERE
trainval/SJyE40koQyA/50002 ON A NATIONAL LEVEL OUR PAID WORK IS NOT OPTIONAL
trainval/SJyE40koQyA/50003 OK THIS IS POP QUIZ TIME
trainval/SJyE40koQyA/50004 WE'LL LOOK AT A LOT OF THEM
trainval/SJyE40koQyA/50005 WE USED UP ALL OF OUR TAX RETURNS AND HALF OF OUR SAVINGS DURING MY SIX UNPAID WEEKS
trainval/SJyE40koQyA/50006 I STRUGGLED FOR MONTHS BEING AWAY FROM MY SON
trainval/SJyE40koQyA/50007 FOR MONTHS ALL I REMEMBER IS THE SCREAMING
trainval/SJyE40koQyA/50008 I CRIED IN THE BATHROOM WHILE I WASHED OUT THE PUMP EQUIPMENT
trainval/SJyE40koQyA/50009 I PROMISED MY BOSS THAT THE WORK I DIDN'T GET DONE DURING THE DAY I'D MAKE UP AT NIGHT FROM HOME
trainval/SJyE40koQyA/50010 I SAY WE DON'T NOT UNTIL THEY'RE OF WORKING AND TAX PAYING AND MILITARY SERVING AGE
trainval/SJyE40koQyA/50011 CHILDBIRTH IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE AN ENORMOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL EVENT
trainval/SJyE40koQyA/50012 IN AMERICA TODAY WE ARE AT 1
trainval/SJyE40koQyA/50013 WE HAVE TO STOP FRAMING THIS AS A MOTHER'S ISSUE OR EVEN A WOMEN'S ISSUE
trainval/SK095wuESeE/50001 IN OCTOBER 2010 THE JUSTICE LEAGUE OF AMERICA WILL BE TEAMING UP WITH THE 99
trainval/SK095wuESeE/50002 THOSE ARE BASIC HUMAN VALUES
trainval/SK095wuESeE/50003 AND SO THE BACKSTORY OF THE 99 TAKES PLACE IN 1258 WHICH HISTORY TELLS US THE MONGOLS INVADED BAGHDAD AND
trainval/SK095wuESeE/50004 IT'S A STORY PASSED ON GENERATION AFTER GENERATION
trainval/SK095wuESeE/50005 THE SECOND IS COLUMBUS FINALLY GETS FUNDED TO GO TO INDIA BUT HE GETS LOST
trainval/SK095wuESeE/50006 NOW IT'S VERY EASY TO ASSUME THAT THOSE BOOKS BECAUSE THEY WERE FROM A LIBRARY CALLED BAIT AL HIKMA WERE MUSLIM BOOKS BUT THAT'S NOT THE
trainval/SK095wuESeE/50007 AND HE SAID HI
trainval/SK095wuESeE/50008 WE HAD A BABY
trainval/SK095wuESeE/50010 I BECAME TIMELY
trainval/SK095wuESeE/50011 I'M LICENSED IN NEW YORK STATE
trainval/SK095wuESeE/50012 AND I TOOK AWAY THE NAME OF THE WRITER THE NAME OF THE UNCLEAR EVERYTHING WAS GONE EXCEPT THE FACTS
trainval/SK095wuESeE/50013 RED WAS MADE ILLEGAL
trainval/SK095wuESeE/50014 IN A WORLD LIKE THAT THEY'LL ALWAYS BE A JOB FOR SUPERMAN AND THE 99
trainval/Sk0ywFgMpFk/50001 THEY EACH SMOKED TWO PACKS A DAY EACH NONFILTERED AND BY THE TIME I WAS SIX I COULD ORDER A SOUTHERN COMFORT
trainval/Sk0ywFgMpFk/50002 SO I LOVED WRITING SO MUCH THAT I'D COME HOME FROM SCHOOL AND I WOULD TAKE OUT PIECES OF PAPER AND I WOULD STAPLE THEM
trainval/Sk0ywFgMpFk/50003 AND MY GRANDFATHER HE WAS A WISE MAN AND HE SAW THAT AS A PROBLEM BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT WAS LIKE THE ONE THING I
trainval/Sk0ywFgMpFk/50004 HE WANTED ME TO GO TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL AND HE GAVE ME AN OPTION
trainval/Sk0ywFgMpFk/50005 YOU CAN GO TO HOLY NAME WHICH IS COED OR ST
trainval/Sk0ywFgMpFk/50006 JOHN'S WHICH IS ALL BOYS
trainval/Sk0ywFgMpFk/50007 AND I LOVED THAT THOUGHT OF BEING ABLE TO SHARE MY IDEAS THROUGH THE PRINTED PAGE
trainval/Sk0ywFgMpFk/50008 CELEBRATE YOUR OWN STYLE
trainval/Sk0ywFgMpFk/50009 DON'T DRAW THE WAY YOU'RE BEING TOLD TO DRAW
trainval/Sk0ywFgMpFk/50011 I GRADUATED FROM RISD
trainval/Sk0ywFgMpFk/50012 I SET UP A STUDIO AND I TRIED TO GET PUBLISHED
trainval/Sk0ywFgMpFk/50013 I WOULD SEND OUT MY BOOKS
trainval/Sk0ywFgMpFk/50014 I WOULD SEND OUT HUNDREDS OF POSTCARDS TO EDITORS AND ART DIRECTORS BUT THEY WOULD GO UNANSWERED
trainval/Sk0ywFgMpFk/50015 DO YOU HAVE A JOB YET
trainval/Sk0ywFgMpFk/50016 BUT I KNOW IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
trainval/Sk0ywFgMpFk/50017 NOW I USED TO WORK THE WEEKENDS AT THE HOLE IN THE WALL OFF SEASON PROGRAMMING TO MAKE SOME EXTRA MONEY AS I WAS TRYING TO GET MY FEET OFF
trainval/Sk0ywFgMpFk/50018 AND I RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM AN EDITOR AT RANDOM HOUSE WITH A SUBJECT LINE NICE WORK
trainval/Sk0ywFgMpFk/50019 AND I THOUGHT OH NO
trainval/Sk0ywFgMpFk/50020 AND THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED THAT CHANGED MY LIFE
trainval/sK4rgGgqzmY/50001 WE TRAVERSE TIME AND SPACE THROUGH CLOTHING
trainval/Skl42b9B9yA/50001 THESE MAN MADE STRUCTURES DEEPLY AFFECTED NOT ONLY MY SENSE OF SPACE LINES
trainval/SKx2lfobPuU/50001 ISN'T IT WHY WE'RE HERE
trainval/SKx2lfobPuU/50002 IT WAS A CAN OF WORMS I DIDN'T WANT TO OPEN
trainval/SKx2lfobPuU/50003 PROBLEM WAS PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE ELSE HAD
trainval/SKx2lfobPuU/50004 THE INTERNET HAS BROUGHT PEOPLE TOGETHER IN THE MOST INCREDIBLE OF WAYS
trainval/SKx2lfobPuU/50005 BUT FACE TO FACE COMMUNICATION AND ONLINE COMMUNICATION ARE ACTUALLY IN CONFLICT AS THEY BATTLE
trainval/SKx2lfobPuU/50006 SIDE BY SIDE YET THEY COULDN'T HAVE BEEN FURTHER APART
trainval/SKx2lfobPuU/50008 AND IT'S TRADITIONALLY BEEN THE GO TO SOCIAL PROP FOR MANY
trainval/SKx2lfobPuU/50009 THE DIFFERENCE IS ALCOHOL IS A VERY EFFECTIVE SOCIAL LUBRICANT UP TO A CERTAIN POINT
trainval/SKx2lfobPuU/50010 AND IT WAS IN THESE MOMENTS YOU COULD MAYBE ESCAPE THE HORRORS OF SMALL TALK AND ARRIVE AT
trainval/SKx2lfobPuU/50011 THAT WAS WHEN YOU BONDED THAT WAS WHEN THE MAGIC HAPPENED
trainval/SKx2lfobPuU/50012 IF YOU'VE EVER TRIED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE WHILST THEY'RE GAZING INTO THEIR PHONE YOU WILL NOTICE AFTER A
trainval/SKx2lfobPuU/50013 THEY ARE BARELY EVEN KNOW YOU'RE THERE
trainval/SKx2lfobPuU/50014 YOU COULD BE ON FIRE AND THEY PROBABLY WOULDN'T NOTICE
trainval/SKx2lfobPuU/50015 WELL IN THE AFTERMATH OF MY VIRAL ACTIVITY I WAS CONTACTED BY VARIOUS MOVEMENTS SUCH AS
trainval/SKx2lfobPuU/50016 IT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD
trainval/SKx2lfobPuU/50017 THE BRAIN GETS JUST 10 OF ITS INFORMATION FROM THE OPTIC NERVE
trainval/SKx2lfobPuU/50018 SO WE ARE ALREADY LIVING IN A VIRTUAL REALITY OF OUR OWN MAKING EVEN WITHOUT OUR
trainval/SKx2lfobPuU/50019 THE ONLY TIME WE ARE ABLE TO BREAK OUT OF THIS BUBBLE PERSPECTIVE IS WHEN WE COMMUNICATE
trainval/SKx2lfobPuU/50020 WE MUST TRY HARDER THAN THAT
trainval/Skxa33RVVh4/50001 ALL THE HAPPINESS IS IN OUR SURROUNDINGS
trainval/sLFqwXqe4Yk/50001 WELL THE ANSWER IS YOU DON'T WANT TO DRINK IT UNTIL IT'S BEEN TREATED A LITTLE BIT
trainval/sLFqwXqe4Yk/50002 WELL IN CALIFORNIA WE ALREADY RECYCLE ABOUT 40 BILLION GALLONS A YEAR OF WASTEWATER THROUGH THE
trainval/sLFqwXqe4Yk/50003 AMONG THE DIFFERENT CHOICES WE HAVE IT'S PROBABLY THE MOST ENERGY INTENSIVE AND POTENTIALLY ENVIRONMENTALLY DAMAGING OF
trainval/sLFqwXqe4Yk/50004 LET'S CREATE A WATER SUPPLY THAT USES LOCAL SOURCES AND LEAVES MORE WATER IN THE ENVIRONMENT FOR
trainval/sLiM2SizFl4/50001 IT'S OUR RESPECT
trainval/sLiM2SizFl4/50002 THE MOTHER AND BABY'S HOMES WERE OFTEN RUN BY NUNS
trainval/sLiM2SizFl4/50003 I WAS STARTING TO STAY OUT A LITTLE BIT LATE ETC
trainval/sLiM2SizFl4/50004 THEY'VE HAD THREE OTHER CHILDREN
trainval/sLiM2SizFl4/50005 SO THIS WAS AN OPPORTUNITY
trainval/sLiM2SizFl4/50006 BUT I WILL ASK GOD FOR FORGIVENESS
trainval/sLiM2SizFl4/50007 I WASN'T CHARGED FOR ANYTHING
trainval/sLiM2SizFl4/50008 I HADN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG
trainval/sLiM2SizFl4/50009 I HAVE TO TELL IT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ONE TO PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER
trainval/sLiM2SizFl4/50010 I TRIED PRAYING
trainval/sLiM2SizFl4/50011 I DON'T MEAN CHILDREN
trainval/sLo97Bu8Fo0/50001 SO I WANT TO BEGIN WITH AN EVERYDAY STORY
trainval/sLo97Bu8Fo0/50002 SOME EVEN SAID I HAD A POLITICAL MOTIVE
trainval/SltDJynTduY/50001 I BROKE MY RIGHT ARM
trainval/SltDJynTduY/50002 I BROKE MY COLLARBONE
trainval/SltDJynTduY/50003 I BROKE SOME BONES IN MY FEET
trainval/SltDJynTduY/50004 MY HEAD WAS CUT OPEN ACROSS THE FRONT LIFTED BACK EXPOSING THE SKULL UNDERNEATH
trainval/SltDJynTduY/50006 THEY CUT ME LITERALLY CUT ME IN HALF
trainval/SltDJynTduY/50007 THEY TOOK OUT TWO OF MY BROKEN RIBS AND THEY REBUILT MY BACK L1 THEY REBUILT IT THEY TOOK OUT
trainval/SltDJynTduY/50008 THEN THEY STITCHED ME UP THEY TOOK AN ENTIRE HOUR TO STITCH ME UP
trainval/SltDJynTduY/50009 I WOKE UP IN INTENSIVE CARE AND THE DOCTORS WERE REALLY EXCITED THAT THE OPERATION HAD BEEN A SUCCESS BECAUSE AT THAT
trainval/SltDJynTduY/50010 YOU'LL HAVE TO USE A CATHETER FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
trainval/SltDJynTduY/50011 I HAD NO MOVEMENT IN MY LEGS
trainval/SltDJynTduY/50012 I HAD TIGHT STOCKINGS ON TO PROTECT FROM BLOOD CLOTS
trainval/SltDJynTduY/50013 I HAD ONE ARM IN PLASTER ONE ARM TIED DOWN BY DRIPS
trainval/SltDJynTduY/50014 I HAD A NECK BRACE AND SANDBAGS ON EITHER SIDE OF MY HEAD AND I SAW MY WORLD THROUGH A MIRROR THAT WAS SUSPENDED
trainval/SltDJynTduY/50015 AND I SAID WHAT
trainval/SltDJynTduY/50016 I WANTED MY OLD LIFE BACK
trainval/SltDJynTduY/50017 I WAS NO LONGER TIED TO A SET PATH
trainval/SltDJynTduY/50018 I SAID WELL I HAVE TO GET A FRIEND TO DRIVE ME BECAUSE I CAN'T DRIVE
trainval/SltDJynTduY/50019 YOU'RE IN A WHEELCHAIR
trainval/SltDJynTduY/50020 IS THAT A PROBLEM
trainval/SltDJynTduY/50021 AND THEN I THOUGHT WHY STOP THERE
trainval/SLyoVkOl24E/50001 AND JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE SAYS
trainval/Sm5xFSUYgdg/50001 GAPMINDER ASKED THE PUBLIC IN SWEDEN
trainval/Sm5xFSUYgdg/50002 THIS IS HOW THEY ANSWERED
trainval/Sm5xFSUYgdg/50003 SO ALREADY THE PILOTS REVEAL THIS THAT SO MANY IN THE PUBLIC SCORE WORSE THAN RANDOM SO WE HAVE TO THINK
trainval/Sm5xFSUYgdg/50004 GIVE IT TO THEM AND MEASURE WHAT THE MEDIA KNOW
trainval/Sm5xFSUYgdg/50005 EVERYBODY ANSWERED THAT QUESTION YEAH I DRIVE CARS BETTER
trainval/Sm5xFSUYgdg/50006 FIRST WE NEED TO MEASURE IT AND THEN WE NEED TO CURE IT
trainval/Sm5xFSUYgdg/50007 AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN FOR THE FIRST TIME THE INFORMAL RESULTS FROM A CONFERENCE WITH U
trainval/Sm5xFSUYgdg/50008 ALL DIFFERENT SECTORS HAVE FACTS AND THERE ARE ORGANIZATIONS TRYING TO SPREAD AWARENESS ABOUT THESE FACTS
trainval/Sm5xFSUYgdg/50009 OKAY THIS LITTLE SHORTLIST WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH IT
trainval/Sm5xFSUYgdg/50010 THAT WILL HELP YOU SCORE BETTER ON OUR TESTS
trainval/Sm5xFSUYgdg/50011 DID YOU SEE HOW IT MOVED
trainval/SMBiP3G2Pzc/50001 IF THE DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA HAD TO BE BROADENED WHY WERE THEY SO NARROW IN THE FIRST PLACE
trainval/SMBiP3G2Pzc/50002 WHY WERE CASES OF AUTISM SO HARD TO FIND BEFORE THE 1990S
trainval/SMBiP3G2Pzc/50003 ONE OF THE TRAGIC THINGS ABOUT THIS OUTBREAK IS THAT MEASLES WHICH CAN BE FATAL TO A
trainval/SMBiP3G2Pzc/50004 HE ONCE BRAGGED THAT HE HAD TURNED NINE OUT OF 10 KIDS REFERRED TO HIS OFFICE AS AUTISTIC BY OTHER
trainval/SMBiP3G2Pzc/50005 THESE CHANGES WEREN'T HAPPENING IN A VACUUM
trainval/SMBiP3G2Pzc/50006 THE PAPER OFFERED AN ALTERNATE STORY OF AUTISM
trainval/SMi3rHuK0c4/50001 COULD IT BE BAD NEWS FROM THE TAX OFFICE
trainval/SMi3rHuK0c4/50002 DON'T THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU STILL WANT TO DO THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
trainval/SMi3rHuK0c4/50003 I CHOOSE NOT TO IGNORE THE ENVELOPES ANYMORE
trainval/SmoW9jvvMr4/50001 WHAT DOES CURIOSITY FEEL LIKE
trainval/SmoW9jvvMr4/50002 WE CAN DELIVER THESE TOOLS TO PEOPLES' FINGERTIPS IN THE CONTEXTS THAT MATTER MOST
trainval/SmoW9jvvMr4/50003 OR STEP OUT OF IT
trainval/SmqSHqRnngc/50001 THIS DOESN'T REPRESENT HOW WE THINK TODAY
trainval/SmqSHqRnngc/50002 IN MOST MAINSTREAM INTERNATIONAL BALLROOM COMPETITIONS SAME SEX COUPLES ARE RARELY RECOGNIZED ON THE FLOOR AND IN MANY
trainval/SmqSHqRnngc/50003 AND THEN SWITCH BACK
trainval/SmqSHqRnngc/50004 THE PERSON FOLLOWING CAN ELECT TO TAKE OVER THE LEAD OR THE PERSON LEADING CAN CHOOSE TO SURRENDER IT ESSENTIALLY MAKING IT A
trainval/SmqSHqRnngc/50005 THE SECRET LIES IN WHAT MADE LISA SEE OUR INITIAL DEMONSTRATION AS POLITICAL
trainval/SmsYxDvdcYc/50001 SHOULDN'T WE BE TALKING ABOUT THIS STUFF AND LEARNING HOW TO DEAL WITH IT
trainval/SmsYxDvdcYc/50002 DO YOU TRY TO RESCUE THEM FROM THEIR BAD FEELINGS BY SAYING THINGS LIKE OH AT LEAST HE
trainval/SmsYxDvdcYc/50003 I'M ASKING YOU TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
trainval/SmsYxDvdcYc/50004 TALK TO YOUR KIDS ABOUT WHAT GRIEF MIGHT LOOK LIKE
trainval/SmsYxDvdcYc/50005 RECENTLY I READ A BOOK BY DR
trainval/SmsYxDvdcYc/50006 PAUL KALANITHI CALLED WHEN BREATH BECOMES AIR
trainval/SmsYxDvdcYc/50007 IN THE BOOK HE WROTE ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH PATIENTS WHO ARE DYING
trainval/SmsYxDvdcYc/50008 THINK ABOUT WHY YOUR LIFE IS MEANINGFUL
trainval/SmsYxDvdcYc/50009 I PROMISE THAT'S NOT THE CASE
trainval/SMTRxRO5SRA/50001 BY THE TIME THEY GOT TO ALGEBRA THEY HAD SO MANY GAPS IN THEIR KNOWLEDGE THEY COULDN'T ENGAGE WITH IT
trainval/SMTRxRO5SRA/50002 WHAT'S VARIABLE IS WHEN AND HOW LONG A STUDENT ACTUALLY HAS TO WORK ON SOMETHING AND WHAT'S FIXED IS THAT THEY
trainval/SMTRxRO5SRA/50003 BUT NOW TODAY IT'S NO LONGER IMPRACTICAL
trainval/SMTRxRO5SRA/50004 WE HAVE THE TOOLS TO DO IT
trainval/SMTRxRO5SRA/50005 STUDENTS SEE AN EXPLANATION AT THEIR OWN TIME AND PACE
trainval/SMTRxRO5SRA/50006 THERE'S ON DEMAND VIDEO FOR THAT
trainval/SMTRxRO5SRA/50008 AND SO I'M PRETTY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT IT
trainval/SMTRxRO5SRA/50009 I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A PRETTY EXCITING TIME TO BE ALIVE
trainval/SMTRxRO5SRA/50010 BUT WHAT IF THAT ESTIMATE IS JUST BASED ON YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE IN A NON MASTERY FRAMEWORK YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE WITH
trainval/sNbGUSI9HWw/50002 IT'S NOT A PAID EVENT
trainval/sNbGUSI9HWw/50003 SO WHO IS SHOWCASING CULTURE
trainval/snkrS1C2e7U/50001 THAT'S WHERE I REALIZED I WAS GOING WRONG
trainval/snkrS1C2e7U/50002 LET ME BACK UP A LITTLE BIT
trainval/snkrS1C2e7U/50003 BUT THOSE WERE TEMPORARY SATISFACTIONS
trainval/snkrS1C2e7U/50004 HOW DID I TURN MY LIFE AROUND
trainval/snkrS1C2e7U/50005 MY MOM STARTED SHORTLY AFTER THEY GOT MARRIED
trainval/snkrS1C2e7U/50006 I SWITCHED MY MAJOR ABOUT 4 TIMES BEFORE FINALLY LANDING ON INTERNATIONAL STUDIES AND EVENTUALLY CHOOSING PUBLIC HEALTH
trainval/snkrS1C2e7U/50007 SO WHAT IS MEDITATION
trainval/snkrS1C2e7U/50008 ONE I'D ALWAYS STRUGGLED WITH SELF CONFIDENCE AND I WOULD SET MY STANDARDS FOR MYSELF SO HIGH THAT ANYTIME
trainval/snkrS1C2e7U/50009 WHAT THIS TAUGHT ME WAS I HAD COME TO POINT WHERE I HATED SILENCE
trainval/snkrS1C2e7U/50010 IT'S WRITER'S BLOCK IT'S NOT UNDERSTANDING A CONCEPT AT SCHOOL
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50001 AND WE DIDN'T KNOW IF RITA EXISTED OR IF IT WAS A FAKE NAME
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50002 BUT WE STARTED LOOKING AND WE USED FREE INTERNET TOOLS TO DO SO
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50005 IT TOOK THAT LONG FOR ANYONE TO HAVE ANY IMPACT AND GET SOME FEEDBACK
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50006 AND THAT'S CHANGED NOW BECAUSE AS JOURNALISTS WE INTERACT IN REAL TIME
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50007 WE'RE NOT IN A POSITION WHERE THE AUDIENCE IS REACTING TO NEWS
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50008 THEY'RE HELPING US FIND THE NEWS
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50009 THEY'RE HELPING US FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE BEST ANGLE TO TAKE AND WHAT IS THE STUFF THAT THEY WANT TO HEAR
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50010 SO IT'S A REAL TIME THING
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50011 IT'S MUCH QUICKER
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50012 IT'S ON THE INPUT SIDE
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50013 EVERYONE IN THE WORLD HYPOTHETICALLY HAD THE POTENTIAL TO KNOW THAT AN EARTHQUAKE WAS HAPPENING IN MANAGUA
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50014 IT'S CONCERN WITH HOW WE GET INFORMATION AND HOW WE GATHER THE NEWS
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50015 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS EVERY MINUTE THERE ARE 72 MORE HOURS OF VIDEO ON YOUTUBE
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50016 SO THAT'S EVERY SECOND MORE THAN AN HOUR OF VIDEO GETS UPLOADED
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50017 AND IN PHOTOS INSTAGRAM 58 PHOTOS ARE UPLOADED TO INSTAGRAM A SECOND
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50018 MORE THAN THREE AND A HALF THOUSAND PHOTOS GO UP ONTO FACEBOOK
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50019 THE ONLY PROBLEM IS WHEN YOU HAVE THAT MUCH INFORMATION YOU HAVE TO FIND THE GOOD STUFF AND THAT CAN BE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT WHEN
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50020 AND NOWHERE WAS THIS BROUGHT HOME MORE THAN DURING HURRICANE SANDY
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50021 THEY COULDN'T REALLY CONNECT
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50022 AND HOW DO YOU BUILD A LIST LIKE THAT FROM SCRATCH
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50024 YOU DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A SCRAPE
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50025 YOU DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A RE UPLOAD
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50026 AND YOU HAVE TO DO THAT INVESTIGATIVE WORK
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50027 WE FOUND THEM IN PENNSYLVANIA NEVADA AND FLORIDA
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50028 SO WE WENT AND WE LOOKED FOR A SECOND FREE INTERNET TOOL CALLED WOLFRAM ALPHA AND WE CHECKED THE WEATHER REPORTS FOR THE DAY IN WHICH THIS VIDEO
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50029 THREE DIFFERENT SOURCES SAID THREE DIFFERENT THINGS ABOUT THE BRIDGE
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50030 THEY SAID ONE THE BRIDGE DOESN'T EXIST
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50031 ANOTHER ONE SAID THE BRIDGE DOES EXIST BUT IT'S NOT IN HAMA
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50032 IT'S SOMEWHERE ELSE
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50033 AND THE THIRD ONE SAID I THINK THE BRIDGE DOES EXIST BUT THE DAM UPSTREAM OF THE BRIDGE WAS CLOSED SO
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50034 SO THAT WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT GAVE US A CLUE
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50035 I'VE GOT TO GO BACK NOW TO MY THREE SOURCES AND LOOK AT WHAT THEY TOLD ME THE ONE WHO SAID THE BRIDGE DIDN'T EXIST THE ONE WHO SAID THE
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50036 AND THAT'S PART OF THE JOY OF THIS
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50037 ALTHOUGH THE WEB IS RUNNING LIKE A TORRENT THERE'S SO MUCH INFORMATION THERE THAT IT'S INCREDIBLY HARD TO SIFT AND GETTING
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50038 WE HAVE FREE INTERNET TOOLS THAT ALLOW US HELP US DO THIS KIND OF INVESTIGATION
trainval/sNV4yIyXXX0/50039 TRUTH IS A VALUE
trainval/SNzyG5RzZyY/50001 BECAUSE WHEN YOU ADJUST YOUR MIND YOU ADJUST TO SUCCEED
trainval/SoJnEQ6bJKE/50001 SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL
trainval/SoJnEQ6bJKE/50002 NOW SHE IS LIKE ME
trainval/SoJnEQ6bJKE/50003 HELPING A FRIEND HAVE SOMETHING TO PUT ON THEIR APPLICATIONS FOR COLLEGE
trainval/SoJnEQ6bJKE/50004 REAL FAST SHE GOES I AM GOING TO MISS YOU
trainval/soqnBdPOwoo/50001 AND ONE OF THEM IS MOVEMENT AND MIME LIKE I JUST SHOWED YOU
trainval/soqnBdPOwoo/50002 AND THEY WANTED TO TALK TO JAMES ON THEIR FACEBOOK PAGE
trainval/soqnBdPOwoo/50003 MIME AND DRAMA ARE MY FAVORITE ART FORMS
trainval/speKlXgUTX8/50001 WHAT ELSE WE HAVE IS DATA
trainval/SPLooRl0PSU/50002 AT THE END OF EVERY GAME I'D CALCULATE MY STATISTICS CLOSE MY EYES AND IMAGINE STUART SCOTT READING THOSE
trainval/SPLooRl0PSU/50003 I STARTED TUTORING KIDS
trainval/SPLooRl0PSU/50004 AND I SAW MARK'S FACE JUST LOSE ALL OF ITS EXUBERANCE
trainval/SPLooRl0PSU/50005 THEY LOOK AT ME LIKE I'M CRAZY THEY CHECK THE CALENDAR TO MAKE SURE IT'S NOT APRIL FOOLS
trainval/SPLooRl0PSU/50006 SO EVENTUALLY WE WANT TO HAVE A SUITE OF PRODUCTS AND PROGRAMS THAT WORK WITH OTHER BRANDS AND SPORTS LEAGUES TO
trainval/SPLooRl0PSU/50007 HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT DOING THAT
trainval/SpQ1BCdSTTI/50001 COULD WE ENGINEER NEW WAYS OF MOURNING NEW RITUALS FOR REMEMBERING
trainval/sPQViNNOAkw/50001 IT CAN BE FOR PROFIT OR NOT PROFIT
trainval/sPQViNNOAkw/50002 I'M GOING TO ILLUSTRATE IT WITH SOME FAIRLY CONCRETE EXAMPLES BUT ALWAYS POINTING TO THE BROADER THEMES
trainval/sPQViNNOAkw/50003 HOW DO YOU ORGANIZE A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS SO THAT THE OUTPUT OF THE GROUP IS SOMETHING COHERENT AND OF LASTING
trainval/sPQViNNOAkw/50004 YOU LOSE THE RIGHT TO SHAPE PEOPLE'S WORK WHEN IT'S VOLUNTEER EFFORT BUT YOU ALSO SHED THE INSTITUTIONAL
trainval/sPQViNNOAkw/50005 YOU RAISE SOME RESOURCES
trainval/sPQViNNOAkw/50006 THAT IS A POINT TO POINT REPLACEMENT OF COORDINATION WITH PLANNING
trainval/sPQViNNOAkw/50007 WE'RE NOW ABLE TO DO THAT KIND OF THING WITH GROUPS
trainval/sPQViNNOAkw/50008 TO SAY INSTEAD OF WE MUST MAKE AN ADVANCE PLAN WE MUST HAVE A FIVE YEAR PROJECTION OF WHERE THE WIKIPEDIA IS GOING TO
trainval/sPQViNNOAkw/50009 YOU FOUND SOMETHING
trainval/sPQViNNOAkw/50010 IT'S TAKEN OVER A WIDER GEOGRAPHIC AREA
trainval/sPQViNNOAkw/50011 THE FACT THAT A SINGLE PROGRAMMER CAN WITHOUT HAVING TO MOVE INTO A PROFESSIONAL RELATION TO AN
trainval/sPQViNNOAkw/50012 I THINK THAT THIS IS A REALLY PROFOUND CHANGE IN THE WAY HUMAN AFFAIRS ARE ARRANGED
trainval/sPQViNNOAkw/50013 AND I USE THAT WORD ADVISEDLY
trainval/sPQViNNOAkw/50014 WEB LOGGING IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF MASS AMATEURIZATION
trainval/sPQViNNOAkw/50015 HOW WILL THEY SHARE IDEAS AND OPINIONS
trainval/sPQViNNOAkw/50017 A SUPPORT GROUP IS SIMPLY A SMALL GROUP THAT WANTS TO MAINTAIN A WAY OF LIVING IN THE CONTEXT OF A
trainval/sPQViNNOAkw/50018 AND THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ONE ARENA AT A TIME ONE INSTITUTION AT A TIME
trainval/sPQViNNOAkw/50019 BUT THE POINT IS THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A MASSIVE READJUSTMENT
trainval/SpSGKCr8rq8/50001 HE HAS NO CHOICE
trainval/SPSq3cW672s/50001 EVERY TIME THIS HAPPENS WE'RE BECOMING MORE AND MORE DESENSITIZED
trainval/SPSq3cW672s/50002 I HAD JUST WALKED INTO THE LIBRARY WITH MY BEST FRIEND IN ORDER TO MEET OTHERS PREPARING TO GO TO LUNCH
trainval/SPSq3cW672s/50003 I WAS CONFUSED
trainval/SPSq3cW672s/50004 BUT MY UNDERSTANDING OF PAIN THAT DAY WAS NOTHING LIKE MY UNDERSTANDING OF PAIN TODAY
trainval/SPSq3cW672s/50005 THE ETHICAL DILEMMA IMMEDIATELY BECAME DO I ISSUE THIS PERSON NARCOTICS IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM HAPPY OR DENY THEM AND
trainval/SPSq3cW672s/50006 I HAD NO IDEA OF WHAT THESE MEDICATIONS WERE EVEN SUPPOSED TO DO
trainval/SPSq3cW672s/50007 ALL I KNEW AT AGE 17 WAS THAT A LOT OF HIGHLY EDUCATED PEOPLE HAD PRESCRIBED ME MEDICATIONS THAT WERE INTENDED TO MAKE ME FEEL
trainval/SPSq3cW672s/50008 BUT MY EMOTIONAL PAIN WAS AN ABSOLUTE TEN
trainval/SPSq3cW672s/50009 AND AS ADDICTION ALWAYS DOES OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT DECADE MY TOLERANCE CONTINUED TO BUILD MY LIFE CONTINUED
trainval/SPSq3cW672s/50010 I'M BETTING YOU CAN POINT TO AN ELEMENT OF UNADDRESSED OR UNRESOLVED EMOTIONAL PAIN IN THAT PERSON
trainval/SPSq3cW672s/50011 WITH SHORT TERM PAIN MANAGEMENT MOST WOULD MAKE A FULL RECOVERY
trainval/SPSq3cW672s/50012 BUT NOW IMAGINE SUSTAINING THAT EXACT SAME INJURY ONLY THIS TIME YOUR CLOSE FRIEND WAS SKIING NEXT TO YOU
trainval/SPSq3cW672s/50013 THIS DATA IS APPALLING TO ME
trainval/SPSq3cW672s/50014 ADDICTION IS THE ONLY DISEASE WHERE WE COMMONLY WAIT UNTIL IT'S AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF ACUITY BEFORE WE TRY TO DO
trainval/SPSq3cW672s/50015 EMOTIONAL PAIN IS TOXIC IT'S PERVASIVE AND SOCIETY HAS PROGRAMMED US TO AVOID IT
trainval/SPSq3cW672s/50016 BUT ACHIEVING POST TRAUMATIC GROWTH REQUIRES THAT YOU LEAN INTO THE PAIN
trainval/SPSq3cW672s/50017 IN RECOVERY WE OFTEN SAY YOU KEEP WHAT YOU HAVE BY GIVING IT AWAY
trainval/SQB9zNWw9MA/50001 A FUN EXAMPLE BUT IT DOES ILLUSTRATE THREE THINGS IMPORTANT FOR ENCRYPTION
trainval/SQB9zNWw9MA/50002 HOWEVER RAPID INCREASES IN COMPUTATIONAL POWER ARE PUTTING AT RISK A NUMBER OF THE KEY
trainval/SQB9zNWw9MA/50003 EXCEPT THIS TIME INSTEAD OF A CALL TO GIVE JAMES THE CODE WE'RE GOING TO USE QUANTUM EFFECTS
trainval/SqCWAsd2GP8/50001 THE AMERICAN INVENTION IS THE CROSSWORD PUZZLE AND THIS YEAR WE ARE CELEBRATING THE 100TH
trainval/SQdPW8JrYzQ/50002 SO I FIGURED I HAD TO KNOCK IT ON THE HEAD
trainval/SQe8cR4Jl10/50001 THAT'S THEIR PROBLEM
trainval/SQe8cR4Jl10/50002 SOME PEOPLE MIGHT FEAR SHARKS
trainval/SQe8cR4Jl10/50003 SOME PEOPLE MIGHT FEAR DEATH
trainval/SQe8cR4Jl10/50004 YOU DON'T BEAT IT ONCE AND IT'S GONE FOREVER
trainval/SQe8cR4Jl10/50005 IT'S SOMETHING YOU LIVE WITH
trainval/SQe8cR4Jl10/50006 IT'S SOMETHING YOU LIVE IN
trainval/SQe8cR4Jl10/50007 THAT'S WHAT KEEPS YOU FROM GETTING HELP
trainval/SQe8cR4Jl10/50008 YOU'RE WRONG BECAUSE IT'S THE OPPOSITE
trainval/SqgSz1UmcBM/50001 THAT'S A GOOD THING
trainval/SqgSz1UmcBM/50002 BUT IN EVERYDAY LIFE WE CAN FORGET ABOUT IT
trainval/SqgSz1UmcBM/50003 SO SCHR DINGER SPECULATED THAT MAYBE QUANTUM MECHANICS PLAYS A ROLE IN LIFE
trainval/SqgSz1UmcBM/50004 AND IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A MYSTERY HOW THEY DO THIS
trainval/SqgSz1UmcBM/50005 QUANTUM COHERENCE IS THE IDEA OF QUANTUM ENTITIES MULTITASKING
trainval/SqgSz1UmcBM/50006 IT'S AN OBJECT THAT BEHAVES LIKE A WAVE SO THAT IT DOESN'T JUST MOVE IN ONE DIRECTION OR THE OTHER
trainval/SqgSz1UmcBM/50007 NOW THE EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELD IS VERY VERY WEAK IT'S 100 TIMES WEAKER THAN A FRIDGE MAGNET AND YET IT AFFECTS
trainval/sQNtu4kpd64/50001 SOME WOULD SAY IT'S FOOD
trainval/sQNtu4kpd64/50002 NO JOBS ARE A SUBSET OF WORK
trainval/sQNtu4kpd64/50003 HE CREATES AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WORK IS CREATED AND WE GO OUT THERE AND SEEK THE JOBS THAT SOMEBODY
trainval/sQNtu4kpd64/50004 WHEREVER OUR DESTINY TAKES US WHETHER IT IS TRANSHUMANISM WHERE THE BODY FUSES WITH NON
trainval/SQwRsVyk7us/50001 WELL FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE I AM A MAKER
trainval/SQwRsVyk7us/50002 THE OBJECTS WE USE THE CLOTHES WE WEAR THE HOUSES WE LIVE IN ALL HAVE A PROFOUND
trainval/SQwRsVyk7us/50003 SO MANY TIMES AMATEURS NOT EXPERTS HAVE BEEN THE INVENTORS AND IMPROVERS
trainval/SQwRsVyk7us/50004 BUT THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE
trainval/SQwRsVyk7us/50005 BUT NOW THE MAKER COMMUNITY AND THE OPEN SOURCE MODEL ARE BRINGING THIS KIND OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOW
trainval/SQwRsVyk7us/50006 SO THE MORE PEOPLE EXPERIMENT WITH MATERIALS THE MORE RESEARCHERS ARE WILLING TO SHARE
trainval/sR6P5Qdvlnk/50001 THAT'S THE BEST WAY
trainval/sR6P5Qdvlnk/50002 AND YOUR JOURNEY IS SIMPLE IT'S MADE OF STEPS
trainval/SrqmuYvk3iQ/50001 OR IS IT GOING TO BE AN EASY WORLD AND YOU HAVE TO BE DIFFERENT
trainval/SrqmuYvk3iQ/50002 MY COLLEAGUE STEPHEN SUOMI HAS BEEN REARING MONKEYS IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS
trainval/SrqmuYvk3iQ/50003 THESE MONKEYS ALREADY DIDN'T SEE THEIR MOTHER SO THEY HAD A SOCIAL EXPERIENCE
trainval/SrqmuYvk3iQ/50004 WE CAN NOW COMPARE THE MONKEY THAT HAD A MOTHER AND NOT
trainval/SRSJX0qRVSw/50001 NOW I'M A PRETTY TYPICAL 15 YEAR OLD GIRL I LIKE FASHION I SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON MY PHONE AND I HAVE SEEN
trainval/SRSJX0qRVSw/50002 LIKE EVERYONE ELSE I POSSESS BOTH MASCULINE AND FEMININE QUALITIES
trainval/SRSJX0qRVSw/50003 IN 1991 PSYCHOLOGIST MONICA BIERNAT FOUND THAT CHILDREN DO NOT INITIALLY SEE MASCULINITY
trainval/SRSJX0qRVSw/50004 WE'VE INTERNALIZED THESE TRAITS WITH A CONCRETE MALE FEMALE ASSOCIATION ALTHOUGH THE TRAITS AND QUALITIES BELONGING TO
trainval/SRSJX0qRVSw/50005 HE WAS OBSESSED AND WOULD DRESS ONLY IN THIS OUTFIT
trainval/SRSJX0qRVSw/50006 TODAY HE SHUDDERS WITH EMBARRASSMENT WHENEVER WE BRING UP HIS CLOSE ASSOCIATION TO SOMETHING SO
trainval/SRSJX0qRVSw/50007 THIS SOCIAL DOMINANCE OF MASCULINITY IS KNOWN AS HEGEMONIC MASCULINITY
trainval/SRSJX0qRVSw/50008 WE ALLOW AND EVEN ENFORCE A DUALITY OR DOUBLE STANDARD
trainval/SRSJX0qRVSw/50009 MALE LEADERS ARE STRONG POWERFUL AND DECISIVE YET A WOMAN IN THE SAME EXACT POSITION IS CONSIDERED A BITCH
trainval/SRSJX0qRVSw/50010 WE SLUT SHAME GIRLS WHILE ADMIRING A MAN WHO IS A PLAYER
trainval/SRSJX0qRVSw/50011 I SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY ECSTATIC AND SO PROUD OF MY ACHIEVEMENT YET I ONLY FELT PANIC
trainval/SryJK294Psw/50001 WHAT CAN YOU DO WHEN YOU KNOW THAT
trainval/SryJK294Psw/50002 WHEN THESE LAWS WORK TOGETHER THEY BRING ABOUT THE BEAUTIFUL MESSY COMPLEX WORLD WE LIVE IN
trainval/SryJK294Psw/50003 WHEN YOU STOP THE OTHER ONE YOU ONLY STOP THE SHELL THE LIQUID INSIDE IS STILL ROTATING BECAUSE NOTHING'S MADE IT STOP
trainval/SryJK294Psw/50004 THIRDLY IT BRINGS THE INTERESTING PEOPLE TO YOU
trainval/SryJK294Psw/50005 YOU WIN ON ALL FRONTS
trainval/SryJK294Psw/50006 HE WAS WORKING OVERSEAS
trainval/SryJK294Psw/50007 I GOT THIS TEXT MESSAGE BACK FROM HIM A COUPLE OF WEEKS LATER AND IT SAID I'M AT BREAKFAST IN A POSH
trainval/SryJK294Psw/50008 THE DAY WE DROP AN APPLE AND IT GOES UP THEN WE'LL HAVE A DEBATE ABOUT GRAVITY
trainval/SryJK294Psw/50009 YOU CAN BLAME ME IT'S FINE
trainval/SryJK294Psw/50010 THEN I LEFT THE STAGE
trainval/SryJK294Psw/50011 WE SHOULDN'T BE AFRAID TO INVESTIGATE THE PHYSICAL WORLD FOR OURSELVES WITH THE TOOLS AROUND US BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE ACCESS
trainval/SS3qnZrVy9o/50001 SO YOU SEE A BEAR YOUR HEART RATE QUICKENS YOUR PUPILS DILATE YOU FEEL FRIGHTENED YOU RUN VERY VERY
trainval/SS3qnZrVy9o/50002 THE PROBLEM WITH THIS PICTURE IS IT DOESN'T ENTIRELY CAPTURE WHAT AN EMOTION
trainval/SS3qnZrVy9o/50003 I THINK TO BE TRULY EMOTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THOSE WORDS HAVE COME
trainval/SS3qnZrVy9o/50004 IT BEGINS IN A GARRET IN THE LATE 17TH CENTURY IN THE SWISS UNIVERSITY TOWN OF
trainval/SS3qnZrVy9o/50005 AND IT'S ONLY WHEN THEY'RE PREPARING TO RETURN THIS YOUNG MAN HOME SO THAT HE CAN DIE THAT THEY REALIZE WHAT'S
trainval/SS3qnZrVy9o/50007 WAS IT THE INVENTION OF TELEPHONES OR THE EXPANSION OF THE RAILWAYS
trainval/SS3qnZrVy9o/50008 WAS IT PERHAPS THE COMING OF MODERNITY WITH ITS CELEBRATION OF RESTLESSNESS AND TRAVEL AND
trainval/SS3qnZrVy9o/50009 NOW HERE'S A GOOD EXAMPLE OF SPIRITUAL PRACTICES AND GEOGRAPHICAL REALITIES COMBINING TO
trainval/SS3qnZrVy9o/50010 WELL IN 1688 A YOUNG DOCTOR JOHANNES HOFER HEARD OF THIS CASE AND OTHERS LIKE IT AND CHRISTENED
trainval/SS3qnZrVy9o/50011 THE LAST PERSON TO DIE FROM NOSTALGIA WAS AN AMERICAN SOLDIER FIGHTING DURING THE FIRST
trainval/SS6ZojCzNGY/50001 SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM I THINK ABOUT IT IN THREE DIFFERENT STEPS
trainval/SS6ZojCzNGY/50002 AND WE ARE AT 100 CAPACITY RIGHT NOW
trainval/SS6ZojCzNGY/50003 OR WHERE THEY CAN IDENTIFY WHAT THE PROBLEM IS WHY THEY CAN'T BEHAVE
trainval/SS6ZojCzNGY/50004 BUT WE JUST CAN'T THROW AWAY THESE KIDS
trainval/SS6ZojCzNGY/50005 AND WE NEVER KEPT THAT PROMISE
trainval/SS6ZojCzNGY/50006 WE NEED TO DO MORE IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM
trainval/SS6ZojCzNGY/50007 THE STATE OF WASHINGTON HAS A BAN IT'S ILLEGAL TO SPEND A DIME OF STATE MONEY ON HIGHER EDUCATION
trainval/SS6ZojCzNGY/50008 AND 28 OF THE PEOPLE DO THAT WITHIN THREE YEARS
trainval/SS6ZojCzNGY/50009 WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO IDENTIFY WHY WE HAVE THOSE COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES AND RECOGNIZE THAT THEY
trainval/SS6ZojCzNGY/50010 SO WHEN I THINK ABOUT CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM I STEP BACK
trainval/sS9ys09BkGE/50001 BECAUSE OF HIS RESEARCH I TRAVELED THE WORLD A LOT AND I KEPT MOVING SCHOOL AND COUNTRY
trainval/sS9ys09BkGE/50002 AND I CHOSE THE SCIENCES
trainval/sS9ys09BkGE/50003 WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SCALES AND CHORDS AND INTERVALS AND THE CYCLE OF FIFTHS WHAT WE WERE DOING IS MAKING GEOMETRIC SHAPES
trainval/sS9ys09BkGE/50004 WHICH FELT EXTRAORDINARILY CORRECT
trainval/sS9ys09BkGE/50005 SO HOW ABOUT OTHER THINGS
trainval/sS9ys09BkGE/50006 I TOLD YOU I WAS WEIRD
trainval/SSJkV8IzsZA/50001 AND THEY WALKED AWAY FROM THESE IMPACTS UNSCATHED BECAUSE THEIR SPINES HAVE EVOLVED IMPRESSIVE SHOCK ABSORBING
trainval/SSJkV8IzsZA/50002 AND SO IT'S KIND OF NO WONDER GOJO IS AN EARLY ADOPTER OF BIOMIMICRY SINCE AFTER ALL
trainval/SSJkV8IzsZA/50003 ONE OF THE FIRST TASKS THAT I WAS ASSIGNED WHEN I STARTED AT GOJO WAS TO LEAD A BIOMIMICRY
trainval/SSJkV8IzsZA/50004 SUSTAINABILITY IS NOT ABOUT SEEING THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES THAT ARE FACING OUR SOCIETY TODAY
trainval/SSJkV8IzsZA/50005 THE ANSWERS ARE IN ALL OF OUR BACKYARDS
trainval/SSJu0Jy9oSQ/50001 IT IS LIKE RETURNING TO FIND YOUR HOME BURGLED AND RANSACKED
trainval/SSJu0Jy9oSQ/50002 SHE WAS OVERWHELMED WITH FATIGUE
trainval/Ssl0043HgQU/50001 SO WHAT WAS SIXTUS'S DREAM WHAT WAS THE BIG PLAN HERE
trainval/SsnWLZvRNZc/50001 I ACTUALLY RECENTLY WENT TO A TINY TROPICAL ISLAND AND I WAS LYING ON THE BEACH UNDER ONE OF THOSE TREES OF
trainval/SsnWLZvRNZc/50002 THIS EXPERIENCE OPENED MY EYES TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOMETHING
trainval/SsnWLZvRNZc/50003 THIS TO ME IS A FUNDAMENTAL QUALITY OF OUR HUMANITY
trainval/SsnWLZvRNZc/50004 AND WHY QUALITY
trainval/SsnWLZvRNZc/50005 BECAUSE IF WE PASS ON MEDIOCRE EXPERIENCE MEDIOCRE KNOWLEDGE PEOPLE WILL ASK MEDIOCRE
trainval/SsnWLZvRNZc/50006 THEY SAID IT IS THE ACCESS TO THE FRESHEST IDEAS IT IS THE POWERFUL NETWORK OF
trainval/SsnWLZvRNZc/50007 OH MY GOD THAT'S AMAZING
trainval/SsnWLZvRNZc/50008 HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO GET THERE
trainval/SsnWLZvRNZc/50010 I TRAVELED AND WORKED AROUND THE WORLD
trainval/SsnWLZvRNZc/50011 BY A CERTAIN AGE WE SHOULD ACQUIRE THIS AMOUNT OF PHYSICS AND THIS AMOUNT OF GEOGRAPHY BY A CERTAIN AGE
trainval/SsnWLZvRNZc/50012 I TRULY BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE OF US AS WE SIT HERE HAS SOME VALUABLE KNOWLEDGE AND
trainval/SsnWLZvRNZc/50013 THIS KNOWLEDGE I PROMISE YOU TO SOME PEOPLE RIGHT NOW CAN BE SERVING AS A LIFE
trainval/SSogppqBahk/50001 NOW I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE DISAGREEMENT IS REALLY ONE OF SEMANTICS
trainval/SSogppqBahk/50002 AND IT'S NOT JUST WILDLIFE
trainval/SsU5CJRaKP8/50001 WORDS CAN CAUSE PLENTY OF HARM
trainval/SsU5CJRaKP8/50002 ARE WE JUSTIFIED IN DOING SO
trainval/SsU5CJRaKP8/50003 FINALLY IT IS RECOGNIZED THAT SPEECH IS ESSENTIAL TO INDIVIDUAL AUTONOMY AND SELF
trainval/SsU5CJRaKP8/50004 IT MAY INTERFERE WITH THOSE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS THAT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE CHARGED WITH
trainval/SsU5CJRaKP8/50005 BUT THE QUESTION REMAINS
trainval/SsU5CJRaKP8/50006 THERE ARE ESSENTIALLY TWO WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN GIVE GREATER WEIGHT TO THE INTERESTS THAT
trainval/SsU5CJRaKP8/50007 ONE IS TO DEFINE OUT OR TO CARVE OUT EXCEPTIONS FOR TYPES OF SPEECH THAT
trainval/SsU5CJRaKP8/50008 MAY WE CONTINUE TO HONOR THAT PRINCIPLE
trainval/SsU5CJRaKP8/50009 WE MUST PROTECT THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH OF THOSE WHO WOULD DENY THE VERY
trainval/SsU5CJRaKP8/50010 WE MUST PROTECT THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH OF THOSE WHO WOULD REJECT THE VERY CONCEPT
trainval/SSudEBkC4O0/50001 BUT FOR SOME REASON I'VE SEEN THE DISAPPEARANCE OF YOUTH CLUBS AND THE EVAPORATION OF THE CLEAR SERVICE CONNECTIONS
trainval/SSudEBkC4O0/50002 THESE AFOREMENTIONED FACTORS ARE CREATING A MELTING POT THAT IS BUBBLING OVER
trainval/SSudEBkC4O0/50003 I HOPE YOU ENJOY
trainval/SSudEBkC4O0/50004 BY DOING SO WE HOPE TO ELEVATE THEIR CAREER PROSPECTS BUT ALSO HELP THEM DEVELOP THEIR OWN BUSINESS IDEAS AS WELL
trainval/SSudEBkC4O0/50005 I'M GETTING THERE
trainval/SSudEBkC4O0/50006 I'M CREATING AN EVENT SERIES CALLED ART AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND THE MAIN AIM OF THIS IS TO SHOWCASE SOME OF THE EXCELLENT TALENT WE HAVE IN
trainval/SSudEBkC4O0/50007 BUT MY BIGGEST THANK YOU HAS TO GO TO THE ARTISTS
trainval/SSV07QKguBI/50001 THAT S ALL IT IS
trainval/SSV07QKguBI/50002 WHY WOULDN'T WE START TO THINK ABOUT
trainval/SSV07QKguBI/50003 WHETHER LIKE MYSELF IT'S A PARTIAL BLINDNESS OR A SIGHT IMPAIRMENT MAYBE HEARING LOSS
trainval/SSV07QKguBI/50005 BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED WHEN I GOT MY LETTER INVITING ME FOR MY
trainval/sSXv06gUX3Y/50001 IT IS THE BEST STORAGE DEVICE IN NATURE
trainval/sSXv06gUX3Y/50002 CANCER STAGE THREE
trainval/sSXv06gUX3Y/50003 THEY COMPLETELY CHANGED THEIR LIFESTYLE AND DIET
trainval/sSXv06gUX3Y/50004 AT THAT MOMENT I REALIZED THAT PLANTS HOLD GREAT MEDICINAL POWER
trainval/sSXv06gUX3Y/50005 WHY WOULD ANYONE DO THAT
trainval/sSXv06gUX3Y/50006 THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE
trainval/sSXv06gUX3Y/50007 WE CAN'T IMPACT WHAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND
trainval/SSy6CJLMuiw/50001 SO I TRIED AN EXPERIMENT
trainval/SSZG5aPkZyM/50001 VERY RECENTLY A WOMAN WALKED UP TO ME FRANTIC
trainval/SSZG5aPkZyM/50002 AS I MOTIONED IN THE DIRECTION I THOUGHT SHE SHOULD GO SAYING THERE ARE NO STORES ON THIS SIDE OF THE STREET SO YOUR
trainval/SSZG5aPkZyM/50003 WHO'S DISABLED NOW
trainval/ST4JS67J0Y4/50002 MY MOTHER'S THERE MY BROTHER'S THERE
trainval/ST4JS67J0Y4/50003 I GREW UP IN A SMALL TOWN
trainval/ST4JS67J0Y4/50005 IT WAS KIND OF THE BABY STEPS OF A FICTION WRITER
trainval/ST4JS67J0Y4/50006 IT WAS A LOT OF FANTASY A LOT OF MY DESIRES
trainval/ST4JS67J0Y4/50007 IT MAY HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS BUT I HADN'T COME OUT YET TO MY FAMILY
trainval/ST4JS67J0Y4/50009 DID YOU READ IT
trainval/ST4JS67J0Y4/50011 I LOOK AT MY BROTHER
trainval/ST4JS67J0Y4/50012 DID YOU READ IT
trainval/ST4JS67J0Y4/50013 HE'S A VERY MACHO GUY
trainval/ST4JS67J0Y4/50014 I FELT BETRAYED BY MY FAMILY
trainval/ST4JS67J0Y4/50015 WHEN I GOT OUT I TOOK AN OVERDOSE
trainval/ST4JS67J0Y4/50016 EVENTUALLY I GOT OUT
trainval/ST4JS67J0Y4/50017 AND I STARTED WRITING ABOUT MY FAMILY AS A WAY TO GET BACK TO MY FAMILY
trainval/ST4JS67J0Y4/50018 AND PEOPLE ASK ME WAS THIS A CATHARTIC EXPERIENCE WRITING THIS NOVEL
trainval/ST4JS67J0Y4/50020 I HAD TO VISIT THE TRAUMA AGAIN I HAD TO GO BACK AND THINK ABOUT MY
trainval/ST4JS67J0Y4/50021 I HAD TO UNDERSTAND THAT MY PARENTS LOVED ME
trainval/St7SxHszKws/50001 JUST BY ASKING THAT SIMPLE QUESTION OF WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE A MAN
trainval/St7SxHszKws/50002 I AM FINE I AM WITHIN THAT CONCEPT
trainval/St7SxHszKws/50003 I WAS KIND OF CAUGHT IN LIMBO
trainval/St7SxHszKws/50004 HOW DO WE DISRUPT THIS
trainval/stAstsOxLPc/50002 AND WHERE ARE WE
trainval/stAstsOxLPc/50003 WE HAVE THE FASTEST GROWING CITY IN THE UNITED STATES WHEN IT COMES TO METROPOLITAN AREAS
trainval/stAstsOxLPc/50004 THEY'VE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB
trainval/stAstsOxLPc/50005 I SERVED SIX YEARS IN THAT JOB
trainval/stAstsOxLPc/50006 YOU CAN'T INNOVATE TOP DOWN
trainval/stAstsOxLPc/50007 PRETTY AMAZING STUFF
trainval/stAstsOxLPc/50008 THESE FOLKS WERE NOT CHASING A GRANT OR MONEY
trainval/stAstsOxLPc/50009 A NEW MODEL FOR INNOVATION
trainval/stAstsOxLPc/50010 I WON'T GO THROUGH THE WHOLE LIST ON THIS
trainval/stAstsOxLPc/50011 MORE AND MORE EDUCATION IS GOING TO BE SELF DIRECTED
trainval/stAstsOxLPc/50012 SAFETY THINK ABOUT THIS ONE
trainval/stAstsOxLPc/50013 THAT'S UP 14 FROM LAST YEAR SAME TIME PERIOD AND WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO HAVING
trainval/stAstsOxLPc/50014 MY DAD HAD A PHRASE NOT ORIGINAL WITH HIM
trainval/stBSQ6CagVo/50001 SO MY FATHER WENT THERE AND HE BOUGHT A WHITE VOLKSWAGEN BEETLE
trainval/stBSQ6CagVo/50002 THAT CARS ARE MEANT TO BE DENTED AND THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST OF MANY DENTS HE WOULD EXPERIENCE IN HIS
trainval/stBSQ6CagVo/50003 THEY TOLD ME STORIES ABOUT THE WHITE VW BUG BUT ALSO STORIES ABOUT THE KOREAN WAR THEY
trainval/stBSQ6CagVo/50004 MY FATHER IS A YOUNG AND AMBITIOUS MAN
trainval/stBSQ6CagVo/50005 WE ROLL OUR EYES AT SOME OF THE EMBARRASSING STORIES THAT GET SHARED OVER AND OVER AND
trainval/stBSQ6CagVo/50006 I'VE SHARED THIS INTERESTING STORY WITH MANY FAMILY MEMBERS AT MANY FAMILY GATHERINGS
trainval/stBSQ6CagVo/50007 THIS WAS MY IDENTITY TO THE WORLD AND THIS WAS MY STORY THE WAY THAT I WANTED TO TELL IT
trainval/stBSQ6CagVo/50008 OF COURSE THE INTERNET HAS EVOLVED AND PROGRESSED QUITE A LOT SINCE THEN AND IT HAS MADE IT
trainval/stBSQ6CagVo/50009 NOW THIS IS A COUNTRY HE HAS LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF
trainval/stBSQ6CagVo/50010 WE CONSUME EACH OTHER'S PHOTOS LINKS AND LIKES
trainval/stBSQ6CagVo/50011 THEY COULD BE BOTH PHYSICAL AND VIRTUAL
trainval/stBSQ6CagVo/50012 THEY COULD BE AS SIMPLE AS SOME TIME SET ASIDE IN THE DAY FOR YOURSELF OR THEY COULD BE FAMILY
trainval/stBSQ6CagVo/50013 FAMILIES NEED PROTECTED SPACES TOO
trainval/stBSQ6CagVo/50014 AND IF I HADN'T CREATED THAT PROTECTED SPACE FOR MY PARENTS TO SHARE THEIR STORIES I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE EVER
trainval/stBSQ6CagVo/50015 THESE ARE STORIES AT THE HEART OF OUR IDENTITIES
trainval/STdSfeMDeI4/50001 I GAVE BIRTH
trainval/STdSfeMDeI4/50002 I KNOW THAT IN ORDER FOR MY BODY TO PRODUCE MILK I HAVE TO BE PREGNANT AND GIVE
trainval/StqRJhHNUGA/50001 AND THE NEXT DAY TYLER JUMPED OFF THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE TO HIS DEATH
trainval/StqRJhHNUGA/50002 AND RATHER IRONICALLY ADULTS THAT CONTROLS DECISION MAKING AND IMPULSE CONTROL
trainval/StqRJhHNUGA/50003 WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT
trainval/StqRJhHNUGA/50004 A SECOND CHANCE TO RECONSIDER THEIR DECISION
trainval/StqRJhHNUGA/50005 I HAD NO IDEA IF KIDS WERE GOING TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY IF IT ACTUALLY HAD ANY KIND OF SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION
trainval/StqRJhHNUGA/50006 I KNEW I HAD TO VALIDATE IT
trainval/StqRJhHNUGA/50007 AND YOU SAY WHAT CAN I DO
trainval/StqRJhHNUGA/50008 YOU'RE TAKING THAT STEP FORWARD FOR EVERY ONE AROUND YOU THAT YOU'RE SUPPORTING
trainval/StqRJhHNUGA/50009 YOU CAN BE YOUR DREAMS AND YOU CAN MAKE YOUR DREAMS HAPPEN
trainval/STsOdmkH5fI/50001 AND I ALWAYS SAY
trainval/STsOdmkH5fI/50002 WHICH I THINK IS WHAT THEY MEAN TOO
trainval/STsOdmkH5fI/50003 I CHOSE TO LIVE IN TORONTO
trainval/STsOdmkH5fI/50004 BUT THE SECOND TIME I HAD A REAL SAY
trainval/STsOdmkH5fI/50005 IF WE CAN'T DO IT WHY DO WE HAVE THE BEST PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM IN THE WORLD RIGHT HERE IN TORONTO
trainval/STsOdmkH5fI/50006 WE BUILT THAT GENERATIONS OF COMMITED TORONTONIANS BUILT THAT PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM
trainval/STsOdmkH5fI/50007 BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY PEOPLE WILL CHOOSE TO GET OUT OF CARS AND ON TO TRANSIT
trainval/STsOdmkH5fI/50008 WHY HAVEN'T WE BUILT RAPID TRANSIT
trainval/STsOdmkH5fI/50009 IN TWO GENERATIONS
trainval/STsOdmkH5fI/50010 AND PEOPLE KEPT UP THAT CONVERSATION
trainval/STsOdmkH5fI/50011 THE FINCH LINE
trainval/STsOdmkH5fI/50012 PEOPLE WHO DESPERATELY NEED RAPID TRANSIT
trainval/STsOdmkH5fI/50013 I'M A PART OF THE CITY
trainval/STsOdmkH5fI/50014 AND WE NEED TO TAKE THAT LANGUAGE BACK BECAUSE WE HAVE A RIGHT TO A GREAT CITY
trainval/Sttw2PxncIE/50001 BUT DESPITE ALL OF MY EFFORT I JUST COULDN'T KEEP THE BALLS IN THE AIR FOR MORE THAN EIGHT
trainval/Sttw2PxncIE/50002 YOU MAY BE ASKING YOURSELF
trainval/STuCsRugKN0/50001 LANGUAGE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOLS CREATED BY HUMAN BEINGS
trainval/STuCsRugKN0/50002 PUTIN HAS GONE ON TO VOW THAT HE WILL PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF RUSSIAN SPEAKERS AROUND THE
trainval/STutVhN7xSs/50001 AND NOW I KNOW THAT I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50001 GEORGETOWN BY PERFORMING THE FIRST EVER DRAG ROUTINE IN GASTON HALL I THINK UNLESS THE JUDGE
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50003 THIS WAS THE OUTFIT
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50004 THAT WAS REAL TAPE
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50005 THOSE WERE REALLY BROKEN GLASSES
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50006 IT WAS AROUND THIS TIME THAT EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T NECESSARILY FEEL ALL THAT DIFFERENT FROM MY PEERS OTHER
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50007 BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO DEVELOP THE VOCABULARY I STARTED TO SEE WHAT IT WAS THAT MADE ME DIFFERENT THAN
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50008 INSTEAD OF EXPENDING HIS CREATIVE ENERGY TO CHANGE HIMSELF AND TO COVER AND TO MEET THE STANDARDS THAT SOCIETY WANTED
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50009 BUT THAT WASN'T QUITE YET ENOUGH FOR ME TO OWN MY OWN IDENTITY
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50010 I HAD TO START WORKING AT A METH LAB
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50011 VERY VERY DIFFERENT THAN ALBUQUERQUE
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50012 SO I'VE HEARD
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50013 A DOZEN WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE BUT
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50014 WHY WOULD I FIGHT
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50015 WHY WOULD I BE OUT AND EVEN IF I HAD ALL THIS HISTORY WHAT GOOD WAS THAT
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50016 WHAT GOOD WAS IT DOING IF I COULD STILL HIDE AWAY
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50017 THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50018 AND SO I UNDERSTOOD THAT BEING OUT WAS NOT IMPORTANT JUST FOR MYSELF IT WAS NOT IMPORTANT JUST BECAUSE OF THE DEBT THAT I OWED TO
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50019 AND SO I MADE SURE THAT IN HIGH SCHOOL WHEN I WAS PUT IN CHARGE OF TEACHING NOVICES I WAS MY OWN JON
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50020 BUSH WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AS AMENABLE TO THE PROJECT ABOUT HOW METH AND GAY SEX COULD CHANGE THE WORLD
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50021 WHERE WAS I GOING TO GO TO COLLEGE AFTER BRONX SCIENCE
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50022 BECAUSE STONEWALL WAS ONE OF THE FIRST INSTANCES IN AMERICAN HISTORY WHERE THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY SAID WE WILL
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50023 UNFORTUNATELY IN 2011 WHEN I WAS GRADUATING IN 2010 WHEN YOU SEARCHED GEORGETOWN
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50024 I CAN'T DEAL WITH THAT AGAIN
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50025 I'M TOO TIRED
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50026 AND I KNEW THAT GEORGETOWN HAD A VERY RICH HISTORY OF LGBTQ ACTIVISM
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50027 WE WOULD RATHER OWN OURSELVES AND USE OUR IDENTITIES TO CHANGE THE SYSTEMS AROUND US
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50028 SO THAT'S WHAT SHE FOCUSED ON
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50029 NOW WE'VE RESTARTED THE COLORS
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50030 I BLAME YOU
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50031 I USE MY CREATIVE ENERGIES TO BEND THE INSTITUTION TO ACCEPT PEOPLE TO ACCEPT IDENTITIES
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50032 IN ITS PUREST FORM WHAT PRIDE AND WHAT THESE STUDENTS WERE DOING WAS SAYING I AM HERE FOR ME
trainval/SU1foLW8h54/50033 NOW OBVIOUSLY I WAS ONLY A SMALL PART OF THIS WORK BUT PART OF VISIBILITY PART OF GEORGETOWN
trainval/sucza6EOIf0/50001 BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY OTHER DOMINICAN PEOPLE HERE BUT I KNOW THAT JUAN ENRIQUEZ HE WAS HERE
trainval/sucza6EOIf0/50002 AND I'M JUST TRYING NOT TO PANIC AND FREAK OUT
trainval/sucza6EOIf0/50003 WELL MY CHARACTERS LIKE THE ONES IN MY SHOWS ALLOW ME TO PLAY WITH THE
trainval/sucza6EOIf0/50004 AND SO I'VE BROUGHT A COUPLE OF THEM WITH ME
trainval/sucza6EOIf0/50005 THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY
trainval/sucza6EOIf0/50006 AH THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/sucza6EOIf0/50007 ANYWAY I AM HERE BECAUSE OF A YOUNG GIRL SARAH JONES
trainval/sucza6EOIf0/50008 BUT I DON'T MIND
trainval/sucza6EOIf0/50009 AND THEN I THOUGHT NO NO
trainval/sucza6EOIf0/50010 AND SHE WAS GETTING A YOGURT IN THE GOOGLE CAFE
trainval/sucza6EOIf0/50011 OH GOLDIE HAWN
trainval/sucza6EOIf0/50012 I LOVE HER TOO SHE'S WONDERFUL
trainval/sucza6EOIf0/50013 YOU KNOW SHE'S ONLY HALF JEWISH
trainval/sucza6EOIf0/50014 I NOTICED IT'S VERY MULTICULTURAL
trainval/sucza6EOIf0/50015 IT'S LIKE A RAINBOW
trainval/sucza6EOIf0/50016 EVEN THOUGH QUITE FRANKLY SOME OF YOUR PRESENTATIONS ARE HORRIFYING ABSOLUTELY HORRIFYING
trainval/sucza6EOIf0/50017 THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU DO
trainval/sucza6EOIf0/50018 AND CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING SUCH BIG MAKHERS THAT YOU'VE BECOME TED
trainval/sucza6EOIf0/50019 AND I JUST I LOVE YOU GUYS
trainval/sucza6EOIf0/50020 AND THEY'VE INSPIRED MANY CHARACTERS AS WELL
trainval/sucza6EOIf0/50021 I MEAN I KNOW SOMETIMES OUR LIFESTYLES ARE VERY DIFFERENT WHATEVER
trainval/sucza6EOIf0/50022 BUT WHEN THEY GOT OLDER WHEN THE TIME COMES FOR THEM TO START THINK ABOUT GETTING MARRIED
trainval/sucza6EOIf0/50023 RIGHT NOW IT'S VERY EXCITING ACTUALLY FOR ME BECAUSE I'M THE JUNIOR ASSISTANT TO THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR UNDER THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR
trainval/sucza6EOIf0/50024 SO IF YOU WILL INDULGE ME I WILL SHARE QUICKLY WITH YOU A BIT OF VERSE WHICH I
trainval/SudRdL19d5w/50001 HIS STYLE ON POINT
trainval/sUf1ajkIAhY/50001 YOU GUYS HAVE TO ACT UP YOU HAVE TO FIGHT THE DISEASE NOT EACH OTHER
trainval/sUf1ajkIAhY/50002 WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THESE LABORATORIES
trainval/sUf1ajkIAhY/50004 ARE THERE MORE DANGEROUS VIRUSES COMING OUT
trainval/sUf1ajkIAhY/50005 WE DIDN'T KNOW
trainval/sUf1ajkIAhY/50006 THAT WAS MY MOMENT OF SEEING WHAT WAS REALLY GOING ON
trainval/sUf1ajkIAhY/50007 DON'T THEY KNOW WHERE THESE BIG PROBLEMS ARE
trainval/sUf1ajkIAhY/50009 WE REALLY WANT THAT INFORMATION
trainval/sUf1ajkIAhY/50010 SCIENCE HAS GROWN
trainval/sUf1ajkIAhY/50011 AND THEN OF COURSE THERE'S A PROBLEM
trainval/sUf1ajkIAhY/50012 HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHO GETS THE MONEY
trainval/sUf1ajkIAhY/50013 WHO'S GETTING THE NOBEL PRIZE
trainval/sUf1ajkIAhY/50014 AND THEY WERE IN THE STREETS YOU CAN SEE IT IN THE SLIDES BEHIND ME SAYING
trainval/sUf1ajkIAhY/50015 BECAUSE THEY NEED THEM TO SURVIVE
trainval/sUf1ajkIAhY/50016 WE'RE SPENDING TOO LITTLE TIME ON QUALITY CONTROL
trainval/sUf1ajkIAhY/50017 WE'RE ALL VERY HASTY WE HAVE LITTLE TIME WE HAVE TO PUBLISH
trainval/sUf1ajkIAhY/50018 WHAT SHOULD WE DO
trainval/sUf1ajkIAhY/50019 AND OF COURSE WE SHOULD REWARD ACADEMICS INVESTIGATORS FOR PICKING UP THE
trainval/sUf1ajkIAhY/50020 THIS IS THE WAY TO SURVIVE IN SCIENCE
trainval/sUf1ajkIAhY/50021 THE GUYS FORM ACT UP REALLY WENT TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH AND WALKED INTO OUR LABORATORIES TO
trainval/SUkVcmKZyyQ/50001 LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION
trainval/SUkVcmKZyyQ/50002 AND POSSIBLY THE COSMOS WE DON'T KNOW
trainval/SUkVcmKZyyQ/50003 WE DIDN'T WE WERE LUCKY
trainval/SUkVcmKZyyQ/50004 WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE OUR LIFESTYLES WE KNOW THAT
trainval/SUkVcmKZyyQ/50005 GO ON LOOK AT EACH OTHER
trainval/SUkVcmKZyyQ/50006 OK HAVE I MADE THE POINT
trainval/SUkVcmKZyyQ/50008 SO THEY WERE THE PRIME THINGS WE WERE DOING
trainval/SUkVcmKZyyQ/50009 SO IF YOU WANT TO CALL US MOTHERHOOD WE'RE PROUD TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH IT
trainval/SUkVcmKZyyQ/50010 AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
trainval/SUkVcmKZyyQ/50011 A WHOLE LOT OF VERY WISE PEOPLE WORKING FOR THE FUTURE
trainval/SV2FB4ZmsTQ/50001 AFTER HOURS OF PRACTICING AROUND MY HOUSE I FINALLY MASTERED THE ART OF SKIPPING
trainval/SV2FB4ZmsTQ/50002 GREAT BUT HOW DOES THIS AFFECT ALL OF YOU
trainval/SV2FB4ZmsTQ/50003 NOW THIS MAY MEAN MISSING OUT ON SOME LEISURELY ACTIVITIES THAT WE ALL LIKE TO DO
trainval/SV2FB4ZmsTQ/50004 BUT I PROMISE YOU THAT YOU WILL LOOK BACK ON YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND REALIZE THAT THESE HAD IMPACTED YOU
trainval/SV2FB4ZmsTQ/50005 FROM A YOUNG AGE I WAS TAUGHT THAT TO SUCCEED IN LIFE YOU HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING YOU LOVE AND FOLLOW THAT DREAM
trainval/SV2FB4ZmsTQ/50006 NOW SKIPPING SEEMS SO EASY
trainval/Sv36Vt9GmH8/50001 BUT AFTER A LITTLE WHILE MY SUBCONSCIOUS DECIDED YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/SVB39Jo8mAQ/50001 TO WHICH THEY'D SAY DAD IT'S FINE
trainval/SVB39Jo8mAQ/50002 SHE WAS THE FIRST ONE BANKRUPTED {LG}
trainval/SVB39Jo8mAQ/50003 IN THE CONFINES OF MY EXPERIMENT THERE IS AN IDEA WORTH SPREADING AND IT IS THIS
trainval/SVB39Jo8mAQ/50004 PETER DRUCKER FAMED LEADERSHIP GURU SAID BANKING AND FINANCE INDUSTRIES TODAY ARE LESS ABOUT MONEY AND MORE ABOUT INFORMATION
trainval/SVB39Jo8mAQ/50005 MY 9 YEAR OLD SON IS ALWAYS THE CAR A VERY STRATEGIC PLAYER
trainval/SVB39Jo8mAQ/50006 YOU'RE LAUGHING BECAUSE IT'S TRUE
trainval/SVB39Jo8mAQ/50008 BUT WHAT SNAPPED ME BACK TO REALITY WAS HEARING MY SON BEHIND ME SAY I SURE WISH I HAD A PHONE SO I COULD
trainval/SVB39Jo8mAQ/50009 AND IN MY SIMPLISTIC VIEW IT IS THIS
trainval/SVB39Jo8mAQ/50010 I MET AN AMERICAN NAMED JOS
trainval/SVB39Jo8mAQ/50011 I RESENTED MY PARENTS FOR A YEAR
trainval/SVB39Jo8mAQ/50013 I REALISED IT WAS THE SINGLE BEST THING THEY COULD HAVE EVER DONE FOR ME
trainval/SVB39Jo8mAQ/50014 IN FACT IF EVER YOU'RE IN A LINE AND SOMEONE IN FRONT PULLS OUT THEIR CHEQUEBOOK TO PAY YOU ARE LIABLE TO SAY TO
trainval/SvBggxCNNno/50001 BUT LET ME FIRST ELABORATE JUST A LITTLE BIT ON A BASIC PRINCIPLE BEHIND EACH SEARCH QUERY THAT WE SOMETIMES SEEM TO
trainval/SvBggxCNNno/50002 SO WHENEVER YOU SET OUT TO GOOGLE SOMETHING START BY ASKING YOURSELF THIS AM I LOOKING FOR AN ISOLATED FACT
trainval/SvBggxCNNno/50003 GREAT GOOGLE AWAY
trainval/SvBggxCNNno/50004 YOU DON'T SEE A BIG CONSPIRACY AMONG THOSE THINGS
trainval/SvBggxCNNno/50005 WE AGREE ON A GLOBAL SCALE WHAT THE ANSWERS ARE TO THESE ISOLATED FACTS
trainval/SvBggxCNNno/50006 WHY IS GOOGLE THE SEARCH ENGINE OF CHOICE FOR YOU
trainval/SvBggxCNNno/50007 AND THIS IS WHERE IT BECOMES INTERESTING BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE WE BECOME HUMAN
trainval/SvBggxCNNno/50008 THIS IS WHEN WE START TO ARGUE TO FORM SOCIETY
trainval/SvBggxCNNno/50009 STRANGELY ENOUGH I ALWAYS GET THE SAME THREE ANSWERS
trainval/SvBggxCNNno/50010 THERE WAS A PICTURE DISTRIBUTED WIDELY OVER THE INTERNET WHERE HER FACE WAS DISTORTED TO LOOK LIKE A MONKEY
trainval/SvBggxCNNno/50011 JPEG OR THE LIKE
trainval/SvBggxCNNno/50012 HOWEVER GOOGLE DIDN'T SETTLE FOR THAT THIS TIME THEY JUST THOUGHT THAT'S RACIST AND IT'S A BAD SEARCH RESULT AND WE'RE
trainval/SvBggxCNNno/50013 AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE IN THIS ROOM THINKS THAT WAS A BAD IDEA
trainval/SvBggxCNNno/50014 IT'S NOT TRUE
trainval/SvBggxCNNno/50015 AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST THIRDLY INEVITABLY ONE STUDENT WILL RAISE HER OR HIS HAND AND SAY
trainval/SvBggxCNNno/50016 LET'S TEACH GOOGLE THAT THAT'S THE FACE OF THE TERRORIST
trainval/SvBggxCNNno/50017 AND MY MESSAGE GOES OUT NOT ONLY TO GOOGLE BUT TO ALL BELIEVERS IN THE FAITH OF CODE AROUND THE WORLD
trainval/SvBggxCNNno/50018 AND IF NOTHING ELSE TO REMIND US THAT THAT WONDERFULLY SEDUCTIVE IDEA OF THE UNBIASED CLEAN SEARCH RESULT
trainval/SvBggxCNNno/50019 WE BELIEVE IN YOU WE DON'T BELIEVE IN YOU
trainval/SvBggxCNNno/50020 YOU'RE RIGHT YOU'RE WRONG
trainval/svIPBU31d0c/50001 THAT IS UNFAIR BUT THAT IS THE REALITY
trainval/svNcoU59IQ0/50001 I MEAN IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED SYSTEM
trainval/svNcoU59IQ0/50002 SOMEONE MUST CONTROL ALL OF THIS
trainval/svNcoU59IQ0/50003 NO ONE IS IN CHARGE
trainval/svNcoU59IQ0/50005 YOU REALLY REDUCE CONGESTION QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY
trainval/svNcoU59IQ0/50006 BUT WELL AS I SAID I MEAN CAR DRIVERS ADAPT RIGHT
trainval/svNcoU59IQ0/50007 AND WHY IS THAT
trainval/svNcoU59IQ0/50008 IT'S BECAUSE THAT TRAVEL PATTERNS ARE MUCH LESS STABLE THAN YOU MIGHT THINK
trainval/svNcoU59IQ0/50009 EACH DAY PEOPLE MAKE NEW DECISIONS AND PEOPLE CHANGE AND THE WORLD CHANGES AROUND THEM AND EACH DAY ALL OF
trainval/Svo01ldlTQc/50002 OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY WORKING THE WHOLE TIME
trainval/Svo01ldlTQc/50003 BUYING MESQUITE CHARCOAL WILL NOT ACTUALLY MAKE THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE
trainval/Svo01ldlTQc/50004 AND IT'S A WONDERFUL THING
trainval/Svo01ldlTQc/50005 BUT NOW YOU WILL WE PUT A BIOGRAPHY OF JAMES WATT IN
trainval/Svo01ldlTQc/50006 IT TURNED OUT HE WAS HIRED BY A SCOTTISH DISTILLERY TO UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WERE BURNING SO DAMN MUCH PEAT TO DISTILL THE
trainval/Svo01ldlTQc/50007 THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE WATER INSIDE THAT POPCORN
trainval/Svo01ldlTQc/50008 SO IT'S A GREAT ILLUSTRATION OF THAT
trainval/Svo01ldlTQc/50009 WE HAVE A CHAPTER ON GELS
trainval/SvSSb7cJn2A/50001 SO I'M NOW ON A MISSION TO HELP ORGANIZATIONS SOLVE THEIR WICKED PROBLEMS BY
trainval/SvZXgApsPCQ/50003 I SAW DEAD PEOPLE
trainval/SvZXgApsPCQ/50004 IN FACT HE INVITED ME TO EXPLAIN MYSELF
trainval/SvZXgApsPCQ/50006 I DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT
trainval/SvZXgApsPCQ/50007 THAT'S ONE VERSION
trainval/SvZXgApsPCQ/50008 OK I CAN BUILD A BETTER COMPANY
trainval/SvZXgApsPCQ/50009 I SEARCHED HOW DO I OVERCOME THE FEAR OF REJECTION
trainval/SvZXgApsPCQ/50011 HE SAID WOW I CAN USE THIS
trainval/SvZXgApsPCQ/50012 WHY DON'T YOU COME BACK IN TWO MONTHS
trainval/SvZXgApsPCQ/50013 AND IN THAT PICTURE WHICH YOU CAN'T SEE I QUOTED MARTIN LUTHER KING JR
trainval/SvZXgApsPCQ/50014 THESE PEOPLE DID NOT LET REJECTION DEFINE THEM
trainval/SvZXgApsPCQ/50015 I USE MY BLOG I USE MY TALK I USE THE BOOK I JUST PUBLISHED AND I'M EVEN BUILDING
trainval/SvZXgApsPCQ/50016 I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE IT
trainval/SvZXgApsPCQ/50017 WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO DO WAS LEARN AND TO CHANGE MYSELF
trainval/SvZXgApsPCQ/50018 BUT BEFORE HE COULD LEAVE I SAID HEY CAN I KNOW WHY
trainval/SvZXgApsPCQ/50019 I DON'T WANT TO WASTE YOUR FLOWER
trainval/SvZXgApsPCQ/50020 IF YOU WANT TO DO THIS GO ACROSS THE STREET AND TALK TO CONNIE
trainval/SvZXgApsPCQ/50021 I WENT ACROSS AND KNOCKED ON CONNIE'S DOOR
trainval/SvZXgApsPCQ/50023 IT'S AS IF HE'S PUTTING ALL THE DOUBT ON THE FLOOR
trainval/SvZXgApsPCQ/50024 SO FOR THE NEXT HOUR I WAS THE STARBUCKS GREETER
trainval/SvZXgApsPCQ/50025 I SAID HI TO EVERY CUSTOMER THAT WALKED IN AND GAVE THEM HOLIDAY CHEERS
trainval/SvZXgApsPCQ/50026 AND THEN I LEARNED I COULD FULFILL MY LIFE DREAM
trainval/SvZXgApsPCQ/50027 HE WAS LIKE NO ONE HAS DONE THIS BEFORE
trainval/SwaBFUgSoT8/50001 I WROTE ALL THROUGH CHILDHOOD ALL THROUGH ADOLESCENCE BY THE TIME I WAS A TEENAGER I WAS SENDING MY VERY BAD STORIES TO THE NEW
trainval/SwaBFUgSoT8/50002 AND THAT'S HOW I PUSHED THROUGH IT
trainval/SwaBFUgSoT8/50003 YOU GOT SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT WHOLE EAT PRAY LOVE' THING THAT'S BEEN GOING ON LATELY
trainval/SwaBFUgSoT8/50004 AND IT WAS ONLY WHEN I WAS TRYING TO UNTHREAD THAT THAT I FINALLY BEGAN TO COMPREHEND THE STRANGE AND UNLIKELY
trainval/SwaBFUgSoT8/50005 SO THAT MIGHT BE CREATIVITY IT MIGHT BE FAMILY IT MIGHT BE INVENTION ADVENTURE FAITH SERVICE IT MIGHT BE RAISING
trainval/SwaBFUgSoT8/50006 ACTUALLY I KIND OF FELT BULLETPROOF BECAUSE I KNEW THAT I HAD BROKEN THE SPELL AND I HAD FOUND MY WAY BACK HOME TO
trainval/swI68y2oQ60/50001 I RECENTLY FINISHED MY PH
trainval/swI68y2oQ60/50002 IN THE DEPTHS OF MY STUDIES OF PHILOSOPHY I LEARNED A SIMPLE TRUTH ABOUT JUSTICE AND SOME POWERFUL MIND
trainval/swI68y2oQ60/50003 IT'S AN ONGOING FIGHT
trainval/swI68y2oQ60/50004 SO THIS IS CERTAINLY A PARTIAL LIST
trainval/swI68y2oQ60/50005 KEEP IN MIND THESE ARE ORGANISMS WHO ARE MUCH SMALLER
trainval/swI68y2oQ60/50006 SO TO GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF PRODUCT YOU HAVE TO CONFINE A WHOLE LOT MORE OF THEM AND KILL AND HARM A LOT MORE OF THEM
trainval/swI68y2oQ60/50007 NOW 95 OF THE LAND ANIMALS RAISED FOR FOOD IN THE UNITED STATES ARE
trainval/swI68y2oQ60/50008 AND SUPPOSE THAT YOU MET A VETERINARIAN OR FOUND OUT ABOUT ONE THAT WAS TREATING DOGS OR CATS IN ANY ONE OF THESE
trainval/SwiaaqKdtjw/50001 ARCHITECTS DISLIKE AIRCONDITIONING IN FACT
trainval/SwiaaqKdtjw/50002 COULD WE LEARN FROM THEM AND BUILD A BUILDING IN REALITY
trainval/SwiaaqKdtjw/50005 EARTH WIND AND FIRE
trainval/SwiaaqKdtjw/50007 IT'S AMAZING THAT YOU CAN MAKE A CFD SIMULATION OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WATER
trainval/SwiaaqKdtjw/50008 AND IT TURNS OUT THAT WE HAVE A RELIABLE COMPUTER MODEL FOR THAT
trainval/SwiaaqKdtjw/50009 WILL PEOPLE LIKE NATURAL AIR CONDITIONING
trainval/SwiaaqKdtjw/50010 WELL MOST PROBABLY YES
trainval/SwiaaqKdtjw/50011 THAT CAN BE DONE
trainval/SwiaaqKdtjw/50012 AND ALSO FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BUILDING YOU CAN CALL IT A SOCIAL INNOVATION BECAUSE THE INDOOR
trainval/SWjSKTraw7c/50001 YOU'RE GOING TO DESICCATE OUT THERE
trainval/SWjSKTraw7c/50002 I LOVE TO STUDY THESE ANIMALS THAT BREAK THE RULES BECAUSE EVERY TIME THEY BREAK A RULE THEY INVENT SOMETHING NEW
trainval/SWjSKTraw7c/50003 THEY BREAK THE RULES
trainval/SwMTKRixZIE/50001 I MET TRACY IN JUNE OF 2011 WHEN THE TODAY SHOW ASKED ME IF
trainval/SwMTKRixZIE/50002 I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED WITH TRACY IN A LITTLE BIT BUT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU A DISCOVERY THAT I MADE WHEN I WAS
trainval/SwMTKRixZIE/50003 AND THAT'S EVEN IF YOUR SENSE OF SELF HAS DIMINISHED OVER TIME AS HAPPENS WITH SO MANY OF US THE
trainval/SwMTKRixZIE/50004 WE DID THAT ALREADY
trainval/SwMTKRixZIE/50005 WE HAVE FEWER SPOUSAL OR PARTNER JOB RELOCATIONS
trainval/SwMTKRixZIE/50006 WE'RE IN A MORE SETTLED TIME OF LIFE
trainval/SwMTKRixZIE/50007 WE HAVE A MORE MATURE PERSPECTIVE
trainval/SwMTKRixZIE/50008 WE'RE NOT TRYING TO FIND OURSELVES AT AN EMPLOYER'S EXPENSE
trainval/SwMTKRixZIE/50009 I HAD DONE MY FINANCIAL ANALYSIS SO LONG AGO THAT I USED LOTUS 1 2
trainval/SwMTKRixZIE/50010 AND THEY DO
trainval/SwMTKRixZIE/50011 THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE HAVE COME
trainval/SwMTKRixZIE/50012 IN FACT AN EMPLOYER JUST TOLD ME THAT THEIR VETERANS RETURN TO WORK PROGRAM IS BASED ON THEIR
trainval/SwMTKRixZIE/50013 SO EVEN THOUGH SHE HAD A SECOND JOB OFFER AT ANOTHER COMPANY FOR A PERMANENT FULL TIME ROLE SHE DECIDED TO
trainval/SwMTKRixZIE/50014 BUT IN THE MEANTIME IF YOU ARE RETURNING TO WORK AFTER A CAREER BREAK DON'T
trainval/SwMTKRixZIE/50015 BECAUSE THE INTERNSHIP ALLOWS THE EMPLOYER TO BASE THEIR HIRING DECISION ON AN ACTUAL
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50001 I WALKED INTO THE CLASSROOM AND THEY ISSUED ME A CADAVER
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50002 AS THEY DID EVERYONE ELSE IN THE CLASS
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50003 AND THE CADAVER I HAD CAME WITH A MEDICAL HISTORY THE PROFESSOR TOLD US IN ORDER TO
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50004 SO I NAMED MINE CHARLIE
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50005 THE HEART WAS SURROUNDED BY FAT SEVERAL INCHES
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50006 ONE OF THE TRICKS OUR INSTRUCTORS TAUGHT US WAS YOU KNOW WE HAD TO THROUGH THESE LABS WHERE WE HAD TO NAME WHAT
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50007 IF YOU PULL ON A VEIN IT'S LIKE A GUITAR STRING AND IT'LL TWANG
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50008 I'M THINKING OF MAKING IT A CAREER
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50009 WHEN I PULLED ON CHARLIE'S ARTERIES AND VEINS THEY BROKE OFF INTO MY HAND
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50010 THEY THEN SENT ME TO BE THE COMMANDER OF INITIAL MILITARY TRAINING
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50011 AND THAT WAS
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50012 ONE MINUTE OF PUSH UPS ONE MINUTE OF SIT UPS AND A ONE MILE RUN
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50013 NOW THAT'S NOT A DIFFICULT TEST
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50014 BUT WE WERE FINDING THAT A GREAT MAJORITY OF OUR NEW SOLDIERS COMING OFF THE CIVILIAN ENVIRONMENT COULD NOT
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50015 WELL WE'RE GETTING THE PRODUCT OF THAT BUT IN ADDITION TO SECOND AND THIRD ORDER EFFECTS WERE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WERE JOINING
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50016 YOU COULDN'T JUST GET A 16 OZ DRINK YOU COULD GET A 24 42 64 OZ SODA
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50017 AND THAT WAS HAVING A DELETERIOUS EFFECT
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50018 BUT THE COMBINATION OF A LACK OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND AN INCREASE OF POOR
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50019 SO IN TYPICAL ARMY FASHION I SAID WE'VE GOT TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES WITH OUR NEW RECRUITS
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50020 AND WE CHANGED SEVERAL THINGS
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50021 THIS IS WHAT NFL MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL THEY KNOW THEY'VE GOT TO EAT RIGHT IN ORDER TO PERFORM AT THEIR MAXIMUM
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50022 WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR WE SAW SOME UNBELIEVABLY STRONG STATISTICS THAT SHOWS THIS WAS WORKING
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50023 SO MY CONCERN IS
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50024 FOR ME THIS WAS AN ECONOMIC ISSUE
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50025 WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE OTHER 99
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50026 WE'RE SEEING AN INCREASE IN DIABETES
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50027 WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL HAVE A 40 CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RATE BY THE YEAR 2030
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50029 AN ECONOMIC ISSUE
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50030 THE THIRD REASON WE SAW WAS AN INCREASE IN TECHNOLOGY
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50031 THERE ARE SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE ATTEMPTING TO APPROACH THIS
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50032 YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF MAYOR BLOOMBERG IN NEW YORK WHO HAS BANNED ALL
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50033 AND THE COUNTER OBESITY MEASURES
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50034 NOW I'M A BIG FAN OF TECHNOLOGY BUT THE RESEARCHERS HAD TOLD ME THAT WE NOW WATCH AS A NATION ABOUT
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50035 THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN PUT A YELLOW RIBBON ON AND SAY LET SOMEBODY ELSE TAKE CARE OF IT
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50036 BE FEARLESS IN TERMS OF WRITING YOUR SCHOOLS
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50037 BE FEARLESS IN TRYING TO GET NUTRITION BACK IN RESTAURANTS
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50038 BE FEARLESS IN BALANCING YOUR LIVES AND GETTING OUT TO EXERCISE
trainval/sWN13pKVp9s/50039 THAT'S FIVE HOURS A DAY
trainval/sWnAtLt8kSs/50001 THEN I STARTED TO NOTICE A WEIRD PHENOMENON
trainval/SwT0YLKbwoU/50001 WE MAKE FIRE WE PLAY GAMES WE GO FOR EXPERIENCES SOMEWHERE OR WHAT ELSE WE BELIEVE WOULD BE FUN DOING
trainval/Sx1qkuvUxuI/50001 IT'S SO MYSTERIOUS AND IT'S SO PERVASIVE
trainval/Sx1qkuvUxuI/50002 WE KNOW BABIES SUFFER FROM JEALOUSY
trainval/Sx1qkuvUxuI/50003 WE FORGET HOW HARSH HIS VISION WAS
trainval/Sx1qkuvUxuI/50004 I DON'T KNOW
trainval/Sx1qkuvUxuI/50005 BECAUSE HE'S NOT LOOKING AT WHAT HIS WIFE IS DOING
trainval/Sx1qkuvUxuI/50006 IT SEEMS TO TREAT JEALOUSY AS A PROBLEM OF GEOMETRY NOT EMOTION
trainval/Sx4Gsh0r9HU/50001 BECAUSE IN THE STREETS IS WHERE THERE'S HISTORY OF LOCATIONS THEMSELVES AND THE ABILITY FOR YOU TO CAPTURE
trainval/Sx4Gsh0r9HU/50002 PRETTY MUCH PUTTING YOURSELF INTO THE GENESIS OF THAT LOCATION'S TIMELINE
trainval/Sx4Gsh0r9HU/50003 THIS IS WHEN WE'RE FILMING AND PEOPLE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO SAY AS THE FILMING'S HAPPENING BUT THEY APPROACH US AFTERWARDS AND ASK
trainval/Sx4Gsh0r9HU/50004 WHY ARE WE DOING THIS
trainval/Sx4Gsh0r9HU/50005 AND THE FIRST THING HE ASKED THEM IS DO YOU SPEAK HEBREW
trainval/Sx4Gsh0r9HU/50006 WHEN YOU WATCH HER POWER MOVE
trainval/Sx4Gsh0r9HU/50007 LIKE THAT IS DONE AND WE HAVE TO DELETE OUR FOOTAGE
trainval/Sx4Gsh0r9HU/50008 WHAT I ASSUMED WHEN I WATCHED THE POLICEMAN WALK UP IS THAT YOU KNOW I WAS IN TROUBLE OR SOMETHING BUT HE WASN'T THINKING
trainval/Sx4Gsh0r9HU/50009 WHY FILM DANCE IN THE STREETS
trainval/SXJ20tt5nPQ/50001 IF YOU HAVE AN INFECTION GO TO A DOCTOR
trainval/SXJ20tt5nPQ/50002 WESTERN MEDICINE CAN'T TOUCH THOSE
trainval/SXJ20tt5nPQ/50003 USING AUTOMATIC WEAPONS TO SLAUGHTER UNCONTACTED PEOPLES IS THE
trainval/SXJ20tt5nPQ/50004 THEY KNOW WE EXIST THEY KNOW THERE'S AN OUTSIDE WORLD
trainval/SXOZflB1BKo/50001 IT WAS INCREDIBLE
trainval/SXOZflB1BKo/50002 BUT MY RULE HAS ALWAYS BEEN
trainval/SxPeQda00Co/50001 AND THEN THERE WAS MY OTHER STUFF
trainval/SxPeQda00Co/50002 IT WAS ALMOST LIKE MY PAST BECAME PROLOGUE AND SLOWLY CHANGED WHAT I HAD COME TO
trainval/SxPeQda00Co/50003 AND OF COURSE IT ALL COMES BACK TO A BOY
trainval/SxPeQda00Co/50004 WHY DID I FEEL LIKE I HAVE DONE SOMETHING WRONG
trainval/SxPeQda00Co/50005 AFTER THE BREAKUP I NEEDED THAT SAME SENSE OF CONTROL AGAIN SO I DID WHAT CAME NATURALLY
trainval/SxPeQda00Co/50006 I COMPARTMENTALIZED AND I STUFFED MY EMOTIONS BACK INTO THAT MESSY BOX
trainval/SxPeQda00Co/50007 BUT THAT'S JUST THE FRONT FACING PART OF MY STORY
trainval/SxPeQda00Co/50008 THE BRAND OF TRAUMA I EXPERIENCED WAS SEXUAL ABUSE AT THE HANDS OF MY STEPFATHER
trainval/SXYwKxdxfF8/50001 SIX MONTHS LATER SHE DROPS OUT AGAIN
trainval/SXYwKxdxfF8/50002 THIS TIME THIS REST TAKES UP TO FOUR MONTHS
trainval/SXYwKxdxfF8/50003 LET ME ASK YOU SOME PERSONAL QUESTIONS
trainval/SXYwKxdxfF8/50004 WHICH ONE OF YOU IS IN A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP
trainval/SXYwKxdxfF8/50005 EVENTUALLY SHE OPENED UP SHE TOLD US ABOUT HER ADDICTED SON
trainval/SXYwKxdxfF8/50006 SO THAT'S WHAT WE DID
trainval/SY78HMlWo6k/50001 THIS LED ME TO COMMIT A VIOLENT CRIME WHICH CATEGORIZED ME AS A VIOLENT OFFENDER
trainval/SY78HMlWo6k/50002 BUT I'M NOT A VIOLENT PERSON BY NATURE
trainval/SY78HMlWo6k/50003 BECAUSE OUR BEHAVIOR IS A BIG FACTOR IN WHO WE ARE WOULDN'T YOU AGREE
trainval/SY78HMlWo6k/50004 BUT HOW MANY OF US ARE WILLING TO GIVE SECOND CHANCES
trainval/SY78HMlWo6k/50005 THEY EMIGRATE TO THE UNITED STATES AND SETTLE IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA
trainval/Syi9bqfFIdY/50001 THESE ARE STARS BEING BORN OUT OF HERE
trainval/Syi9bqfFIdY/50002 AND AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS WE'RE CONTINUING TO MUTATE
trainval/Syi9bqfFIdY/50003 THAT WAS PARTLY BASED ON FRANCIS GALTON'S WORK
trainval/Syi9bqfFIdY/50004 HE WAS DARWIN'S COUSIN
trainval/Syi9bqfFIdY/50005 BUT WHAT'S BEGINNING TO HAPPEN IS BECAUSE THESE GEEKS ARE ALL GETTING TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY ARE HIGHLY QUALIFIED FOR
trainval/SyIgLSfLCww/50001 WORKING TO CREATE VIBRANT DIVERSE AND HARMONIOUS COMMUNITIES
trainval/SyIgLSfLCww/50002 PEOPLE WHO HAD STARTED THE DAY AS STRANGERS WERE BY THE END OF IT SHARING MUTUAL
trainval/SyIgLSfLCww/50003 IMAGINE BEING IN A SPACE LIKE THAT YOURSELF
trainval/SyIgLSfLCww/50004 A CONSTRUAL BEING HOW WE PERCEIVE THE WORLD AROUND US AND CRUCIALLY HOW WE PERCEIVE PEOPLE'S BEHAVIORS
trainval/SyjbDUP1o0g/50001 AND THAT NUMBER HASN'T REALLY CHANGED IN RECENT YEARS
trainval/SyjbDUP1o0g/50002 THEY ARE MAKING LOTS OF DISTINCTIONS ALL THE TIME
trainval/SyjbDUP1o0g/50003 IN FACT WE ARE NOT REALLY VERY GOOD LETTING THEM WALK TO SCHOOL ANYMORE BY THEMSELVES EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE FEWER
trainval/syjEN3peCJw/50001 YOU SEE THAT GLASS OF WATER
trainval/syjEN3peCJw/50002 FOURTEEN MINUTES IS NOT ENOUGH TIME TO FULLY CREDIT THOSE GOOD AND GENEROUS PEOPLE WHO FOUGHT WITH ME AND
trainval/syjEN3peCJw/50003 AND MENACING SO IN THIS RESPECT A VITAL FIRST STEP WAS LEARNING TO SEPARATE OUT A METAPHORICAL MEANING FROM
trainval/syjEN3peCJw/50004 AND TO BE HONEST SOMETIMES I QUITE ENJOYED THEIR ATTENTION AS WELL
trainval/syjEN3peCJw/50005 NOW AT FIRST I WOULD HAVE BELIEVED THEM
trainval/sYOS4qOHxdg/50001 NOTHING GOT BETTER
trainval/sYOS4qOHxdg/50002 AND I'VE DONE OVER 70 INVESTIGATIONS LIKE THIS WITH MY CO HOST ROSS
trainval/sYOS4qOHxdg/50003 DO YOU AGREE WITH IT
trainval/sYOS4qOHxdg/50004 THE PERSON SAYS YES
trainval/sYOS4qOHxdg/50005 WE USE THESE THINGS AS STOPGAPS FOR THINGS THAT WE CAN'T EXPLAIN
trainval/SYpHNImNsx8/50001 WHAT DO YOU WANT HER TO DO
trainval/SYpHNImNsx8/50002 DICK WAS IMPRISONED FOR RAPING HIS 12 YEAR OLD STEPDAUGHTER AND HE WAS
trainval/SYpHNImNsx8/50003 LET'S GO BACK TO DETAILS
trainval/SYpHNImNsx8/50004 THE FIRST AGE OF USING PORNOGRAPHY IS 12
trainval/SYpHNImNsx8/50005 BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/SYpHNImNsx8/50006 MY SON IS WORTH BETTER THAN THIS
trainval/SYpHNImNsx8/50008 AND YOU KNOW WHY
trainval/SYpHNImNsx8/50009 WHEN YOU THINK THAT PORN IS THE MAJOR FORM OF SEX ED THINK WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE NEXT
trainval/SypPoKpQi6w/50001 IT'S CLEAR THAT WE NEED BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND THIS
trainval/sYUjyH8Y0No/50001 AND SO SHE SET ABOUT TO MAKE IT SO
trainval/sYUjyH8Y0No/50002 THAT WAS NOT MY INTENTION
trainval/sYUjyH8Y0No/50003 AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU I WASN'T THAT HOPEFUL BECAUSE I'D SEEN THE ESTABLISHMENT
trainval/sYUjyH8Y0No/50004 I THOUGHT IT ALWAYS STICKS TOGETHER
trainval/sYUjyH8Y0No/50005 WHAT THEY HADN'T COUNTED ON WAS DIGITIZATION BECAUSE THAT MEANT THAT ALL THOSE PAPER RECEIPTS HAD BEEN
trainval/sYUjyH8Y0No/50006 IT'S THIS DEMOCRATIZATION OF INFORMATION THAT I THINK IS AN INFORMATION ENLIGHTENMENT AND IT HAS MANY OF THE SAME
trainval/sYUjyH8Y0No/50007 THAT'S WHY WE'RE STARTING TO SEE MORE DISCLOSURE LAWS COME OUT SO FOR EXAMPLE ON THE ENVIRONMENT THERE'S THE AARHUS CONVENTION
trainval/sYUjyH8Y0No/50008 IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT
trainval/sYUjyH8Y0No/50009 IT WAS AMAZING
trainval/sYUjyH8Y0No/50010 I MEAN IT WAS AMAZING
trainval/sYUjyH8Y0No/50011 DO YOU KNOW THE ONE I MEAN
trainval/sYUjyH8Y0No/50012 THEY ALL BITCHED ABOUT EACH OTHER
trainval/sYUjyH8Y0No/50013 THEY DON'T HAVE SPECIAL POWERS
trainval/sYUjyH8Y0No/50014 THEY'RE NOT MAGIC
trainval/sYUjyH8Y0No/50016 HE WASN'T CONTENT WITH THE WAY THE NEWSPAPERS PUBLISHED IT TO BE SAFE AND LEGAL
trainval/sYUjyH8Y0No/50017 HE THREW IT ALL OUT THERE
trainval/sYUjyH8Y0No/50018 THAT DID END UP WITH VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN AFGHANISTAN BEING EXPOSED
trainval/sYUjyH8Y0No/50019 SKEPTICISM BECAUSE YOU MUST ALWAYS BE CHALLENGING
trainval/sYUjyH8Y0No/50020 I WANT TO SEE THE EVIDENCE BEHIND WHY THAT'S SO
trainval/sYUjyH8Y0No/50021 WE HAVE AN OFFICIAL SECRETS ACT WITH NO PUBLIC INTEREST TEST
trainval/sYUjyH8Y0No/50022 TAKE IT ON FAITH
trainval/sYUjyH8Y0No/50023 YOU'VE GOT DRONES NOW BEING CONSIDERED FOR DOMESTIC SURVEILLANCE
trainval/sYUjyH8Y0No/50024 I MEAN THERE DEFINITELY IS PROGRESS ON THE LINE BUT I THINK WHAT WE FIND IS THAT THE CLOSER THAT WE GET RIGHT
trainval/SYwvyjIDk80/50001 I MEAN WHAT DOES SOMEBODY WITH ALL THESE OUTFITS BRING WITH HER
trainval/SYwvyjIDk80/50002 JUST BE WHO YOU ARE
trainval/SYwvyjIDk80/50003 AND IF YOU DON'T THINK YOU LOOK GOOD IN SOMETHING YOU'RE ALSO PROBABLY RIGHT
trainval/SYwvyjIDk80/50004 I GREW UP WITH A MOM WHO TAUGHT ME THIS DAY IN AND DAY OUT
trainval/SYwvyjIDk80/50005 AND I'M GOING TO BREAK IT DOWN FOR YOU FOR JUST A SECOND
trainval/sYySLEdYr8A/50001 BUT RATHER THAN TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY ABOUT THESE TWO MOVEMENTS I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU FOUR
trainval/sYySLEdYr8A/50002 IN ONE HIGHLY VIEWED EPISODE A SOAP OPERA LEAD ACTRESS WAS KILLED BY A STRAY BULLET
trainval/sz77x05rySc/50001 AND HE TRIED TO PERSUADE ME TO WRITE THE BROWSER FOR IT BECAUSE HIS SYSTEM DIDN'T HAVE ANY GRAPHICS OR FONTS OR LAYOUT OR ANYTHING IT
trainval/sz77x05rySc/50002 SO THAT PUTS ME IN PRETTY ILLUSTRIOUS COMPANY
trainval/SZbNyp1jeGo/50001 SOMETIMES WE HIRE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE LANGUAGES BUT OFTEN WE TRAIN
trainval/SZSc5UCSZS0/50002 BUT HE WOULDN'T STOP
trainval/SZSc5UCSZS0/50003 I WAS FIGHTING THAT PROCESS
trainval/SZSc5UCSZS0/50004 AND I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE SOMETHING WITH YOU IN CLOSING
trainval/SZSc5UCSZS0/50005 FOUR YEARS OLD DE RIHYA
trainval/SZSvyLHi2us/50001 THEY GET UP JUST A LITTLE BIT LATER EVERY DAY SAY 15 MINUTES OR SO AND THEY KIND OF DRIFT ALL THE WAY
trainval/SZSvyLHi2us/50002 AND SO IN THIS WAY WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE WORKING ON THEIR OWN INTERNAL CLOCKS RATHER THAN SOMEHOW SENSING THE DAY OUTSIDE
trainval/SZSvyLHi2us/50003 AND IN BETWEEN THEY HAVE A COUPLE OF HOURS OF SORT OF MEDITATIVE QUIET IN BED
trainval/szU2S1infqc/50001 DID YOU EVER STOP TO THINK ABOUT HOW THOSE ITEMS OF INVENTORY ACTUALLY FOUND THEIR WAY INSIDE THAT BOX IN THE
trainval/szU2S1infqc/50002 AND SAY LABOR IS CHEAP LAND IS CHEAP
trainval/szU2S1infqc/50003 WE'LL PUT THEM ON MOBILE SHELVING
trainval/szU2S1infqc/50004 AND SO WE GOT UNDERWAY ON THAT AND THEN I'M SITTING ON MY COUCH IN 2008
trainval/szU2S1infqc/50005 IF THE WORKER IN STATION 3 DECIDES TO LEAVE AND GO TO THE BATHROOM IT HAS NO IMPACT ON THE PRODUCTIVITY OF
trainval/SZWS8SNCKMw/50001 99 SPY ON YOUR EX GIRLFRIEND SOFTWARE ONLINE
trainval/SZWS8SNCKMw/50002 IT'S REALLY TERRIFYING
trainval/t0pwKzTRG5E/50001 THIS IS WHAT I SPOKE ABOUT IN THE LAST TED
trainval/t0pwKzTRG5E/50002 IT'S ALMOST AS THOUGH IT'S PERFORMING A VIRTUAL REALITY SIMULATION OF THE OTHER PERSON'S ACTION
trainval/t0pwKzTRG5E/50003 FOR ONE THING THEY MUST BE INVOLVED IN THINGS LIKE IMITATION AND EMULATION
trainval/t0pwKzTRG5E/50005 DARWINIAN EVOLUTION IS SLOW IT TAKES HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS
trainval/t0pwKzTRG5E/50006 A POLAR BEAR TO EVOLVE A COAT WILL TAKE THOUSANDS OF GENERATIONS MAYBE 100000 YEARS
trainval/t1owaS144N4/50001 YOU VIBRATE WITH THE UNKNOWN
trainval/t1owaS144N4/50002 NOW I LEARNED HOW NOT TO VIBRATE WITH THE UNKNOWN AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A SECOND
trainval/t1owaS144N4/50003 I BELIEVE IN YOU
trainval/t1owaS144N4/50004 IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY THING
trainval/t1owaS144N4/50005 I WAS AUDITIONING FOR SOMETHING ABOUT 25 YEARS AGO AND I WAS WALKING DOWN THIS HALL AND I WAS STANDING WITH A
trainval/t1owaS144N4/50006 I THANK YOU
trainval/t1owaS144N4/50007 THAT'S A BIG BUZZWORD RIGHT NOW
trainval/t1sYh9itUvs/50001 DO YOU NOTICE ONE THING ON THERE THAT ISN'T CHANGING
trainval/t1sYh9itUvs/50002 HE CAN'T BREAK THE WINDOWS
trainval/t1sYh9itUvs/50003 THE NEIGHBOR CALLS THE POLICE THE POLICE CALL THE AMBULANCE THEY GET HIM OUT THE CAR
trainval/t1sYh9itUvs/50005 OF THAT 4 IS REMEMBERED POSITIVELY 7 IS REMEMBERED NEGATIVELY 89 ISN'T
trainval/t1sYh9itUvs/50006 1000 ADVERTISING MESSAGES A DAY YOU'RE EXPOSED TO
trainval/t1sYh9itUvs/50007 WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE MEDIA OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE DOING
trainval/t1sYh9itUvs/50008 IF WE LEARN HOW THAT WORKS
trainval/t1sYh9itUvs/50009 WHERE WAS THE PRINTING PRESS
trainval/t1sYh9itUvs/50011 BE A BIT MORE DOG
trainval/t1sYh9itUvs/50012 I DON'T KNOW
trainval/t1sYh9itUvs/50014 EVERYTHING ELSE WILL FALL INTO PLACE
trainval/t1ZSoufuQg4/50001 AND NO MATTER WHAT I SAY YOU CANNOT UNTIE ME FROM THE MAST
trainval/t1ZSoufuQg4/50003 IT'S PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE TO EXERCISE MORE
trainval/t1ZSoufuQg4/50004 I MEAN LET'S FACE IT THE PRESENT SELF IS PRESENT
trainval/t1ZSoufuQg4/50005 IT'S IN CONTROL
trainval/t1ZSoufuQg4/50006 BECAUSE IT'S NOT THAT EASY TO GET RID OF FIVE DOLLARS
trainval/t1ZSoufuQg4/50007 I'M TALKING ABOUT THE TOPIC OF SAVING
trainval/t1ZSoufuQg4/50008 NOW SAVING IS A CLASSIC TWO SELVES PROBLEM
trainval/t1ZSoufuQg4/50009 THE PRESENT SELF DOES NOT WANT TO SAVE AT ALL
trainval/t1ZSoufuQg4/50010 IT WANTS TO CONSUME
trainval/T22s4jCZ4Ho/50001 THIS WAS INCONTROVERTIBLE PROOF THAT THE EARTH WAS NOT THE CENTER OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM WHICH WAS EFFECTIVELY
trainval/T22s4jCZ4Ho/50002 THIS BLASTOCYST IS AN AMAZINGLY COMPLICATED STRUCTURE
trainval/T22s4jCZ4Ho/50003 BRIAN THIS MIGHT BE THE ULTIMATE COSMIC WILD GOOSE CHASE BUT WE SHOULD DO IT
trainval/T22s4jCZ4Ho/50004 AND WE DID DO IT
trainval/t2FrJOGKWxY/50001 IT WAS ONE OF THOSE OLD METALLIC CASES WITH THE GLASS FRONT THE BLACK PERFORATED BACKGROUND THAT YOU WOULD
trainval/t2FrJOGKWxY/50002 SHOULD I SHOULDN'T I
trainval/t2FrJOGKWxY/50003 IS IT HELPING ME LEARN
trainval/T2jwSUhu7ok/50002 I'M A POLITICAL SOCIOLOGIST
trainval/T2jwSUhu7ok/50003 AND I DO RESEARCH ON VOTING BEHAVIOUR
trainval/T2jwSUhu7ok/50004 I FOUNDED AND DIRECT THE CALIFORNIA CIVIC ENGAGEMENT PROJECT HERE AT UC DAVIS
trainval/T2jwSUhu7ok/50005 WHAT DO YOU THINK THE ELIGIBLE TURNOUT RATE WAS FOR 18 TO 24 YEAR OLDS LAST NOVEMBER HERE IN
trainval/T2jwSUhu7ok/50006 WHAT PERCENTAGE ACTUALLY VOTED
trainval/T2jwSUhu7ok/50008 NOW OF COURSE THERE ARE ISSUES THAT OVERLAP ACROSS AGE GROUPS THAT OLDER AND YOUNGER VOTERS AGREE ON
trainval/T2jwSUhu7ok/50009 YOUNG PEOPLE ARE HIGHLY MOBILE
trainval/T2jwSUhu7ok/50010 THEY DON'T REACH OUT TO THEM IN ANY GIVEN ELECTION
trainval/T2jwSUhu7ok/50011 AND WE HAVE MANY NEGATIVE ATTITUDES ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE AND VOTING
trainval/T2jwSUhu7ok/50012 I WAS RAISED HERE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN CALIFORNIA
trainval/T2jwSUhu7ok/50013 WE GAVE YOUNG PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO VOTE 18 YEAR OLDS IN 1971 BUT THEN WE SYSTEMATICALLY DEFUNDED THEIR
trainval/T2jwSUhu7ok/50014 YOU CAN ALSO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES
trainval/T33vGEPLSwg/50001 I HAD ALL OF THOSE THINGS
trainval/T33vGEPLSwg/50002 SO I HAD THIS WEIRD MIXTURE OF VALUES WHICH WERE BASICALLY LIKE I NEED TO KEEP HOLD OF EVERYTHING I HAVE BUT EQUALLY I NEED TO
trainval/T33vGEPLSwg/50004 HOW WHY AND WHERE IT WENT TO WAS OF LESS IMPORTANCE TO ME
trainval/T33vGEPLSwg/50005 ALTHOUGH OBVIOUSLY I MADE SURE THAT I COULD DONATE OR RECYCLE AS MUCH AS I COULD THE ESSENCE WAS ABOUT IT LEAVING MY
trainval/T33vGEPLSwg/50006 ONE OF THE THINGS I DID WAS SET MYSELF CHALLENGES
trainval/T33vGEPLSwg/50007 THAT HELPED ME TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE RUTHLESS WHEN I WAS GOING THROUGH THINGS
trainval/T33vGEPLSwg/50008 ACTUALLY I CAN REMEMBER MORE OF THE THINGS I'VE GIVEN AWAY THAN THE THINGS THAT I'VE KEPT SO FOR ME THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT
trainval/T33vGEPLSwg/50009 THE THIRD THING IS
trainval/T33vGEPLSwg/50010 I DIDN'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THINGS
trainval/T33vGEPLSwg/50011 BUT WHAT I DIDN'T REALLY DO IS THINK ABOUT THE DAY TO DAY THINGS THE THINGS I BROUGHT INTO MY HOUSE OR TOOK OUT OF MY HOUSE ALL THE
trainval/T33vGEPLSwg/50012 SO IT STARTED ME THINKING ABOUT A PROJECT TO GET RID OF 1000 THINGS
trainval/T3I6LwDSfPE/50001 AND FOR ME SPACE IS THAT WHITE AREA LEFT ON THAT MAP IT'S THE PLACE WE STILL HAVE
trainval/t4kyRyKyOpo/50001 NOW PROGRAMMING FOR THOSE OF YOU HERE THAT HAVEN'T DONE IT YOURSELF REQUIRES LAYING OUT IN
trainval/t4kyRyKyOpo/50002 FOR EXAMPLE THESE FOUR ALGORITHMS WERE ALL BUILT BY THE SAME GUY
trainval/T4SvurUIYI8/50001 WE LEARNED ABOUT PEARL HARBOR AND D DAY
trainval/T4SvurUIYI8/50002 BUT THERE IS ANOTHER WAY OF LEARNING ABOUT HISTORY AND IT HAS TO DO WITH LOOKING AT THE SMALL
trainval/T4SvurUIYI8/50003 EVERY EPISODE WENT THE SAME WAY PRETTY MUCH
trainval/T4SvurUIYI8/50004 YOU'RE SO WISE
trainval/T4SvurUIYI8/50005 THAT CONCEPT OF FATHER KNOWS BEST HAS A LONG HISTORY
trainval/T4SvurUIYI8/50006 THE ROMANS TALKED ABOUT THE FATHER OF THE FAMILY PATER
trainval/T4SvurUIYI8/50007 AT A FAMILY GATHERING SHE HAD COME HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL AND WAS TELLING US THAT WHEN SHE WENT TO SEE HER
trainval/T4SvurUIYI8/50008 WHEN THE SUPREME COURT MADE ITS JUDGMENT THEY SIDED WITH THE HOSPITAL AND THE STATE OF MISSOURI
trainval/T4SvurUIYI8/50009 AND THEY PRESENTED THE EVIDENCE TO THE COURT IN MISSOURI AND THE COURT AGREED THAT THIS WAS
trainval/T4SvurUIYI8/50010 WHICH THEY DID
trainval/T4SvurUIYI8/50011 SO WE LEARNED ABOUT THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
trainval/T4SvurUIYI8/50012 WE LEARNED ABOUT THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION
trainval/T4SvurUIYI8/50013 WE ALL KNOW THAT SMOKING IS BAD BUT IT WAS BACK IN THE 50S WHEN DOCTORS AND
trainval/T4SvurUIYI8/50014 I CAME ACROSS SOME STATISTICS
trainval/T4SvurUIYI8/50015 IN 1815 THE AVERAGE AMERICAN ATE ABOUT 5 POUNDS OF SUGAR IN A YEAR
trainval/T4SvurUIYI8/50016 BY THE WAY NOT EVERYONE STOPPED SMOKING
trainval/T4SvurUIYI8/50017 IT'S GOING TO BE THE SAME FOR US WITH REGARD TO MEAT AND DAIRY PRODUCTS
trainval/T4SvurUIYI8/50018 WE KNOW BEST
trainval/T4SvurUIYI8/50019 WE OWE IT TO OURSELVES
trainval/T4SvurUIYI8/50020 WE OWE IT TO OUR FAMILIES
trainval/t4tNALubJTA/50001 OVER AND OVER AGAIN DAY AFTER DAY LIKE REAL RESPONSIBLE GROWN UP ADULT
trainval/t4tNALubJTA/50002 PEOPLE DON'T CARE IF IS YOU OR THE NEXT PERSON THEY JUST WANT IT DONE
trainval/t4tNALubJTA/50003 AND REVIEWERS WANTED ME TO COMMENT ON IDEAS THAT WERE IMPORTANT TO ME
trainval/t5dSmG8SI34/50001 AND WHAT FAITH FELT LIKE
trainval/t5dSmG8SI34/50002 PRAISE THE BECOMING
trainval/t5dSmG8SI34/50004 PRAISE YOUR RESURRECTION
trainval/t5dSmG8SI34/50005 PRAISE YOUR MOUTH
trainval/t5KNNlxLScc/50001 AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW
trainval/t5KNNlxLScc/50002 AND I AM GOING TO TRY RIGHT NOW
trainval/t5KNNlxLScc/50003 WELL WE CAN SIMPLY BET ON IT
trainval/t5KNNlxLScc/50005 AND I THOUGHT OH MY GOD I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT I HAD REPLIED TO THAT ONE
trainval/T7ibjISKSdY/50001 I ALREADY WEAR GLASSES
trainval/T7ibjISKSdY/50002 THEY WERE ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT AFRICA CAN BRING TO THE WORLD
trainval/T7ibjISKSdY/50003 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/T7ibjISKSdY/50004 FOR EXAMPLE IN OUR DOCUMENTARY WE TALK ABOUT SCIENCE AND DEVELOPMENT BUT WE USE
trainval/T8VS0LUCgmk/50001 WE HAD A NICE HOUSE
trainval/T8VS0LUCgmk/50002 WHY THIS FEAR OF AUTISM
trainval/T8VS0LUCgmk/50003 ACCEPTANCE IS PROACTIVE
trainval/t9c7aheZxls/50001 AND THEY PROSPERED DOING THAT
trainval/t9c7aheZxls/50002 AND MEANWHILE OUR TRACK RECORD OF GETTING TO MARS IS LOUSY
trainval/t9c7aheZxls/50003 WE AND THE RUSSIANS THE EUROPEANS THE JAPANESE THE CHINESE AND THE INDIANS HAVE ACTUALLY SENT 44
trainval/t9c7aheZxls/50004 OR WE MAY GET THERE A LONG TIME BEFORE NASA BUT NASA HAS TAKEN A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY IN FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN
trainval/t9c7aheZxls/50005 IN FACT IF ONLY THE WATER ICE AT THE POLES ON MARS MELTED MOST OF THE PLANET WOULD BE UNDER
trainval/t9c7aheZxls/50006 SOMEBODY'S GOING TO BUILD AN IRON FOUNDRY
trainval/t9c7aheZxls/50007 WHEN THAT HAPPENED PEOPLE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND SAID IF WE CAN DO THIS WE CAN DO ANYTHING
trainval/t9EuJ9QlikY/50001 UP UNTIL THAT POINT I GREW UP ON A FARM BUT I HADN'T REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT
trainval/t9EuJ9QlikY/50002 THE SECOND IS THE SIZE
trainval/t9EuJ9QlikY/50003 IS IT A SINGLE SERVING SIZE
trainval/t9EuJ9QlikY/50004 THAT IS THE COLOR
trainval/t9EuJ9QlikY/50005 PEOPLE GENERALLY DON'T LIKE A YELLOW PLUM
trainval/T9vLHFza8Uc/50001 I WAS COMPLETELY IMMERSED IN THE RAT RACE TO ENDLESS SELF IMPROVEMENT
trainval/T9vLHFza8Uc/50002 YOU COULD SAY I WAS PRACTICALLY ADDICTED TO IT
trainval/T9vLHFza8Uc/50003 A SELF HELP BOOK ON PUBLIC SPEAKING
trainval/T9vLHFza8Uc/50004 SECOND THING I LEARNED
trainval/T9vLHFza8Uc/50005 WHAT ABOUT MESSI
trainval/T9vLHFza8Uc/50006 AND INSTEAD OF SPENDING TIME WITH MY WIFE I STILL CHECKED MY E MAILS EVERY TWO
trainval/T9vLHFza8Uc/50007 SO I KNEW EXACTLY HOW TO BECOME HAPPY BUT I FAILED TO LIVE BY THESE INSIGHTS
trainval/T9vLHFza8Uc/50008 AND THIS RITUAL HAS HELPED ME TO SEE THAT
trainval/T9vLHFza8Uc/50009 IT COULD BE PRACTICING GRATITUDE LIKE I DO
trainval/T9vLHFza8Uc/50010 OF COURSE NOT
trainval/T9vLHFza8Uc/50011 HERE IS A RITUAL THAT WORKS FOR ME
trainval/ta9jdCcqWiA/50001 CAN YOU TELL ME HOW YOU CAME INTO THE FAMILY
trainval/ta9jdCcqWiA/50002 ONE COUPLE EXPLAINED THEIR INSEMINATION BY TAKING THEIR CHILDREN TO A FARM
trainval/ta9jdCcqWiA/50003 SO IT IS DIY
trainval/ta9jdCcqWiA/50004 THEY HOPED THAT THEIR CHILDREN WOULD UNDERSTAND THEIR REASONS FOR MAKING THE FAMILY IN THIS WAY
trainval/ta9jdCcqWiA/50005 WE WILL SAY NO YOU DO NOT HAVE A DAD
trainval/ta9jdCcqWiA/50006 AND THAT'S THE STRANGE THING ABOUT ADVICE
trainval/ta9jdCcqWiA/50007 WE DO TESTS WE DO FOLLOW UP STUDIES
trainval/ta9jdCcqWiA/50008 WORK WITH ADVICE THAT WORKS FOR YOUR FAMILY
trainval/tAcQfn96yFk/50001 WHAT I FOUND OVER TIME THOUGH WAS THAT MY ROLE THE PHYSICAL DUTIES I DID
trainval/tAcQfn96yFk/50002 IF I DIDN'T TRY TO INCORPORATE THEM I TOO WOULD REGRET THAT
trainval/tAcQfn96yFk/50003 IF WE CAN LOOK AT DEATH AND REALIZE WE ARE GOING TO DIE
trainval/tAcQfn96yFk/50004 SOME OF US WON'T BE HERE IN A YEAR'S TIME
trainval/tAcQfn96yFk/50005 IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING SELFISH
trainval/tAcQfn96yFk/50006 ON A DAILY BASIS ON A MOMENT TO MOMENT BASIS
trainval/tAcQfn96yFk/50007 I WANT TO HONOR WHERE MY HEART IS LEADING ME
trainval/tAcQfn96yFk/50008 WE CAN LOOK BACK AT MISTAKES WE'VE MADE
trainval/tAcQfn96yFk/50009 TODAY FOR EXAMPLE I SPENT 15 MINUTES JUST LYING ON THE AUTUMN LEAVES OVER IN THE
trainval/tAReayFqUEY/50001 TRADITIONAL PRESCRIPTIONS FOR GROWTH IN AFRICA ARE NOT WORKING VERY WELL
trainval/tAReayFqUEY/50003 THE PAN AFRICAN OPPORTUNITIES OUTWEIGH THE CHALLENGES AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE EXPANDING STAWI'S MARKETS FROM
trainval/tAReayFqUEY/50004 BUT FOR THE PROBLEMS WE FACE IN AFRICA WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT THE MARSHALL PLAN TO REVITALIZE WAR TORN EUROPE IT
trainval/tBbyP0P7BRg/50001 SURE I'D HEARD THINGS ABOUT THE HOMELESS
trainval/tBbyP0P7BRg/50002 THINGS LIKE THEY WERE LAZY THEY'RE DRUNKS WHY DON'T THEY JUST GET A JOB
trainval/tBbyP0P7BRg/50003 I HAD BEEN CAST OFF FROM SOCIETY
trainval/tBbyP0P7BRg/50004 GOT IN TROUBLE
trainval/tBbyP0P7BRg/50005 JUST DIDN'T REALLY CARE
trainval/tBbyP0P7BRg/50006 BUT OVER TIME I REALIZED THAT HELPING SOMEONE GET TO THAT AHA MOMENT FOR THEM TO REALIZE
trainval/tBbyP0P7BRg/50007 SO I PUT IN AN APPLICATION
trainval/tBbyP0P7BRg/50008 I HAD AN INTERVIEW AND I GOT THE JOB
trainval/tBbyP0P7BRg/50009 EVERY DAY THAT I WENT TO WORK I WAS HELPING SOMEONE HAVE ACCESS TO MATERIALS THAT THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE OTHERWISE HAD
trainval/tBbyP0P7BRg/50010 MY FAMILY WAS WALKING THOUGH BALBOA PARK IN SAN DIEGO CALIFORNIA AND I SAW A MAN SLEEPING ON A BENCH
trainval/tBbyP0P7BRg/50011 HIS CLOTHES WERE DIRTY AND TATTERED AND EVEN THOUGH IT WAS WARM HE WAS WEARING MANY LAYERS OF CLOTHING
trainval/tbicAmaXYtM/50001 THEY WERE REELING FROM THE EARTHQUAKE THEY WERE REELING FROM CHOLERA THAT WAS BROUGHT IN BY UN PEACEKEEPERS
trainval/tbicAmaXYtM/50002 IT IS A TOOL TO REIMAGINE A WORLD WHERE BLACK PEOPLE ARE
trainval/tbicAmaXYtM/50003 AND THE CLOSER TO BLACK THAT YOU ARE ON THAT SPECTRUM THE WORSE OFF YOUR ARE
trainval/tbicAmaXYtM/50004 WE HAVE TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS AT THE ROOT AND WHEN YOU DEAL WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING IN BLACK
trainval/tbicAmaXYtM/50005 WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE WAGE GAP WE OFTEN SAY WOMEN MAKE 78 CENTS TO EVERY
trainval/tbicAmaXYtM/50006 YOU ALL HAVE HEARD THAT BEFORE
trainval/tbicAmaXYtM/50007 THE REALITY IS THAT BLACK WOMEN MAKE SOMETHING LIKE 64 CENTS TO EVERY 78 CENTS
trainval/tbicAmaXYtM/50008 IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT COMING AND WATCHING PEOPLE ON A STAGE RIGHT
trainval/tbicAmaXYtM/50009 IT'S ABOUT HOW DO YOU BECOME THAT LEADER WHETHER IT'S IN YOUR WORKPLACE WHETHER IT'S IN YOUR HOME AND
trainval/tbicAmaXYtM/50010 THEY WERE ABLE TO LAUNCH NEW PROGRAMS FUNDRAISE
trainval/tbicAmaXYtM/50011 AND WHEN I CAME BACK
trainval/tbicAmaXYtM/50012 I HAD TO GIVE THEM A LOT OF GRATITUDE AND PRAISE BECAUSE THEY SHOWED ME
trainval/tbicAmaXYtM/50013 AND IN ORDER FOR US TO GET TO THAT POINT I THINK THERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING
trainval/tbicAmaXYtM/50014 AND THERE'S A WAY IN WHICH WE'VE BEEN KIND OF TRANSFORMED INTO CELEBRITIES RATHER THAN
trainval/tbicAmaXYtM/50015 AND THE WAY THAT WE TREAT CELEBRITIES IS VERY FICKLE RIGHT
trainval/tbicAmaXYtM/50016 WE LIKE THEM ONE DAY WE DON'T LIKE WHAT THEY'RE WEARING THE NEXT DAY AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE HAVE ISSUES RIGHT
trainval/tbicAmaXYtM/50017 WE CAN HAVE DISAGREEMENTS WITHOUT BEING DISAGREEABLE BUT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US
trainval/tbicAmaXYtM/50018 IT'S HAPPENING TO ME I KNOW THAT'S RIGHT
trainval/tbicAmaXYtM/50019 BUT I'M SO INSPIRED WHEN I SEE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A WAY THAT THEY DO THINGS HAVE A WAY THAT
trainval/tbicAmaXYtM/50020 I'M INSPIRED BY SEEING OLDER PEOPLE STEP INTO THEIR OWN POWER AND LEADERSHIP AND SAY I'M
trainval/tbicAmaXYtM/50021 ONE CALL THE WHITE HOUSE
trainval/tbicAmaXYtM/50022 AND THAT IS INTRICATELY RELATED TO BLACK LIVES
trainval/tbicAmaXYtM/50023 BE A PART OF SOMETHING
trainval/tbicAmaXYtM/50024 GET INVOLVED DON'T SIT ON YOUR COUCH AND TELL PEOPLE WHAT YOU THINK THEY SHOULD BE DOING
trainval/tbRM4Q6OI8A/50001 I WAS REALLY NERVOUS OBVIOUSLY
trainval/tbRM4Q6OI8A/50002 LET'S MAKE OUR UNIFORMS PINK
trainval/tbRM4Q6OI8A/50004 THE PHENOMENA STARTED AGAIN
trainval/tbRM4Q6OI8A/50005 MEN WERE SEEING SOMETHING DIFFERENT WERE SEEING A PINK CAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RACING TRACK
trainval/tbRM4Q6OI8A/50006 I WAS LUCKY TO FIND MANY GIRLS IN DIFFERENT SCHOOLS THAT CONTINUE HELPING ME MANAGE THE PROJECT AND I
trainval/tbRM4Q6OI8A/50007 THAT IS TRUE
trainval/TcBrchkBSBE/50001 I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHAT THE FUTURE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION LOOKS LIKE
trainval/TcBrchkBSBE/50002 IT TAKES DOZENS OF YEARS IF AT ALL UNTIL THE NEW SUBWAY LINE GETS THERE
trainval/TcBrchkBSBE/50003 EVEN THE ONGOING OPERATING EXPENSES OF MOST OF THE WORLD'S PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
trainval/TcBrchkBSBE/50004 WHY THE BUS CAN'T ADAPT TO WHAT YOU NEED
trainval/TcBrchkBSBE/50005 AGAIN WE CAN'T MOVE
trainval/td1PbsV6B80/50001 DADDY'S GOT YOU
trainval/td1PbsV6B80/50002 THAT'S ALL THAT'S IMPORTANT
trainval/td1PbsV6B80/50003 NOW I EXPECTED HIM TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE I'D BE SAD I'D BE MAD I'D BE ANGRY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
trainval/td1PbsV6B80/50004 AT THIS TIME WE'RE LIVING IN THE BRONX AND IN THE BUILDING NEXT TO WHERE I LIVED THERE WAS A GUY NAMED JOHNNY
trainval/td1PbsV6B80/50005 AND HE WAS HANGING OUT WITH ALL US YOUNGER GUYS
trainval/td1PbsV6B80/50006 AND THIS GUY HE WAS UP TO A LOT OF NO GOOD
trainval/td1PbsV6B80/50007 AND HE DID SPEND A LOT OF TIME UP TO NO GOOD
trainval/td1PbsV6B80/50008 WE KIND OF SEE OURSELVES SEPARATE BUT WE'RE VERY MUCH A PART OF IT
trainval/Td2hfdXQ5x8/50001 AND SO WE DECIDED TO TAKE THIS CASE TO THE SUPREME COURT
trainval/td5Ld3nURAI/50001 THEY FLOAT FREELY IN THREE DIMENSIONS WITHOUT ANY FORCES ACTING ON THEM
trainval/td5Ld3nURAI/50002 AND AS THEY LAND THEY'RE FULLY ALIGNED IN THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD
trainval/td5Ld3nURAI/50003 THAT'S WHY YOU'RE ALL IN YOUR CHAIRS
trainval/td5Ld3nURAI/50004 WE'LL SEE TWO CELLS IN THE UPPER PART OF THE SCREEN
trainval/td5Ld3nURAI/50005 THERE'S NOW A NEW RESEARCH PROJECT UNDERWAY AT THE KAROLINSKA IN SWEDEN TO PROVE THAT HYPOTHESIS
trainval/TdBAHexVYzc/50002 WE CAN THINK OF OLDER GENOME ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGIES AS SIMILAR TO
trainval/TdBAHexVYzc/50003 PART OF THE CRISPR SYSTEM IS A PROTEIN CALLED CAS9 THAT'S ABLE TO SEEK OUT
trainval/TdBAHexVYzc/50004 WE ALSO WANT TO UNDERSTAND BETTER HOW TO CONTROL THE WAY THAT DNA IS REPAIRED AFTER IT'S CUT
trainval/TdBAHexVYzc/50005 AND ACTUALLY THERE IS AN IMPORTANT PRECEDENT FOR SUCH A PAUSE FROM THE 1970S WHEN SCIENTISTS
trainval/TdBAHexVYzc/50006 IT'S INTERESTING THAT AS I TALK TO PEOPLE MY SCIENTIFIC COLLEAGUES AS WELL AS OTHERS THERE'S A WIDE VARIETY OF
trainval/TdBAHexVYzc/50007 BUT I DO THINK THAT BEING INVOLVED IN THE GENESIS OF THIS REALLY PUTS ME AND MY COLLEAGUES IN A
trainval/TDCYJ3Sgx2w/50001 OR IF IT GETS TOO HOT YOUR THERMOSTAT REGISTERS TURN THE A
trainval/TDCYJ3Sgx2w/50002 AND SO BY COLLECTING THIS DATA YOU CAN FIND OUT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR THYROID
trainval/TDCYJ3Sgx2w/50003 HERE TAKE THIS ONE INSTEAD
trainval/TdtoAQFStBk/50001 SO IT RIGIDLY COUPLES TO YOUR SKULL AND GIVES YOU THE MOST PRECISE POSSIBLE MEASUREMENT OF HOW THE SKULL MOVES
trainval/TdtoAQFStBk/50002 PEOPLE HAVE TRIED OTHER APPROACHES WITH HELMETS
trainval/TdtoAQFStBk/50004 AND SO THAT DID SOMETHING FIRST THAT WAS A LITTLE COUNTERINTUITIVE
trainval/TdtoAQFStBk/50005 HIS HEAD DID NOT MOVE TO THE RIGHT
trainval/TdtoAQFStBk/50006 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE NOTICED SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THIS MECHANISM OF INJURY IS ALTHOUGH THERE'S A RAPID
trainval/TdtoAQFStBk/50007 AND THIS MIGHT BE JUST A RESULT OF MY OWN TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE
trainval/TdtoAQFStBk/50008 AND SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS FOR SOME OF YOU OF MORE IMMEDIATE NATURE I'VE GOT A COUPLE YEARS
trainval/TdtoAQFStBk/50009 THERE IS HOPE
trainval/TdtoAQFStBk/50010 SO WHAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING THERE
trainval/te3u3MSpk1c/50001 WHAT DO YOU CALL THE LEADER OF A REPUBLICAN COUNTRY
trainval/te3u3MSpk1c/50002 AND THIS WAS DEBATED IN CONGRESS FOR AGES AND AGES
trainval/te3u3MSpk1c/50003 AND THAT TITLE
trainval/te3u3MSpk1c/50004 BUT NOW DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY NATIONS HAVE A PRESIDENT
trainval/te3u3MSpk1c/50005 A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN
trainval/teVE3VGrBhM/50001 WHAT WAS DRAWING ME INTO THIS SOUND
trainval/teVE3VGrBhM/50002 DID YOU EXPERIENCE THAT AT ALL
trainval/teVE3VGrBhM/50003 IS WHAT I'M SAYING TO MYSELF IN MY HEAD IS IT NECESSARY IN THE EXACT MOMENT IN WHAT I'M DOING WITH MY LIFE RIGHT
trainval/teVE3VGrBhM/50004 SO I WAS THINKING OF AND CREATING WITHIN THE SAME AGE RANGE AS MOST OF YOU AROUND 1516 WHEN I FIRST STARTED
trainval/teVE3VGrBhM/50005 AND AT THAT TIME I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON BECAUSE I WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON SPORTS
trainval/teVE3VGrBhM/50006 AND THERE'S A LOT OF DISTRACTIONS AROUND US ALL THE TIME AS WE KNOW
trainval/TexXAuRSe0g/50001 AND WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
trainval/TexXAuRSe0g/50002 BUT THERE'S SOMETHING YOU MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS STORY WHICH I FIND REALLY INTERESTING
trainval/TexXAuRSe0g/50004 THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS TODAY
trainval/TexXAuRSe0g/50005 YOU CAN START THINKING ABOUT COLLABORATION YOU CAN ACTUALLY MANIPULATE THE SAME HOLOGRAM WITH
trainval/TexXAuRSe0g/50006 THE TRICK IS TO GET THEM TO USE THE SAME VOCABULARY
trainval/TexXAuRSe0g/50007 BUT ONCE YOU DO MAGIC CAN HAPPEN
trainval/TexXAuRSe0g/50008 BUT IT'S NOT JUST TO THROW PEOPLE TOGETHER THERE NEEDS TO BE A BOUNDARY THERE NEEDS TO BE A STRUCTURE ON HOW
trainval/tF1oSdNwE8c/50001 SO STARTING OFF WITH THIS QUESTION CAN WE MAKE BEER IN SPACE
trainval/tF1oSdNwE8c/50002 BUT IN HIGH CONCENTRATIONS ONCE AGAIN YOU DON'T WANT THIS STUFF IN YOUR BEER BECAUSE NOBODY LIKES TO DRINK A PINT OF BUTTER
trainval/tF1oSdNwE8c/50003 OUT OF ALL THOSE MOLECULES THAT WE'RE MISSING AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE NO INFORMATION ON WHERE THEIR PEAKS
trainval/tF1oSdNwE8c/50004 SO THEY COULD WELL BE IN A SPECTRUM LIKE THIS
trainval/TFbv757kup4/50001 HOW COULD IT BE HURTING ME
trainval/TFbv757kup4/50002 IN FACT IT MIGHT EVEN MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER IN THE MOMENT
trainval/TFbv757kup4/50003 BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT WHEN YOU'RE BUSY HOSTING YOUR OWN PITY PARTY
trainval/TFbv757kup4/50004 WHY DO I HAVE TO KEEP LOSING ALL MY LOVED ONES
trainval/tFGCB51xb6U/50001 THIS IS ROUGHLY PRESENT DAY IRAK
trainval/TFvkq4BAvnw/50001 OUR SKIN CELLS ARE SO SMART THAT THEY CAN SENSE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN MUTATED TO THE POINT IN WHICH SKIN
trainval/TFvkq4BAvnw/50002 SO THEY PREFER TO COMMIT SUICIDE
trainval/TFvkq4BAvnw/50003 AND THUS TO ELIMINATE THE VERY SEVERE AND SOMETIMES DEADLY SIDE EFFECTS CAUSED BY TREATMENTS NOWADAYS
trainval/TFvkq4BAvnw/50004 SCHWARZ IN THE WEIZMANN INSTITUTE SEARCHING FOR SOME KIND OF CURE
trainval/TFvkq4BAvnw/50005 EACH TYPE OF BACTERIA GLOWS IN A DIFFERENT COLOR AND GETS A COMMAND TO DIVIDE AND FLOURISH UNDER A DIFFERENT
trainval/TFvkq4BAvnw/50006 SO THEY SAID WHY NOT TAKE REGULAR BACTERIA TO PUT INSIDE SOME GENES WHICH WILL ALLOW IT
trainval/TFvkq4BAvnw/50007 I CAN TAKE FROM SOMEONE S FECES HIS OWN BACTERIA TO INSTALL ONTO THE BACTERIA SOME SOFTWARE
trainval/TFvkq4BAvnw/50008 INTO A BETTER FUTURE IN WHICH WE COULD MAYBE ERADICATE DISEASES SUCH AS CANCER
trainval/TFvkq4BAvnw/50009 OR MAYBE EVEN CURE POLIO
trainval/tFX1nQLZUVM/50001 ONCE HE STEPPED ONTO THE FLOOR AND OUT OF THE BED THE PRESSURE SENSOR WOULD DETECT AN INCREASE IN PRESSURE CAUSED BY BODY WEIGHT AND THEN
trainval/tFX1nQLZUVM/50002 MOTION SENSORS WOULD BE INSTALLED INSIDE THE TILES OF BATHROOM FLOORS TO DETECT THE FALLS OF ELDERLY PATIENTS WHENEVER THEY
trainval/tFX1nQLZUVM/50003 AFTER EXTENSIVE RESEARCH AND TESTING OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS LIKE RUBBER WHICH I REALIZED WAS TOO THICK TO BE WORN SNUGLY ON THE BOTTOM OF THE
trainval/tFX68SJs2S0/50001 DO WE REALLY WANT TO END UP WITH 600 LANGUAGES AND THE MAIN ONE BEING ENGLISH OR CHINESE
trainval/tFX68SJs2S0/50002 WE NEED MORE THAN THAT
trainval/tFX68SJs2S0/50003 AND NEITHER DOES GERMAN
trainval/tFX68SJs2S0/50004 IT'S AN ARABIC MEDIUM SCHOOL
trainval/Tg35UfOJhe4/50001 BUT PERHAPS THE MOST MEMORABLE MEETING I HAD OUT OF ALL OF THESE WAS WHEN I FOUND MYSELF
trainval/Tg35UfOJhe4/50002 MIND YOU MY TEENAGE SELF BRISTLED AT SUCH A SUGGESTION BECAUSE I HAD IT ALL FIGURED OUT ON MY OWN
trainval/Tg35UfOJhe4/50003 I'VE BEEN OFF MEDICATION FOR ALMOST THREE YEARS NOW
trainval/Tg35UfOJhe4/50004 LET'S OPEN OUR HEARTS AND OUR MINDS LET'S OPEN OUR EARS AND OUR MOUTHS AND LET'S
trainval/TgRy2KmcPhw/50001 HI MY NAME IS DAVID
trainval/th3nnEpITz0/50001 WHY DOESN'T THIS MAKE OUR LABOR REDUNDANT AND OUR SKILLS OBSOLETE
trainval/th3nnEpITz0/50002 AN INGENIOUS METAPHOR FOR THIS TRAGIC SETTING IS THE O RING PRODUCTION FUNCTION
trainval/th3nnEpITz0/50003 PROBABLY SOMETHING ELSE WILL BREAK ANYWAY
trainval/th3nnEpITz0/50004 WHY ARE THERE SO FEW FARMERS TODAY
trainval/th3nnEpITz0/50005 THAT'S AMAZING PROGRESS BUT IT ALSO MEANS THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY O RING JOBS LEFT IN FARMING
trainval/th3nnEpITz0/50006 THERE WILL BE JOBS
trainval/th3nnEpITz0/50007 IT'S TYPICALLY RANKED 35TH AMONG NATIONS IN HAPPINESS WHICH IS LOW FOR SUCH A WEALTHY NATION
trainval/th3nnEpITz0/50008 BUT IT'S EQUALLY FOOLISH TO SAY THAT OUR FATES ARE SEALED
trainval/tH5iEf9oxaI/50001 IF YOU WORK FOR ME AND YOU HAVE A FAMILY ISSUE I EXPECT YOU TO ATTEND TO
trainval/tH5iEf9oxaI/50002 THINK ABOUT A LAWYER WHO SPENDS PART OF HIS TIME AT SCHOOL EVENTS FOR HIS KIDS
trainval/tH5iEf9oxaI/50003 AND A 2012 STUDY OF EMPLOYERS SHOWED THAT DEEP FLEXIBLE
trainval/tH5iEf9oxaI/50004 TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN MY FAMILY FIRST STARTED GOING TO ITALY WE USED TO LUXURIATE IN THE CULTURE OF
trainval/tH5iEf9oxaI/50005 SIESTA IS NOT JUST ABOUT AVOIDING THE HEAT OF THE DAY
trainval/tH5iEf9oxaI/50006 NOW WHEN WE GO FEWER AND FEWER BUSINESSES CLOSE FOR SIESTA REFLECTING THE
trainval/tH5iEf9oxaI/50007 AT LEAST IF WE GET BEYOND A BARTER ECONOMY SOMEBODY HAS TO EARN AN INCOME AND
trainval/tH5iEf9oxaI/50008 AND WHAT CRITERIA SHOULD THEY USE TO MAKE THAT DECISION
trainval/tH5iEf9oxaI/50009 OR SWITZERLAND THAT HAVE HIGHER AVERAGE LEVELS OF INCOME BUT LOWER
trainval/tH5iEf9oxaI/50010 MEN ARE STILL SOCIALIZED TO BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE TO BE BREADWINNERS THAT TO
trainval/tH5iEf9oxaI/50011 IT'S CERTAINLY NOT COMPLETE
trainval/tH5iEf9oxaI/50012 THEY TAKE PATERNITY LEAVE WHEN THEY CAN
trainval/tH5iEf9oxaI/50013 THEY GOT MARRIED FIVE YEARS AGO AND NOW THEY HAVE TWO YEAR OLD TWINS
trainval/tH5iEf9oxaI/50014 AS THAT'S NOT FAIR
trainval/tH5iEf9oxaI/50015 LET'S BRING THEM BOTH TOGETHER
trainval/TH9CqtMzxG0/50001 TO BE ABLE TO WALK WITH MY CLASS AND TO GRADUATE ON TIME
trainval/TH9CqtMzxG0/50002 I WENT ON TO FURTHER MY EDUCATION
trainval/THJUvXkqmBk/50001 AND IT BECAME MORE MATURE
trainval/THJUvXkqmBk/50002 TO FIND THE BABY JESUS THE MAGI FOLLOWED A STAR
trainval/THJUvXkqmBk/50003 THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SPACE
trainval/THJUvXkqmBk/50004 AND IT'S NOT A SHAMEFUL THING NOT TO KNOW SOMETHING
trainval/THJUvXkqmBk/50005 WE HAVE JOBS WE HAVE SCHOOL WE HAVE HOMEWORK
trainval/THJUvXkqmBk/50006 WHY AM I GOING TO ASK A QUESTION ABOUT THIS RANDOM THING WHEN I HAVE STATS HOMEWORK TO DO
trainval/THJUvXkqmBk/50007 I DON'T HAVE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT OR ASK QUESTIONS
trainval/THJUvXkqmBk/50008 AND I FIND THIS REALLY SAD BECAUSE WHEN A CHILD ASKS A QUESTION THEY CAN'T NECESSARILY UNDERSTAND THE ANSWER
trainval/THJUvXkqmBk/50009 AND THEY CAN'T NECESSARILY GO OUT AND SEARCH FOR THAT ANSWER AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY FIND
trainval/THJUvXkqmBk/50010 THEY WERE IN THE CENTER OF STARS THAT MADE THIS UNIVERSE
trainval/THJUvXkqmBk/50011 BECAUSE WE RIGHT NOW CAN ONLY REACH FOR THE STARS BUT MAYBE ONE DAY THEY WILL BE ABLE TO
trainval/tHSTfiMtSDE/50001 I STARTED CRYING BECAUSE TO ME IT WASN'T THE REAL BARBIE BECAUSE IT WASN'T THE PRETTY BARBIE
trainval/tHSTfiMtSDE/50002 AND IT'S SO FUNNY BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A SIMPLE THING THAT HELPED ME
trainval/tHSTfiMtSDE/50003 IN MY RESEARCH I CAME ACROSS THE MAMIE CLARK DOLL TEST
trainval/tHSTfiMtSDE/50004 IS ANYONE FAMILIAR WITH THAT
trainval/tHSTfiMtSDE/50005 WHICH ONE IS THE UGLY DOLL
trainval/tHSTfiMtSDE/50006 WHICH ONE IS THE BAD DOLL
trainval/tHSTfiMtSDE/50007 SO TAKING ALL THIS INFORMATION I HAD TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO TAKE MY SKILLS AS AN ARTIST AND WHAT I KNOW ABOUT COLORISM AND
trainval/tHSTfiMtSDE/50008 AT A YOUNG AGE TOYS INFLUENCE HOW WE THINK HOW WE ACT AND HOW WE SEE OURSELVES
trainval/tHSTfiMtSDE/50009 A BLACK BARBIE
trainval/tHSTfiMtSDE/50010 IT'S PRETTY FUN IT MAKES IT EASIER AND IT HELPS GIRLS EMBRACE THEIR NATURAL HAIR
trainval/tHSTfiMtSDE/50011 I LEARNED A LOT
trainval/tHSTfiMtSDE/50013 SHE GOT SO MUCH FINANCIAL SUPPORT
trainval/tHSTfiMtSDE/50014 AND SHE WAS ON ELLEN
trainval/tic7X3ET4gE/50001 INSIDE YOUR PANCREAS IS A SMALL CLUSTER OF CELLS CALLED BETA CELLS
trainval/tic7X3ET4gE/50002 THAT IS HOW IMPORTANT YOUR BETA CELLS ARE YOU WOULD DIE
trainval/tic7X3ET4gE/50003 YOU PROBABLY THOUGHT ABOUT YOUR HEART
trainval/tic7X3ET4gE/50004 YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO CONCENTRATE YOU MIGHT KIND OF WANT TO TAKE A NAP OR YOU MIGHT WANT TO EAT MORE SUGAR
trainval/tic7X3ET4gE/50005 ZUCCHINI MUFFIN WHATEVER
trainval/tic7X3ET4gE/50006 WE HAVE ALL BECOME SO BRAINWASHED TO THINK THAT SUGAR ON A DAILY BASIS IS OKAY
trainval/tic7X3ET4gE/50007 80 OF THE TIME KEEP YOUR FOOD IN HEALTHY WHOLESOME CHOICES AND THEN PUT YOUR SUGAR
trainval/tic7X3ET4gE/50008 THE HIGHLY PROCESSED CARB FOODS
trainval/tic7X3ET4gE/50009 BUT WE'VE GOT IT SWITCHED RIGHT
trainval/tic7X3ET4gE/50011 YOU HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE AND YOU HAVE THE POWER
trainval/tIINqNUediU/50001 LARGELY BECAUSE I THINK I CONSIDERED IT AND I WAS WORRIED THAT OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT THINK IT A FRIVOLOUS WAY TO
trainval/tIINqNUediU/50002 THE GOOD NEWS FOR ME WAS THAT THIS EXPERIENCE FORCED ME TO
trainval/tIINqNUediU/50003 AND IF YOU LOOK AROUND THIS AUDIENCE IT'S PROBABLY THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN THIS AUDIENCE
trainval/tIINqNUediU/50004 PERHAPS ANOTHER STORY WILL HELP DO THAT AS WELL
trainval/tIINqNUediU/50005 WHEN I WAS ASKED TO DESCRIBE MYSELF FOR THIS TALK I CHOSE THREE WORDS
trainval/tiwVMrTLUWg/50001 SO BACK IN 2013 WE HAD THE FIRST TEST OF A SELF DRIVING CAR WHERE WE LET REGULAR PEOPLE
trainval/tiwVMrTLUWg/50002 EVERY ONE OF THEM TOLD US THEY LOVED IT
trainval/tiwVMrTLUWg/50003 WHAT ARE WE THINKING
trainval/tiwVMrTLUWg/50004 ALL THE TIME HE'S BEEN DOING 65 MILES PER HOUR DOWN THE FREEWAY
trainval/tiwVMrTLUWg/50005 WE JUST REDUCED ACCIDENTS ON OUR ROADS BY A FACTOR OF TWO
trainval/tiWwrdMqvvM/50001 I MET PEOPLE FROM BOSNIA FROM KOSOVO FROM CHINA FROM IRAQ IRAN LIBERIA
trainval/tiWwrdMqvvM/50002 PEOPLE FLEEING FOR THEIR LIVES
trainval/tiWwrdMqvvM/50003 WHAT I FOUND WAS LOTS OF LITERATURE ON REFUGEES
trainval/tiWwrdMqvvM/50004 THEY'VE BEEN IN EXILE FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS
trainval/tiWwrdMqvvM/50005 CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING BORN IN A REFUGEE CAMP GROWING UP IN A REFUGEE CAMP BECOMING AN ADULT
trainval/tiWwrdMqvvM/50006 AND HE'S BEEN THERE SINCE
trainval/tiWwrdMqvvM/50007 NOW IN HIS MID 40S HE SUFFERS FROM DIABETES AND HYPERTENSION AND HE'S GIVEN UP HOPE OF LEAVING
trainval/tiWwrdMqvvM/50008 NOW THERE'S NOTHING INEVITABLE ABOUT WULI'S SITUATION
trainval/tiWwrdMqvvM/50009 BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE
trainval/tiWwrdMqvvM/50010 THEY ARE NOT
trainval/tiWwrdMqvvM/50011 THERE IS ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT THIS
trainval/tiWwrdMqvvM/50012 IS THERE ANOTHER WORLD WE CAN IMAGINE IN WHICH WE DOCUMENT THAT POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION
trainval/tiWwrdMqvvM/50013 AND WE ALSO CONDUCTED A SURVEY IN THREE DIFFERENT SITES
trainval/tiWwrdMqvvM/50014 THE URBAN CONTEXT OF THE CAPITAL CITY KAMPALA AND TWO REFUGEE SETTLEMENTS AMONG SOMALIS
trainval/tiWwrdMqvvM/50015 THERE WERE MANY EXAMPLES OF CONTRIBUTIONS
trainval/tiWwrdMqvvM/50016 ONE EXAMPLE OF A BUSINESS WAS THERE WAS PUBLIC TRANSPORT SYSTEM
trainval/tiWwrdMqvvM/50017 BUSES RUN DAILY BETWEEN THE NAKIVALE REFUGEE SETTLEMENT AND THE CAPITAL CITY TRANSPORTING REFUGEES
trainval/tiWwrdMqvvM/50018 BUT THAT BUSINESS ISN'T RUN BY UGANDANS
trainval/tiWwrdMqvvM/50019 THEY HAD A HUGE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES
trainval/tiWwrdMqvvM/50020 THERE WAS ALSO INEQUALITY
trainval/tiWwrdMqvvM/50021 THERE WAS A HUGE VARIATION IN OUTCOMES
trainval/tiWwrdMqvvM/50022 ON THE CONTRARY WE FOUND ALMOST UBIQUITOUS MOBILE PHONE USE
trainval/tiWwrdMqvvM/50023 IT'S NOT THAT PAINFUL BUT IT'S QUITE EMBARRASSING
trainval/tiWwrdMqvvM/50024 TAKE THE EXAMPLE OF LEBANON WITH A POPULATION OF JUST OVER 4 MILLION
trainval/tiWwrdMqvvM/50025 OVER A QUARTER OF ITS POPULATION ARE NOW SYRIAN REFUGEES
trainval/tiWwrdMqvvM/50026 BUT IT LACKS TWO THINGS
trainval/tiWwrdMqvvM/50027 FOOD SHELTER AND CLOTHING ARE ALL NECESSARY AND NEEDED
trainval/tJ54irRmdC0/50001 I FELT UNWANTED
trainval/tJ54irRmdC0/50002 WE WERE MORE FLEXIBLE
trainval/tJ54irRmdC0/50003 EVEN THOUGH HE WAS FROM SERBIA HE WAS A MUSLIM
trainval/tJ54irRmdC0/50004 SHE WAS AFRAID SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO HIM
trainval/tJ54irRmdC0/50005 I COULDN'T REBOUND
trainval/tJ54irRmdC0/50006 I LOST BALLS ALL THE TIME
trainval/TjaM0tdxtYA/50001 SO WHAT DID I DO IN MY SPARE TIME
trainval/tjkrKA1cVdU/50001 ABOUT THREE SECONDS AGO
trainval/tjkrKA1cVdU/50003 HE GOES I LOVE WHAT YOU DO
trainval/tjkrKA1cVdU/50004 THAT'S WHAT WE'RE PROGRAMMED TO DO
trainval/tjkrKA1cVdU/50005 I TALK ABOUT FUTURES
trainval/tkIgSSxPzTA/50002 THERE ARE SPOTS ON THE PAPER THAT ARE STICKY
trainval/tkIgSSxPzTA/50003 AND WHEN IT FOLDS CORRECTLY THESE STICKY BITS END UP ON THE INSIDE
trainval/tkIgSSxPzTA/50004 CUTTING OTHERS MIGHT MAKE THE BOMB EXPLORE
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50001 YOU EXPECT TO MEET A MONSTER
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50002 HE LOOKS LIKE YOUR NEXT BEST FRIEND
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50003 AND SO YOU GET CONFUSED
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50004 THEN YOU THINK THAT THESE PEOPLE MUST HAVE BEEN WRONG
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50005 SO THAT MADE ME THINK BUT WHY
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50006 THEY TEND TO WANT TO SWEEP IT UNDER THE CARPET TO PRETEND IT DOESN'T EXIST
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50007 AND QUITE OFTEN THEY'LL DO THINGS LIKE THEY'LL PAY OFF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING BULLIED
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50008 SO IT ALL GETS SWEPT UNDER THE CARPET
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50009 IT TENDS TO BE AGAINST THE COMPANY
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50010 AND WHEN I WAS MOVED OFFICES I WAS TOLD I WAS GETTING A NEW BOSS
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50011 SO YOU'LL STOP WORKING PROPERLY YOU'LL SABOTAGE NORMAL WORK PROCESSES YOU'LL
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50013 WELL CORPORATE PSYCHOPATHS ARE THOSE PSYCHOPATHS WHO ARE ABOUT 1 OF THE
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50014 AND VARIOUS PEOPLE CAME UP TO ME AND SAID YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THIS NEW GUY THIS NEW BOSS YOU'RE GETTING
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50015 AND SO THEY GO INTO THE CORPORATE WORLD
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50016 SO THE SAME WORDS ARE USED TO DESCRIBE THEM THESE PSYCHOPATHS AS I USED TO DESCRIBE
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50017 AND WHEN PEOPLE SAY THINGS LIKE THAT TO YOU THAT'S WHAT YOU EXPECT
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50018 THEY CAN BE TOTALLY RUTHLESS AND SLEEP PERFECTLY WELL THAT NIGHT BECAUSE NOTHING THEY DO
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50019 AND IF THERE ARE PSYCHOPATHS THERE WILL BE BULLYING
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50020 PSYCHOPATHS BULLY FOR TWO MAIN REASONS
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50021 ONE OF THEM IS PREDATORY
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50022 SO THEY DO IT BECAUSE THEY LIKE IT
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50023 THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THEY DO IT
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50024 THE OTHER REASON THEY DO IT IS WHAT I'VE CALLED INSTRUMENTAL BULLYING
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50025 SO THEY'RE DOING IT QUITE OFTEN TO CREATE CONFUSION AND CHAOS ALL AROUND THEM
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50026 SO ANYBODY FOR EXAMPLE A BOSS LOOKING DOWN ON THIS WHOLE SITUATION OF BULLYING AND EMOTIONAL
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50027 AND THEREFORE THE ONLY PERSON THAT SEEMS LIKE THEY WANT
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50028 SO IF YOU LINK IT AT AN ORGANIZATIONAL LEVEL COMPANIES LIKE ENRON
trainval/tlB1pFwGhA4/50029 IT WAS 346 MANAGERS RESEARCH CARRIED OUT IN 2008
trainval/tlS3r8Gid90/50001 THE NEXT MORNING I WALKED IN TO CHECK ON MY PATIENT
trainval/tlS3r8Gid90/50002 I MEASURED MY BODY TEMPERATURE SEVERAL TIMES
trainval/tlS3r8Gid90/50004 THAT SUMMER WE HAD A NURSE WHO HAD BEEN SICK FOR A WHILE
trainval/TM4HiNOhkM0/50001 THEY KEPT THE PRICES HIGH AND CHASED PATENT INFRINGERS
trainval/TM4HiNOhkM0/50002 AND THERE WAS AN EXODUS OF DYERS TO GERMANY AND SWITZERLAND
trainval/Tmk7nAvpMXQ/50001 BUT I STILL GO TO WORK EVERY DAY
trainval/Tmk7nAvpMXQ/50002 BUT WE DON'T WANT MODELS TO BE PERFECT
trainval/Tmk7nAvpMXQ/50003 WELL TO A LARGE EXTENT IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T AGREE ON WHAT CLOUDS WILL DO IN THE FUTURE
trainval/Tmk7nAvpMXQ/50004 CLOUDS ARE FORMED WHEN MICROSCOPIC WATER DROPLETS OR ICE CRYSTALS COALESCE
trainval/Tmk7nAvpMXQ/50005 THAT IS A LOT OF WASTED SOLAR POWER
trainval/Tmk7nAvpMXQ/50006 RIGHT NOW THESE TWO EFFECTS THEY DON'T CANCEL OUT
trainval/Tmk7nAvpMXQ/50007 THAT SUNSHADE IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE POWERFUL
trainval/Tmk7nAvpMXQ/50008 AND AS A RESULT THERE ARE GAPS IN OUR KNOWLEDGE
trainval/Tmk7nAvpMXQ/50009 CLOUDS COULD HELP US OUT WITH GLOBAL WARMING
trainval/TMoYQhyxViw/50001 SO WHY DID I GO BACK
trainval/TMoYQhyxViw/50002 IT WAS PRETTY BAD
trainval/TMoYQhyxViw/50003 TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE BEING ILL MADE IT HARD FOR ME TO WRITE SONGS
trainval/tMSehhs1OSk/50001 IT'S ALL ABOUT LEARNING HOW TO THINK
trainval/tMSehhs1OSk/50002 CODING IS THE HOME ECONOMICS OF TOMORROW
trainval/tMSehhs1OSk/50003 THE STUDENTS THAT HAVE ACCESS TO THESE COURSES ARE NOT JUST LEARNING HOW TO CODE AND MANIPULATE TECHNOLOGY
trainval/tMSehhs1OSk/50004 HOW THE TECHNOLOGIES THEY USE EVERY SINGLE DAY WORK
trainval/tMSehhs1OSk/50005 THIS PROGRAM WILL KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO
trainval/tMSU6k5SWXg/50001 BUT SCIENTISTS SHOULD SURELY BE PRECAUTIONARY ABOUT EXPERIMENTS THAT GENERATE CONDITIONS WITHOUT
trainval/tNKdc6Lxcvo/50001 OUR CENTURY WILL MOST PROBABLY BE THE AGE OF BIOLOGY
trainval/tNKdc6Lxcvo/50002 BUT THEY ARE VERY GOOD AS STARTING POINTS FOR FURTHER SEARCHING
trainval/tNKdc6Lxcvo/50004 ANYWAY IN ALL THESE EXAMPLES THE COMPUTER CAN ONLY EMULATE HUMAN DEFINED
trainval/tNKdc6Lxcvo/50005 AND OF COURSE ARTISTS INFLUENCE AND CHANGE THE ENVIRONMENT
trainval/tNKdc6Lxcvo/50006 YOU KNOW WHEN EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT INSIGHT ILLUMINATION INSPIRATION
trainval/tNKdc6Lxcvo/50007 I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY ALL THOSE WORDS BEGIN WITH AN I
trainval/tNKdc6Lxcvo/50008 BUT WHAT INDEED IS THE ENVIRONMENT HERE
trainval/TOSSkVIkY6A/50001 DEMOCRACY IN ALL ITS TRAPPINGS FREE ELECTIONS TOWN HALLS ENDLESS DEBATES ABOUT
trainval/TOSSkVIkY6A/50002 TOO MESSY TOO UNPREDICTABLE TOO CONSTRAINING FOR YOUR TASTE
trainval/TOSSkVIkY6A/50003 IN EARLY FEBRUARY 2014 A FEW WEEKS BEFORE RUSSIA WOULD INVADE CRIMEA A PHONE CALL IS POSTED
trainval/tp4Z4EVFA0g/50001 IT IS A COMPUTER
trainval/tp4Z4EVFA0g/50002 WHY DESKTOP COMPUTERS
trainval/TPA0qoemShQ/50001 YET WE SEE NOW A SYSTEM WHERE THAT RIGHT TO PROTECT YOU AND GET YOU A HOUSE DIDN'T HELP MATTHEW AND
trainval/TPA0qoemShQ/50002 MICHAEL HAD BEEN SUMMONED IN TO ATTEND A FITNESS FOR WORK INTERVIEW WHICH DESPITE HIS MANY
trainval/TPA0qoemShQ/50003 WHEN SO MANY PEOPLE ARE LIVING AND WORKING THROUGH JOBS WHERE THEY ARE NOT SURE HOW LONG THEIR EMPLOYMENTS ARE GOING TO LAST FOR
trainval/TPA0qoemShQ/50004 LAST YEAR AT A FOOTBALL TOURNAMENT IN ENGLAND A GROUP OF KIDS WHO HAD REACHED THE SEMI FINAL STAGE HAD TO
trainval/TPA0qoemShQ/50005 THIS IS YOUR RIGHT
trainval/TPA0qoemShQ/50006 THIS REMINDS US THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO EACH OTHER AND A RELATIONSHIP AS A
trainval/TPA0qoemShQ/50007 AND IT'S NOT FREE MONEY IT'S NOT MONEY FOR NOTHING IT'S NOT THE IDEA OF GIVING PEOPLE NOTHING FOR WE
trainval/TPA0qoemShQ/50010 ALL OF US RELY UPON THE STRUCTURES OF THE STATE OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS AND OF WHAT HAS BEEN DONE FOR
trainval/TPA0qoemShQ/50011 MOST OF US PROBABLY CAN THINK OF IT PRETTY QUICKLY SADLY SOME PEOPLE WILL STILL PROBABLY BE IN IT
trainval/TPA0qoemShQ/50012 BUT THE LACK OF ACCESS TO FOOD DURING SCHOOL HOLIDAYS MEANT THAT THESE CHILDREN WERE GOING HUNGRY IN A
trainval/TPA0qoemShQ/50013 IN SCOTLAND AND HERE IN GLASGOW WE'RE EXPLORING EXPERIMENTS ABOUT HOW WE CAN TEST THIS OUT IN PRACTICE
trainval/TPA0qoemShQ/50014 HOW MANY WORLD CHANGING IDEAS POTENTIALLY GET LOST THROUGH THAT WHICH ACCESS TO A SECURE
trainval/TpC8wNkjSvs/50001 AND NOT TO MENTION AL GORE'S INCONVENIENT TRUTH IN 2006 THAT ADDRESSED TO THE WORLD WITH FACTUAL IPCC
trainval/TpC8wNkjSvs/50002 ALL OF THIS IS GREAT
trainval/TpC8wNkjSvs/50003 IT HELPS US TO RAISE AWARENESS
trainval/tPgQsv2KPwc/50001 I THINK THAT'S WHAT HELPED DRIVE THIS
trainval/tPgQsv2KPwc/50002 THIS IS THAT GREAT BIG SECRET
trainval/tpH2fhwCzSM/50001 NOW THESE DAYS WITH SO MANY PEOPLE HIKING AROUND IT'S PRETTY HARD TO FIND A NEW CAVE SO YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW EXCITED WE WERE TO
trainval/tpH2fhwCzSM/50002 IF YOU SQUISH A HANDFUL OF SNOW TO MAKE A SNOWBALL IT GETS REALLY SMALL HARD AND DENSE
trainval/tpH2fhwCzSM/50003 DIFFERENT WATERFALLS POP UP OR MOVE AROUND FROM PLACE TO PLACE INSIDE THE CAVE
trainval/tpH2fhwCzSM/50004 AROUND THIS HALF OF THE COUNTRY MOST OF YOUR CAVES ARE MADE OF LIMESTONE
trainval/tpH2fhwCzSM/50005 WELL NOT TOO MUCH LIVES IN THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE SO COLD AND THE ENTRANCE IS ACTUALLY COVERED UP WITH SNOW FOR ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS OF THE
trainval/tpH2fhwCzSM/50006 EVERY YEAR NEW CAVES GET DISCOVERED THAT NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN IN BEFORE
trainval/tpKWHSsBpnE/50001 I HAVE A GLOBAL VISION FOR VISION
trainval/tpKWHSsBpnE/50002 HOW DO YOU DISTRIBUTE
trainval/tpODOkfrwyQ/50001 BUT I REALISE SOMETIMES LATER THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER LESSON AND THAT LESSON WAS THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE
trainval/tpODOkfrwyQ/50002 THAT'S A WIN WIN WIN WIN
trainval/tpODOkfrwyQ/50003 NOW IS IN A VERY ENCOURAGING DEBATE AND THIS IS OF ONE EXAMPLE OF MANY MANY DIFFERENT
trainval/tqf607N19Is/50001 SO THEY HAVEN'T HURT THEMSELVES AS SEVERELY AS US BUT FOR US IT MEANT THAT WE BROKE OUR LEGS
trainval/tqf607N19Is/50002 I'M ONE THIRD OF AN ORGANIZATION CALLED THE SELF ESTEEM TEAM AND WE TRAVEL SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES THROUGHOUT THE UK AND
trainval/tqf607N19Is/50003 WE KNOW THAT HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR SELF HARM AND EATING DISORDERS HAVE DOUBLED IN THE PAST THREE YEARS
trainval/tqf607N19Is/50004 BETWEEN THE AGES OF 24 AND 35 SUICIDE ACCOUNTS FOR ONE IN FOUR MALE
trainval/tqf607N19Is/50005 AND THAT SOUNDS STUPID BUT THERE IS ACTUALLY SOME REALLY GOOD EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT THEORY THAT THE TWO ARE
trainval/tqf607N19Is/50006 AND YOUNG MINDS A CHARITY THAT WORKS IN THE UK IN 2014 DID EXACTLY THAT
trainval/tqf607N19Is/50007 THEY SURVEYED 5000 YOUNG PEOPLE
trainval/tqf607N19Is/50008 WHEN I WAS BORN IN 1981 MY DAD HAD A MARKET STORE AND MY MUM WAS AN ASSISTANT BUYER FOR A
trainval/tqf607N19Is/50009 BUT THEY COULD AFFORD A MORTGAGE ON A MODEST PROPERTY THEY COULD AFFORD TO RUN A CAR AND THEY COULD AFFORD TO FEED AND CLOTHE
trainval/tqf607N19Is/50010 YOU SAY WHAT'S CAUSING THIS
trainval/tqf607N19Is/50011 WE ALSO INCIDENTALLY TRAIL BEHIND COUNTRIES IN SCANDINAVIA IN NUMERACY AND LITERACY
trainval/tqf607N19Is/50012 IN SCANDINAVIA YOU DON'T GO TO SCHOOL UNTIL YOU ARE EIGHT
trainval/tqf607N19Is/50013 BUT INSTEAD OUR GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO ASPIRE TO AN EDUCATION SYSTEM LIKE THEY HAVE IN KOREA WHERE
trainval/tqf607N19Is/50014 AND THE PROBLEM ABOUT CONVERSATIONS SURROUNDING ADVERTISING IS THAT NOBODY EVER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE IMPACT IS CUMULATIVE
trainval/tqf607N19Is/50015 TAKE FOR EXAMPLE LAST WEEK
trainval/tqf607N19Is/50016 SHE LOOKS LOVELY I DON'T SEE THE PROBLEM
trainval/tqf607N19Is/50018 THERE ARE SO MANY TOXIC IDEAS THAT PERMEATE OUR SOCIETY THE NARRATIVE BY WHICH WE
trainval/tqf607N19Is/50019 AND OF COURSE CHANGE IS SCARY
trainval/tqf607N19Is/50021 YOU CAN'T GET AWAY FROM THAT
trainval/TQMbvJNRpLE/50001 BUT THE TYPE OF MARGINAL IMPROVEMENTS THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT ARE EASILY ACHIEVABLE BY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF
trainval/TQMbvJNRpLE/50002 I WOULD BREAK IT DOWN INTO THESE TASKS THAT I COULD ACHIEVE THAT WOULD REQUIRE ME TO FOCUS FOR JUST
trainval/TQMbvJNRpLE/50003 AND I WENT TO BERLIN FOR A 16 DAY INTENSIVE GERMAN COURSE
trainval/TQMbvJNRpLE/50004 WHY AM I STOPPING AT SEVEN INCHES
trainval/TQMbvJNRpLE/50005 SO WHAT OTHER BIG AMBITIOUS GOALS I'VE BEEN HOLDING ONTO PUTTING OFF UNTIL RETIREMENT THAT I
trainval/TQMbvJNRpLE/50006 IT'S ABOUT THOSE TINY LITTLE DECISIONS YOU KNOW LIKE WHEN YOU ARE SITTING AT YOUR DESK PUTTING IN JUST A LITTLE EXTRA TIME
trainval/TQMbvJNRpLE/50007 THAT'S NOT WHAT IT'S ABOUT
trainval/TQMbvJNRpLE/50008 YOU WRAP THESE PUBLIC STRUCTURES WITH YARN
trainval/TqxxCYnAxo8/50001 ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO WE AS A FAMILY MET WITH AN ACCIDENT WHILE AT BIG BEAR LAKE IN CALIFORNIA
trainval/TRE4Sll42lE/50001 THERE WERE NO MINDY KALINGS OR RUSSELL PETERS THERE WERE JUST APUS FROM THE SIMPSONS
trainval/TRE4Sll42lE/50002 HE'D COME IN BLARING THE BOLLYWOOD TOP 40 {LG}
trainval/TRE4Sll42lE/50003 SO I DECIDED I WAS GOING TO START DOING STAND UP WHEN I WAS 16 YEARS OLD
trainval/TRE4Sll42lE/50004 AND I WAS MAKING JOKES FROM AN HONEST PLACE AND BECAUSE I WAS UNIQUE I GOT THESE OPPORTUNITIES SO QUICKLY
trainval/TRE4Sll42lE/50005 I GOT TO OPEN FOR RUSSELL PETERS I GOT TO FLY TO SOUTH AFRICA AND DO COMEDY THERE I DID TV
trainval/TRE4Sll42lE/50006 AND I NEED YOU GUYS TO PARTICIPATE HERE
trainval/TRE4Sll42lE/50007 WHEN I FINISH THE SENTENCE I NEED YOU GUYS TO GASP ALRIGHT
trainval/TRE4Sll42lE/50008 IT WAS SO DIFFICULT
trainval/TRE4Sll42lE/50009 I REMEMBER I WAS HAVING A COFFEE WITH ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL COMICS IN THE COUNTRY AND THEIR ADVICE TO ME WAS STAY IN THE
trainval/TRE4Sll42lE/50010 THESE CHICKS BESIDE ME JUDGING
trainval/TRE4Sll42lE/50011 I WASN'T WRITING I WASN'T FLOWING I WAS CLOGGING MYSELF UP SO I DECIDED I WAS ON A COLLEAGE TOUR IN THE STATES
trainval/TRE4Sll42lE/50012 EVERY SINGLE SHOW I WOULD MAKE SOME JOKE ABOUT BEING GAY
trainval/TRE4Sll42lE/50013 SHE BECAME MY WIFE
trainval/TRE4Sll42lE/50014 COMING OUT CAN BE LIKE CLIFF JUMPING
trainval/TRE4Sll42lE/50015 WE ARE ALL DIFFERENT AND WE ARE ALL THE SAME
trainval/TRE4Sll42lE/50016 PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO HATE THEY WANT TO LOVE
trainval/TRE4Sll42lE/50017 THE TERRORISTS HAVE ARRIVED
trainval/TRE4Sll42lE/50018 DAD ISN'T THAT LETTING THE WRONG PEOPLE WIN
trainval/TRE4Sll42lE/50019 SOME COMICS GO FOR LAUGHTER I GO FOR THAT SPECIAL SILENCE WHERE YOU CAN HEAR ALL THE EQUIPMENT IN THE ROOM
trainval/tRjqFPwcJgY/50001 SO BY COMPARISON BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT EXAMPLES WHICH ONE CAN SEE ARE ALL RELATED WE ALL
trainval/tRjqFPwcJgY/50002 I WAS VERY DYSLEXIC AS A CHILD WHICH IS WHY I HAD TO HAVE HELP WITH THE LETTER TO SUCH AN EXTENT
trainval/tRjqFPwcJgY/50003 ZEBRAS TIGERS AND SO ON THIS CHEMICAL PHENOMENA
trainval/tRqJysISyiw/50001 SO HOW CAN WE MAKE PANCREATIC CANCER TREATMENT MORE EFFECTIVE
trainval/tRqJysISyiw/50002 THEY WILL REACH HEALTHY ORGANS RESULTING IN HIGH TOXIC EFFECT FOR THE PATIENTS
trainval/tRqJysISyiw/50003 WE ARE WORKING RELENTLESSLY TO BRING THIS TECHNOLOGY TO THE NEXT LEVEL
trainval/tRqJysISyiw/50004 WE ARE FINALIZING THE PRE CLINICAL TESTING AND THE ANIMAL MODEL REQUIRED PRIOR TO ASKING
trainval/tS2aISc3Q8A/50001 I REMEMBER BEING YOUNG I WOULD WALK DOWN THE HALLWAYS OF MY SCHOOL AND I WOULD TAP RHYTHMS TO MYSELF ON MY LEG WITH MY
trainval/ts5MKtXNpMQ/50001 HOW ABOUT 10 TIMES
trainval/ts5MKtXNpMQ/50002 AND SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY BALANCE THOSE TWO THINGS
trainval/ts5MKtXNpMQ/50003 HOW THEY GOT TO WHERE THEY ARE MAY BE IMPORTANT IN SHAPING THE INPUT INFORMATION BUT ONCE WE KNOW
trainval/ts9JpM0gHMU/50001 SO I DECIDED THE FIRST THING I COULD DO WAS TELL THEM A STORY ABOUT STORYTELLING
trainval/ts9JpM0gHMU/50003 SOMEBODY ASKED HIM ONCE HOW HE MANAGED IT AND HIS ANSWER WAS THIS
trainval/ts9JpM0gHMU/50004 THAT REMINDS ME OF A STORY
trainval/ts9JpM0gHMU/50005 AND AT THE CENTER OF EVERY TARGET WAS AN ARROW
trainval/ts9JpM0gHMU/50006 THE CHILD NODDED
trainval/ts9JpM0gHMU/50007 AND THE KING SAID HOW DID YOU MANAGE IT
trainval/ts9JpM0gHMU/50009 BECAUSE I KNEW THAT I HAD FAILED
trainval/ts9JpM0gHMU/50010 AND I HAD TO SIT DOWN AND ASK MYSELF WHY
trainval/ts9JpM0gHMU/50011 AND THAT'S IMPORTANT
trainval/ts9JpM0gHMU/50012 THE RABBI OF DUBNO WAS NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER
trainval/ts9JpM0gHMU/50013 HIS NAME WAS YAAKOV KRANTZ AND HE WAS REAL
trainval/ts9JpM0gHMU/50014 HE KNEW HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF THEM HE REALLY GENUINELY DID AND HIS STORIES WENT INTO
trainval/ts9JpM0gHMU/50015 I HAPPENED TO BE COMP RING WHICH IS LIKE THE KISS OF DEATH TO SOMEBODY IN A JOB LIKE MINE
trainval/ts9JpM0gHMU/50016 IT'S A REMINDER
trainval/ts9JpM0gHMU/50018 IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG YOU HAVE NO POWER BUT ALL THE RESPONSIBILITY AS THE COMP RE
trainval/ts9JpM0gHMU/50019 AND I FINISHED 20 MINUTES EARLY
trainval/ts9JpM0gHMU/50021 IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE FIND IN THE STORY IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE BRING TO THE STORY
trainval/ts9JpM0gHMU/50022 WE TALK ABOUT GRIMM'S FAIRYTALES
trainval/ts9JpM0gHMU/50023 THERE ARE NO GRIMM'S FAIRYTALES
trainval/ts9JpM0gHMU/50024 THE GRIMMS DIDN'T TELL ANY FAIRYTALES
trainval/ts9JpM0gHMU/50025 AND IF GRIMM'S FAIRYTALES WERE NAMED ACCORDING TO AUTHOR RATHER THAN TO EDITOR THEN THEY'D BE CALLED SOMETHING LIKE
trainval/ts9JpM0gHMU/50026 AND THE STORY WAS SIMPLY THIS
trainval/ts9JpM0gHMU/50027 UNDERNEATH WE ARE THE SAME
trainval/tsFKSfItBoE/50001 ALL PERFORMING ARTS THEREFORE USE MUSIC TO MAKE US FEEL
trainval/tsFKSfItBoE/50002 BUT IT S MORE THAN THAT
trainval/tsFKSfItBoE/50003 MUSIC IS PROCESSED IN OLDER DEEPER CENTERS OF THE BRAIN THAN OUR COGNITIVE
trainval/tsFKSfItBoE/50004 THAT S ALSO NOT A NEW IDEA
trainval/tsFKSfItBoE/50005 HE WAS PERHAPS POETICIZING PLATO WHO WROTE
trainval/tsFKSfItBoE/50007 LET S FACE IT
trainval/tsFKSfItBoE/50008 WHAT IS IT THAT REALLY EXCITES US IN THE MOMENT OF A GREAT SPEECH
trainval/tsFKSfItBoE/50009 IT S THAT GATHERING OF MOMENTUM DRIVING TOWARDS THE GLORIOUS CULMINATING FINAL STATEMENT OF THE PREMISE
trainval/tsFKSfItBoE/50010 WHAT IS THAT
trainval/tsFKSfItBoE/50015 SHORT SHORT SHORT LONG
trainval/tsFKSfItBoE/50016 I HAVE A DREAM
trainval/tsFKSfItBoE/50017 AFTER A LONG DAY UNWIND AS YOU NORMALLY WOULD
trainval/tsFKSfItBoE/50018 WATCH THE NEWS
trainval/tsFKSfItBoE/50019 YES WE STRUGGLE
trainval/tsFKSfItBoE/50020 BUT THAT S JUST THE WAY THE WORLD IS
trainval/tsFKSfItBoE/50021 WHEN WE PERCEIVE THE UNIVERSAL WE COME TO AN OBSERVATIONAL STATE
trainval/tsFKSfItBoE/50022 ONE OF AMERICA S FIRST GREAT COMPOSERS WAS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS
trainval/tsFKSfItBoE/50023 WE MARGINALIZE THE ARTS IN SOCIETY
trainval/tsFKSfItBoE/50024 WE LIMIT THE OPPORTUNITY OF YOUNG PEOPLE TO STUDY MUSIC AT OUR PERIL
trainval/tsFKSfItBoE/50025 IT LIMITS NOT ONLY OUR EMPATHY AND OUR CONNECTION BUT EVEN OUR ABILITY TO PERCEIVE
trainval/tsgvhP07BC8/50001 AND SO THAT'S WHY THE DEATH RATE DID COME DOWN
trainval/tsgvhP07BC8/50002 SO EVERY TOOL THAT WE'VE EVER HAD IN THE PAST HAS EVENTUALLY BECOME INEFFECTIVE
trainval/tsgvhP07BC8/50003 IF YOU GO INTO A COUNTRY WITH THE RIGHT TOOLS AND THE RIGHT WAY YOU DO IT VIGOROUSLY YOU CAN
trainval/tsgvhP07BC8/50004 BUT THAT ALONE DOESN'T GIVE US THE ROAD MAP
trainval/tsgvhP07BC8/50005 IT INVOLVES SOCIAL SCIENTISTS SO WE KNOW HOW TO GET NOT JUST 70 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE TO USE THE BED NETS BUT
trainval/tsgvhP07BC8/50006 WE NEED MATHEMATICIANS TO COME IN AND SIMULATE THIS TO DO MONTE CARLO THINGS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE TOOLS
trainval/tsgvhP07BC8/50007 WE NEED RICH WORLD GOVERNMENTS TO BE VERY GENEROUS IN PROVIDING AID FOR THESE THINGS
trainval/tsgvhP07BC8/50008 AND THOSE TOP 20 PERCENT HAVE BEEN THE BEST IN THE WORLD IF YOU MEASURE THEM AGAINST THE OTHER TOP
trainval/tsgvhP07BC8/50009 AT THE FOREFRONT
trainval/tsgvhP07BC8/50010 NOW THE STRENGTH FOR THOSE TOP 20 PERCENT IS STARTING TO FADE ON A RELATIVE
trainval/tsgvhP07BC8/50011 NOT ONLY HAS THAT BEEN WEAK
trainval/tsgvhP07BC8/50012 IT'S GETTING WEAKER
trainval/tsgvhP07BC8/50013 AND WE HAVE TO CHANGE THIS
trainval/tsgvhP07BC8/50014 AND THAT HAD BEEN COVERED UP FOR A LONG TIME BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS TOOK THE DROPOUT RATE AS THE NUMBER WHO STARTED IN SENIOR YEAR
trainval/tsgvhP07BC8/50015 THAT MEANS THAT IF THE ENTIRE U
trainval/tsgvhP07BC8/50016 AND THE ANSWER IS NO
trainval/tsgvhP07BC8/50017 BECAUSE YOUR PAY GOES UP AND YOU VEST INTO YOUR PENSION
trainval/tsgvhP07BC8/50018 THEY'RE CONSTANTLY IMPROVING THEIR TEACHERS
trainval/tsgvhP07BC8/50019 THEY'RE TAKING DATA THE TEST SCORES AND SAYING TO A TEACHER HEY YOU CAUSED THIS AMOUNT OF INCREASE
trainval/tsgvhP07BC8/50020 EVERYBODY NEEDS TO BE INVOLVED
trainval/tsgvhP07BC8/50021 AND SO KIPP IS DOING IT
trainval/tsgvhP07BC8/50022 BUT I I'M OPTIMISTIC
trainval/tsgvhP07BC8/50023 I THINK PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO RECOGNIZE HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS AND IT REALLY CAN
trainval/tSK6bn9sc50/50001 IN THE SPRING IT CAN BE A CACOPHONY OF SOUND
trainval/tSK6bn9sc50/50002 WHAT DO I MEAN BY SOUNDSCAPE
trainval/tSSNoFstCmQ/50001 THEY MAKE HUMAN EFFORTS DERAIL
trainval/tSSNoFstCmQ/50002 THEY ARE THE FAVORITE TEAM TO WIN
trainval/tSSNoFstCmQ/50003 AND THIS YEAR THE US TEAM IS IN GREAT SHAPE
trainval/tSSNoFstCmQ/50005 THIS IS MATH
trainval/tSSNoFstCmQ/50006 COMPLIANCE AUDITS CONSULTANTS' DIAGNOSTICS
trainval/tSSNoFstCmQ/50007 FROM 83 TO 95 TWO PERCENT PER ANNUM
trainval/tSSNoFstCmQ/50008 WE WILL KNOW WHO TO BLAME
trainval/tSSNoFstCmQ/50010 IT WILL COME AT THE EXPENSE OF YOUR MEASURABLE SPEED
trainval/tSSNoFstCmQ/50011 BUT BUSINESS HAS BECOME MUCH MORE COMPLEX
trainval/tSSNoFstCmQ/50012 YOU KNOW THIS DRIVE FOR CLARITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TRIGGERS A
trainval/tSSNoFstCmQ/50014 BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS TEAMS IN THESE ORGANIZATIONS SPEND BETWEEN 40 AND 80
trainval/tSSNoFstCmQ/50015 WE ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO PUT ACCOUNTABILITY IN SOMEONE'S HANDS
trainval/tSSNoFstCmQ/50016 DID YOU THROW IT OR DID YOU PASS IT
trainval/tSSNoFstCmQ/50017 WE NEED SOMEBODY ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS PROCESS
trainval/TT6qWghHkFI/50001 ALL WE HAVE IS 18 MINUTES TO SPEAK TO YOU
trainval/TT6qWghHkFI/50002 SO I'VE BEEN UP SINCE 3 AM
trainval/TT6qWghHkFI/50003 I LIVE MY TRUTH I WALK MY TRUTH I BREATHE MY TRUTH
trainval/TT6qWghHkFI/50004 OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY MOMENTS WHEN I AM DISCONNECTED FROM MY TRUTH BUT I KNOW WHERE TO GO I SIT DOWN ON THAT MEDITATION
trainval/TT6qWghHkFI/50005 I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH BECAUSE I HAD A TERRIBLE CASE OF THE WHEN I HAVES
trainval/TT6qWghHkFI/50006 WHEN I HAVE THAT NEW CLIENT I'LL BE HAPPY
trainval/TT6qWghHkFI/50007 WHEN I HAVE THAT NEW PAIR OF SHOES I'LL BE HAPPY
trainval/TT6qWghHkFI/50008 WHEN I HAVE THAT NEW RELATIONSHIP I'LL BE HAPPY
trainval/TT6qWghHkFI/50009 I AM HERE TO BE A STUDENT AND A TEACHER OF A COURSE IN MIRACLES
trainval/TT6qWghHkFI/50010 AND I WENT TO MARIANE AND SAID HOW WOULD YOU SUGGEST I CARRY THIS MESSAGE TO MY GENERATION
trainval/TT6qWghHkFI/50011 ONE MOMENT AT A TIME WE EXPERIENCE WHAT THE COURSE REFERS TO AS THE HOLY INSTANT THE MOMENT THAT WE
trainval/TT6qWghHkFI/50012 THE HOLY INSTANT IS WHEN AN ANCIENT HATRED BECOMES A HOLY LOVE
trainval/TT6qWghHkFI/50013 THAT MOMENT WHEN ALL OF THAT ANGER AND THAT PAST RESENTMENT JUST DISAPPEARS IT GOES AWAY IT NO LONGER
trainval/TT6qWghHkFI/50014 EACH OF US AT SOME POINT IN TIME AND IN SOME WAY WE HAVE CHOSEN THAT TINY MAD IDEA AND AS THE COURSE SAYS
trainval/TT6qWghHkFI/50015 IT'S AN UNLEARNING OF THE NEGATIVITY OF THE LACK OF THE COMPARING OF THE SEPARATION
trainval/TT6qWghHkFI/50016 THE EGO WANTS US TO SEE EVERYONE AS SEPARATE
trainval/TT6qWghHkFI/50017 EGO WORKS IN SO MANY VICIOUS WAYS
trainval/TT6qWghHkFI/50018 THEN WE HAVE MORE VITALITY
trainval/TT6qWghHkFI/50019 THEN WE HAVE MORE HEALTH THEN WE HAVE MORE DIRECTION
trainval/TT6qWghHkFI/50020 WHEN WE OPEN UP TO THINK WITH LOVE AND WE ALLOW THE VOICE OF OUR INNER GUIDANCE SYSTEM TO COME FORWARD WE
trainval/TT6qWghHkFI/50021 BEFORE I CAME OUT HERE ON THE STAGE I SAID SOME PRAYERS WITH SOME OF MY SISTERS AND WE WERE IN THE BACK AND I SAID MAY ALL THE GODDESSES OF THE
trainval/TT6qWghHkFI/50022 EACH WOMAN ON THE STAGE TODAY HAD WILLINGNESS IN SOME FORM TO MAKE A CHANGE AND THAT'S WHY SHE IS WHO SHE IS TODAY
trainval/TT6qWghHkFI/50023 THE SECOND STEP IS A FOREGONE SURRENDER
trainval/TT6qWghHkFI/50024 LET GO OF YOUR PLANS
trainval/TT6qWghHkFI/50025 LET GO OF YOUR TIME CLOCK
trainval/TT6qWghHkFI/50026 WHEN WE HAVE FULL FAITH THAT WE CAN SHOW UP WITHOUT AN OUTLINE OR WE CAN HAVE FULL FAITH THAT WE
trainval/TT6qWghHkFI/50027 IF WE'RE NOT LIVING IN THAT FAITH THEN WHAT ARE WE DOING
trainval/tTb3d5cjSFI/50001 IT'S A BROAD APPROACH TO BEHAVIOR CHANGE THAT'S BEING USED TO HELP PEOPLE WITH ANXIETY DISORDERS WITH
trainval/tTb3d5cjSFI/50002 NOW TO UNDERSTAND WHY I WAS BLOWN AWAY YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE WORLD I LIVE IN
trainval/tTb3d5cjSFI/50003 VERY VERY ENCOURAGING
trainval/tTb3d5cjSFI/50004 SO WHAT THIS EXERCISE DID IS IT GAVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF SPACE BETWEEN ME AND MY THOUGHTS
trainval/tTb3d5cjSFI/50005 THAT WAS THE JUDGMENT THAT SHE FELT FROM PEOPLE WHEN SHE WOULD BE OUTSIDE SMOKING A CIGARETTE
trainval/tTb3d5cjSFI/50006 SO HERE IS THE SECRET TO SELF CONTROL
trainval/tTb3d5cjSFI/50007 THE SECRET TO SELF CONTROL IS TO GIVE UP CONTROL
trainval/tTcl5I0Wbzk/50001 I LOVE MOVIES
trainval/tTcl5I0Wbzk/50002 I LOVE VIDEO GAMES
trainval/tTcl5I0Wbzk/50003 THESE ARE INCREDIBLE THINGS
trainval/tTcl5I0Wbzk/50004 I LOVE IT I USE IT EVERYDAY
trainval/tTcl5I0Wbzk/50005 ONCE UPON A TIME YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER WHEN EDUCATION AND ENTERTAINMENT WERE ACTUALLY LOCATION BASED RIGHT
trainval/tTcl5I0Wbzk/50006 UNLIKE THIS ONE AND CLICK CLICK THAT CONTENT APPEARS ON SCREENS ALL AROUND THE WORLD JUST LIKE THAT
trainval/tTcl5I0Wbzk/50007 IDEAS WORTH SPREADING
trainval/tTcl5I0Wbzk/50008 SO WE TAKE 3
trainval/tTcl5I0Wbzk/50009 5 MINUTES TO ROTATE THOSE PEOPLE A 180 DEGREES UNTIL THOSE BLAST DOORS THOSE HEAVY DOORS
trainval/tTcl5I0Wbzk/50010 AND THAT REAL LIFE TRAGIC EVENT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE HAD ANY IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S
trainval/tTcl5I0Wbzk/50011 I LOVE VIDEO GAMES
trainval/tTcl5I0Wbzk/50012 I'VE GOT A CHOICE A AND B NOT ENOUGH CHOICES
trainval/tTcl5I0Wbzk/50013 I NEED A DOZEN BUTTONS I NEED TO DANCE AROUND THE ROOM
trainval/tTcl5I0Wbzk/50014 WHAT IS GOING ON HERE
trainval/tTcl5I0Wbzk/50015 THAT SUMS IT UP PERFECTLY
trainval/tTcl5I0Wbzk/50016 SOMETHING YOU CAN TEACH IN A SENTENCE OR LESS BUT WHICH ACTUAL EXPERTISE AT TAKES A LOT
trainval/tTcl5I0Wbzk/50017 AND YOUR NEXT PROJECT WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE MY ENCOURAGEMENT TO YOU IS IN WHATEVER INDUSTRY YOU WORK
trainval/tTcl5I0Wbzk/50018 I'M PLAYING A GAME I'VE GOT TO MAKE A DECISION
trainval/ttRhMPgpoOQ/50001 WHERE SHOULD I BE ROWING NOW
trainval/ttRhMPgpoOQ/50002 AND I LET GO OF SOMETHING INSIDE OF ME AND FELT RELIEVED
trainval/Ttshw4mELNk/50001 WE WORRY ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE THERE ARE
trainval/Ttshw4mELNk/50002 WE WORRY ABOUT HOW YOU CAN GET AWAY FROM PEOPLE
trainval/Ttshw4mELNk/50003 YOU ARE NOT TOLD ABOUT THE POPULATION SLOWING DOWN
trainval/Ttshw4mELNk/50004 YOU ARE NOT TOLD ABOUT HOW WE ARE LEARNING TO BEGIN TO WASTE LESS AND CONSUME LESS
trainval/Ttshw4mELNk/50005 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/tTvIEUGCigk/50001 CHINA BIGGEST IN THE WORLD 2
trainval/tTvIEUGCigk/50002 WE USED TO BE A NET EXPORTER OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND WE ARE NOW A NET IMPORTER OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
trainval/tTvIEUGCigk/50003 STATES CITIES AND COMMUNITIES NEED TO START THINKING LIKE THESE PROGRESSIVE COUNTRIES AROUND GREENHOUSE FARMING
trainval/tTvIEUGCigk/50004 THEY DRINK WATER MIXED WITH INORGANIC EARTH MINERAL MOLECULES
trainval/tTvIEUGCigk/50005 THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS ORGANIC PERRIER YOU KNOW
trainval/tTvIEUGCigk/50006 43000 SQUARE FEET THAT'S AN ACRE
trainval/tTvIEUGCigk/50007 IF WE CAN THINK DIFFERENT
trainval/tTvIEUGCigk/50008 I WAS CAPTIVATED
trainval/tTvIEUGCigk/50009 AFTER A YEAR OF PRODUCTION THEY'RE SOLD OUT
trainval/tTvIEUGCigk/50010 THEY HARVEST LETTUCE EVERY 28 DAYS
trainval/tTvIEUGCigk/50011 SELLING PRODUCE TO SOME OF THE FINEST RESTAURANTS IN TOWN
trainval/Tu01sNfs5SQ/50001 IT HAS TO HAPPEN IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH BIOLOGISTS
trainval/tUAepQYyMY4/50001 BUT AS WE ENVISIONED IT WE HAD THREE KEY GOALS PROVIDING WORLD CLASS LIFE SUPPORT AMBULANCE SERVICE
trainval/tUAepQYyMY4/50002 ALL SHE NEEDED WAS PERMISSION TO BUILD THREE STEPS TO HER HOUSE FROM GROUND LEVEL MAKING IT EASIER FOR HER TO ENTER AND
trainval/tUAepQYyMY4/50003 WHAT GIVES US THE COURAGE
trainval/TureGeSxSew/50001 90 PERCENT OF CANCERS ARE CURABLE IF CAUGHT IN STAGE ONE
trainval/TureGeSxSew/50002 95 PERCENT IN SOME CASES
trainval/TureGeSxSew/50003 IF WE CAN'T DO IT OURSELVES OR SEE IT BEING DONE YOU'RE HARD PRESSED TO MAKE US BELIEVE
trainval/TUtxSwC5mqA/50001 AND ON THE OUTSIDE YOU KNOW EVERYTHING WAS GOING GREAT
trainval/TUtxSwC5mqA/50002 AND SORT OF ALL SEEMED TO BE POINTING IN THAT ONE DIRECTION
trainval/TUtxSwC5mqA/50003 BECAUSE ON ONE HAND YOU KNOW IT WAS AMAZING
trainval/TUtxSwC5mqA/50004 IT WAS THE FULFILLMENT OF LITERALLY A LIFELONG DREAM
trainval/TUtxSwC5mqA/50005 THIS IS REALLY EXCITING
trainval/TUtxSwC5mqA/50006 WHEN I WAS RESEARCHING THIS EXPERIENCE I THOUGHT THIS IS LIKE A FOOTNOTE IN LIFE RIGHT
trainval/TUtxSwC5mqA/50007 AND I WANTED TO GET IN THE MINDSET OF WHAT THAT FELT LIKE BECAUSE I AM AN ACTOR AND I WANTED TO ACCESS THOSE EMOTIONS
trainval/TUtxSwC5mqA/50008 I PULLED UP A BUNCH OF THE EMAILS I'VE BEEN WRITING AT THAT TIME I FOUND THE ONE I WROTE TO MY AGENT WHEN I FINALLY HAD MADE THE DECISION AND SAID
trainval/TUtxSwC5mqA/50009 I DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THIS WILL BE PERMANENT
trainval/TUtxSwC5mqA/50010 I ACTUALLY TOOK PROFESSOR CHUN'S CLASS WHEN I WAS AT YALE
trainval/TUtxSwC5mqA/50011 PLEASE KNOW THAT IT IS NOT IMPULSIVE BUT COMES AFTER MANY MONTHS OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH MY LIFE
trainval/tV2RLLtOgL4/50001 MESSAGES IN VERBAL AND VISUAL AND EVEN TELEPATHIC FORMS THAT WERE HIGHLY CRITICAL OF HIM VERY UNPLEASANT
trainval/tV2RLLtOgL4/50002 THAT'S ALL WE CAN KNOW OF IT DIRECTLY
trainval/tV2RLLtOgL4/50003 EVERYTHING ELSE IS LOGICAL INFERENCE
trainval/tV2RLLtOgL4/50004 AND WE THEN HAVE TO IMAGINE WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THOSE
trainval/tV2RLLtOgL4/50005 AND PEIRCE POINTED OUT THAT ACTUALLY THIS IS ONE OF THE SHAKIEST MOST FRAGILE MOST TENUOUS FORMS OF LOGICAL INFERENCE THAT YOU
trainval/tV2RLLtOgL4/50006 TO ME ACTUALLY IT'S HIGHLY MEANINGFUL
trainval/tV2RLLtOgL4/50007 THE REASON IT'S MEANINGFUL TO ME IS I HAVE PRIOR EXPECTATIONS AND PRIOR KNOWLEDGE
trainval/tV2RLLtOgL4/50008 PERCEPTION IS AN ACTIVE PROCESS
trainval/tVIaoQrnAxY/50001 NOW I TELL YOU WHEN YOU GROW UP IN ISRAEL THESE STORIES THEY'RE NOT ONLY WORDS ON A
trainval/tVIaoQrnAxY/50002 MY BROTHER WAS ALWAYS THERE FOR ME WHEN I NEEDED HIM
trainval/tVIaoQrnAxY/50003 AND SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND SHE LED US INTO THE LIVING ROOM AND THERE ON A SOFA IN
trainval/tVIaoQrnAxY/50004 IF YOU STRIP THE WORD NEW OUT OF IT THE QUESTION THAT COMES TO ME
trainval/tVIaoQrnAxY/50005 I WANT TO BE THE LION
trainval/tVIaoQrnAxY/50006 IT S NOT A LIE
trainval/tVIaoQrnAxY/50007 NO OF COURSE IT'S A LIE
trainval/tVoE8eSu4bw/50001 I'M ASSUMING THAT WE ALL WANT TO LIVE HAPPY LIVES RIGHT
trainval/tvos4nORfSY/50001 SO IN YOUR COMPANIES YOU CAN'T KEEP TRACK OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL INVOICE AND SO YOU HAVE TO
trainval/twG4mr6Jov0/50001 SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AMYLOID PLAQUES ACCUMULATE TO THIS TIPPING POINT
trainval/twG4mr6Jov0/50002 NOW EVERYONE LOOK AT TWO PEOPLE
trainval/twG4mr6Jov0/50003 SO FAR WE HAVEN'T CHANGED OUR BRAIN'S DESTINY
trainval/twG4mr6Jov0/50004 A SINGLE NIGHT OF SLEEP DEPRIVATION LEADS TO AN INCREASE IN AMYLOID BETA
trainval/twG4mr6Jov0/50005 WE GAIN AND LOSE SYNAPSES ALL THE TIME THROUGH A PROCESS CALLED NEURAL PLASTICITY
trainval/twG4mr6Jov0/50006 IN SOME OF THESE BRAINS SCIENTISTS DISCOVERED SOMETHING SURPRISING
trainval/tWmJcRSxShc/50001 THIS ONE GENERATES NO IMAGERY AT ALL
trainval/tWmJcRSxShc/50002 DON'T BE TRENDY IF YOU WANT TO BE SERIOUS
trainval/tWmJcRSxShc/50003 MAYBE WHAT WANTS TO BE SAID IS THAT OLD AND THE NEW ARE LOCKED IN A DIALECTICAL EMBRACE A KIND OF DANCE WHERE EACH DEFINES THE
trainval/tWmJcRSxShc/50004 IS THIS THE KIND OF SIMPLE THAT LOOKS OBVIOUS OR THE KIND THAT LOOKS PROFOUND
trainval/TWPahtyJDsI/50001 I DIDN'T ALLOW THEM TO KNOW
trainval/TWPahtyJDsI/50002 THEIR STORIES RESONATE DEEP INSIDE OF ME AND I'M REASSURED THAT WE AREN'T SO ALONE IN THIS WORLD
trainval/twWkGt33XSk/50001 I REALIZED THEN THAT WE HAD TO THINK DEEPLY ABOUT HOW THE TECHNOLOGY WE WORK ON TODAY LOOKS IN FIVE
trainval/twWkGt33XSk/50002 ELON MUSK WARNS THAT IT'S AN EXISTENTIAL RISK AND ONE OF THE GREATEST RISKS THAT WE FACE AS A
trainval/TXaXvrd3jS4/50001 OR SO IT SEEMED
trainval/TXaXvrd3jS4/50002 AND I FOUND PEOPLE TO INTERVIEW THAT WOULD LEGITIMIZE MY CHOICE FOR ME AND TALK MORE ABOUT THE
trainval/TXaXvrd3jS4/50003 I CHANGED MY CHILDREN CHANGED
trainval/TXaXvrd3jS4/50004 AND WE MUST HAVE THE COURAGE TO MAKE THOSE CHOICES OVER AND OVER AGAIN THROUGHOUT OUR
trainval/txJGm6zhiBA/50001 THOUGH I COULD GO ON I'M NOT HERE TO SIMPLY TELL YOU ALL ABOUT MY STORY
trainval/txJGm6zhiBA/50002 IS IT JUST A COINCIDENCE THAT SCHOOL SYSTEMS AND STANDARDIZED TESTS ARE GETTING HARDER AND COLLEGE ACCEPTANCE RATES ARE GOING
trainval/txJGm6zhiBA/50003 OFTENTIMES CONVERSATIONS REGARDING MENTAL ILLNESSES SUCH AS DEPRESSION RESULT IN WORDS BEING THROWN AROUND THAT
trainval/txJGm6zhiBA/50004 SADNESS IS AN EMOTION THAT COMES AND GOES JUST AS HAPPINESS DOES
trainval/txJGm6zhiBA/50005 I ASKED MYSELF WHY I HAD IGNORED WHAT WAS GOING ON IN MY HEAD FOR SO LONG SIMPLY TO MAINTAIN THIS
trainval/txJGm6zhiBA/50006 THE BRIDGE TEAM CONSISTS OF AN ACADEMIC COORDINATOR WHO HAS THE WEIRDEST TASTE IN MUSIC LIKE THIS GUY IS EITHER LISTENING TO BOB
trainval/txJGm6zhiBA/50007 IT'S TIME TO FIGHT BACK
trainval/tXlNvlzd9M8/50001 NOT IS IT JUST VALUABLE
trainval/ty5QtslaAHM/50001 SO ONE SECOND FOR ONE SECOND OF COMPUTING
trainval/tYclUdcsdeo/50001 WE PREFERRED OPEN ENDED QUESTIONS
trainval/tYclUdcsdeo/50002 AND WE SUCCEEDED
trainval/tYclUdcsdeo/50003 SEBASTIAN'S TEACHING ANOTHER CLASS NOW
trainval/tYclUdcsdeo/50004 BUT TO ME THE MOST EXCITING PART OF IT IS THE DATA THAT WE'RE GATHERING
trainval/TYFH0DSjyqc/50001 BUT SOON THE QUEST FOR EXPLORATION BROUGHT ME TO THE FARTHEST CORNER OF THE PLANET SEARCHING FOR NEW POTENTIAL
trainval/TYFH0DSjyqc/50002 SO HOW CAN IT BE POSSIBLE
trainval/TYFH0DSjyqc/50004 AND IN FACT WE DISCOVERED IN THE CAVE A NEW MINERAL STRUCTURE FOR SCIENCE WHICH IS ROSSIANTONITE A PHOSPHATE
trainval/TYFH0DSjyqc/50006 THEY HAVE TO DO SCIENCE
trainval/TYFH0DSjyqc/50007 THEY HAVE A LOT OF TASKS
trainval/TYFH0DSjyqc/50008 YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT INDIGENOUS PEOPLE HAVE NEVER BEEN THERE
trainval/TYFH0DSjyqc/50009 SO WE HAD TO USE SPECIAL PROTOCOLS TO NOT CONTAMINATE THE ENVIRONMENT WITH OUR PRESENCE AND WE TRIED ALSO TO SHARE
trainval/TZkNJFrfdR8/50001 THAT'S NOT COMFORTABLE
trainval/TZkNJFrfdR8/50002 CROWDS ARE NOT A GOOD PLACE TO BE
trainval/TZkNJFrfdR8/50003 THEY ARE THE YOUNG BRAINS
trainval/TZkNJFrfdR8/50004 I'M RIGHT YOUR WRONG BLACK AND WHITE MISERABLIST
trainval/TZkNJFrfdR8/50005 I'LL GIVE 3 OR 4 EXAMPLES
trainval/TZkNJFrfdR8/50006 AND WHEN THEY HEAR OLD BRAINS TELLING JOKES ABOUT PAKIS QUEERS THEY JUST CRINGE
trainval/TZkNJFrfdR8/50007 ANOTHER WOULD BE COLLABORATION
trainval/TZkNJFrfdR8/50008 ANOTHER WOULD BE ADAPTABILITY
trainval/TZkNJFrfdR8/50009 GEN Y NAVIGATE AROUND IT
trainval/TZkNJFrfdR8/50010 AND THAT'S OLD BRAINS
trainval/TZy5Srsksls/50001 WE WENT TO SOME LIVE FIGHTS
trainval/TZy5Srsksls/50002 AND HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WORKING TOWARDS A DREAM
trainval/tZYkjaKNrSo/50001 AND THAT IS THE REASON WHY I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE DEFINED AS PUBLIC GOODS
trainval/tZYkjaKNrSo/50002 THERE IS NO INCENTIVE TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF YOUR PRODUCT
trainval/tZYkjaKNrSo/50003 THE ENDOWMENT WOULD CREATE INCOME THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO RUN THE OPERATION TO RUN THE RATING
trainval/tZYkjaKNrSo/50004 BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION WHO IS CULTIVATING THE ECONOMIC SOIL OF A COUNTRY
trainval/tZYkjaKNrSo/50005 IF OVER 70 PERCENT OF A COUNTRY'S POPULATION UNDER THE AGE OF 35 IS
trainval/tZYkjaKNrSo/50006 IT'S TIME TO GIVE THEM SOME COMPANY
trainval/tZYkjaKNrSo/50007 INCRA WOULD NOT ONLY RELEASE ITS RATINGS BUT IT WOULD ALSO RELEASE ITS INDICATORS AND
trainval/u0VHC1SDOS8/50001 COD FED MOST OF THE PEOPLE OF WESTERN EUROPE
trainval/u0VHC1SDOS8/50002 AND THAT'S EVERYWHERE
trainval/u0VHC1SDOS8/50003 INDUSTRIAL FISHING USES BIG STUFF BIG MACHINERY
trainval/u0VHC1SDOS8/50004 AND WHEN IT DIES IT FALLS TO THE BOTTOM AND THEN IT ROTS WHICH MEANS THAT
trainval/u0VHC1SDOS8/50005 AND THE ONLY FISHERY LEFT AND IT IS A COMMERCIAL FISHERY IS THE JELLYFISH FISHERY YOU SEE ON
trainval/u0VHC1SDOS8/50006 I THINK IT'S SORT OF FUNNY IT'S ON THE SIBERIAN COAST MAYBE THE RUSSIANS WILL CHARGE TOLLS
trainval/u0VHC1SDOS8/50007 THE MILITARY OF THE ARCTIC NATIONS IS TAKING IT REALLY SERIOUSLY
trainval/u0VHC1SDOS8/50008 BUT WHEN IT GETS TOO HOT THE ALGAE CAN'T MAKE THE SUGAR
trainval/u0VHC1SDOS8/50009 I MEAN BECAUSE WE AT THIS POINT WE CAN PROTECT IT
trainval/u0VHC1SDOS8/50010 IT'S NOT ABOUT THE FISH IT'S NOT ABOUT THE POLLUTION IT'S NOT ABOUT THE CLIMATE CHANGE
trainval/u0VHC1SDOS8/50011 THEN YOU SURE WON'T WANT TO EAT FISH THAT WERE RAISED IN IT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE A KIND OF GASTRONOMIC
trainval/u0VHC1SDOS8/50012 THE REALLY SCARY THINGS THOUGH ARE THE PHYSICAL CHEMICAL
trainval/u1K6hnm09xs/50001 FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS WE WENT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND EVEN VISITED REMOTE
trainval/u1K6hnm09xs/50002 THE COUNTRY WAS DIVIDED AGAIN SO MUCH THAT OUR PARLIAMENT RESIGNED WE
trainval/u1SdYypojbE/50001 I WAS SELF HARMING EVERY DAY
trainval/u1SdYypojbE/50002 DURING MY TEENAGE YEARS WHEN I WAS MOST DESPERATE SAMARITANS BECAME MY LIFELINE
trainval/u1SdYypojbE/50004 AND IT WAS A TOPIC OF SHAME AND NO ONE REALLY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT
trainval/u1SdYypojbE/50005 AND IT HAPPENS WHEN THERE'S A MISMATCH BETWEEN THE QUALITY AND THE QUANTITY OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE HAVE AND
trainval/u1SdYypojbE/50006 THAT'S SOMEONE WHO REALLY SEES US AS PART OF THE FAMILY
trainval/u1SdYypojbE/50008 AND PEOPLE GENERALLY ASK ME WHY
trainval/U1XJJxHIQwo/50001 AT THE AGE OF 11 I WAS COMPETING AT THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP
trainval/U1XJJxHIQwo/50002 I WAS CRYING PROBABLY CUSSING AT EVERYBODY AROUND
trainval/U1XJJxHIQwo/50003 I WAS JUST MAD YOU KNOW
trainval/U1XJJxHIQwo/50004 I SPENT ALL THIS TIME SEVEN YEARS TO THAT POINT DOING SOMETHING THAT I LOVED DOING SOMETHING THAT I
trainval/U1XJJxHIQwo/50007 YES YOU CAN BE THAT GUY DOING THAT THING MAKING THIS MONEY BUT WHAT DO YOU ACTUALLY
trainval/U1XJJxHIQwo/50008 BECAUSE THE THING YOU HAVE IN YOUR HAND IS WHAT YOU CAN MAKE INFLUENCE WITH
trainval/U23gPSGhW1w/50001 NOW KEEP THAT IN MIND AND THINK ABOUT THE CHILDREN OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN
trainval/U23gPSGhW1w/50003 I WAS SITTING THERE IN THE AUDIENCE LISTENING TO HIM AND HE SAID ABOUT PRISM AND OTHER INTELLIGENCE GATHERING
trainval/U23gPSGhW1w/50004 FACEBOOK IS A DREAM PLACE FOR SPIES
trainval/U23gPSGhW1w/50005 YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH THE SPY IS HAPPY
trainval/U2dHczVSCdo/50001 I AM ALSO A BLOGGER
trainval/U2dHczVSCdo/50002 SORT OF AND NOT REALLY
trainval/u2V0vOFexY4/50001 SO THERE IS THE PATTERN THAT EVERY ONE OF THEM HAD BUT THEY ALL WERE A LITTLE DIFFERENT TOO
trainval/u2V0vOFexY4/50003 WELL WHAT THE PROBLEM IS THIS TENDS TO CONCENTRATE THESE GENES
trainval/u2V0vOFexY4/50004 AND NOW THE BOYS AND THE GIRLS GET THEM
trainval/u2V0vOFexY4/50005 SO I THINK AFTER SEVERAL GENERATIONS AND HERE IS THE IDEA WE REALLY HAVE A TINDERBOX
trainval/u2V0vOFexY4/50006 BUT IT DOESN'T STOP THERE
trainval/u2V0vOFexY4/50007 BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE LIKE LIZZIE BORDEN LIKE THREE TIMES A CENTURY AND WE'RE KIND OF DUE
trainval/u2V0vOFexY4/50008 AND THEY ALL SEEMED TO BE OK
trainval/u2V0vOFexY4/50009 NOW THE ONLY PERSON IT TURNS OUT ONE SON AND ONE DAUGHTER SIBLINGS DIDN'T GET ALONG
trainval/u2V0vOFexY4/50010 THEY HAVE THE SAME BRAIN AND THE SAME EEG
trainval/u2V0vOFexY4/50011 AND NOW THEY ARE CLOSE AS CAN BE
trainval/u2V0vOFexY4/50012 BUT THERE'S GONNA BE BAD NEWS SOMEWHERE
trainval/u2V0vOFexY4/50013 AND WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING TO POP UP
trainval/u4iOeHXObok/50001 BUT YOU CAN'T BE JUST CREATIVE
trainval/U4Lx5rcii38/50001 NOW I'M NO FARMER
trainval/U4Lx5rcii38/50002 IT'S PRETTY COOL WHEN YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO STARTS A BAKERY
trainval/U4Lx5rcii38/50003 AND RETURNING VETERANS WHO PARTICIPATE IN FARM PROGRAMS ARE FINDING THAT THEY HAVE LOWER
trainval/U4Lx5rcii38/50004 I WANTED IT SO BADLY
trainval/U4Lx5rcii38/50005 IT IS MY DREAM JOB
trainval/U4Lx5rcii38/50006 BUT THAT'S FOR ANOTHER TALK
trainval/u4m65sbqbhY/50001 EARLY DETECTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION
trainval/u4m65sbqbhY/50002 THIS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT ONE OF THEM
trainval/u4m65sbqbhY/50003 1 MILLION LIVES EVERY YEAR IN THIS COUNTRY TO HEART DISEASE
trainval/u4m65sbqbhY/50004 THAT'S NOT EARLY INTERVENTION
trainval/u4m65sbqbhY/50005 WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE FACTS
trainval/u4m65sbqbhY/50006 BUT THIS TELLS US HOW WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT AND WHERE WE NEED TO GO
trainval/u4m65sbqbhY/50007 ARE WE GOING TO BE THERE SOON
trainval/u4m65sbqbhY/50008 BUT WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS AND BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGIES YOU HEAR ABOUT TODAY WE ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO BEGIN TO STRING THIS
trainval/u5GCetbP7Fg/50001 WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT ME HE SAID IT'S BLACK
trainval/u5GCetbP7Fg/50002 AND ONE OF THOSE DAYS MR
trainval/u5GCetbP7Fg/50003 BUT WE MUST TALK ABOUT IT ANYWAY
trainval/u5GCetbP7Fg/50004 WHAT COLOR IS IT
trainval/U5kIdtMJGc8/50001 IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME THAT IT WOULD BE APPLIED TO PHYSICS
trainval/U5kIdtMJGc8/50002 HERMANN MINKOWSKI HAD THIS GEOMETRY AND EINSTEIN REALIZED HEY
trainval/U5kIdtMJGc8/50003 I MEAN I THINK IT WAS PURE LUCK
trainval/U5kIdtMJGc8/50005 SO HOW DID YOU STAY AHEAD OF THE PACK
trainval/U5kIdtMJGc8/50006 I COULDN'T MAKE A BUSINESS OUT OF THAT
trainval/U5kIdtMJGc8/50008 WELL MORE THAN WE THINK
trainval/U5kIdtMJGc8/50009 JS WELL IT'S NOT JUST MATHEMATICAL
trainval/U5SyBjKKicA/50001 WE GOT MARRIED AND BECAME DOCTORS
trainval/U5SyBjKKicA/50002 I WAS WORKING AS AN INTERNIST AND PAUL WAS FINISHING HIS TRAINING AS A NEUROSURGEON
trainval/U5SyBjKKicA/50003 PAUL DIDN'T WANT A VENTILATOR AND CPR
trainval/U5SyBjKKicA/50004 AND I WAS LIKE WHOA I GUESS WE GET TO SAY ANYTHING OUT LOUD
trainval/U5SyBjKKicA/50005 I FELL IN LOVE WITH PAUL AS I WATCHED THE CARE HE TOOK WITH HIS PATIENTS
trainval/u70RZtCJSrI/50001 TWO WAYS TWO TONS
trainval/U7fFCaHZvVk/50001 IF WE ALL STARTED SAYING TO COMPANIES SHOW ME THE TRANSPARENT SUPPLY CHAIN TELL ME ABOUT THE LIVES AT
trainval/U7fFCaHZvVk/50002 IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE
trainval/u7SWcQaoaRQ/50001 AND MY FIRST FORAYS INTO BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH DOING DINOSAUR PALEONTOLOGY AS AN UNDERGRADUATE
trainval/u7SWcQaoaRQ/50002 THEY USE A SKELETON THAT WE CALL A HYDROSTATIC SKELETON
trainval/u7SWcQaoaRQ/50004 BECAUSE THERE WAS NO MECHANISM IN THIS EXPLANATION FOR MAKING THIS STRUCTURE HARD
trainval/u7SWcQaoaRQ/50005 AND NO ONE HAD SYSTEMATICALLY LOOKED AT THE WALL TISSUE
trainval/u7SWcQaoaRQ/50007 I'M NOT SURE THIS PROJECT'S GOING TO PAN OUT
trainval/u7SWcQaoaRQ/50008 BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID I WAS WALKING INTO A TRAP
trainval/u7SWcQaoaRQ/50009 AND THAT WAS BECAUSE EVERY HYDROSTATIC SKELETON THAT WE HAD FOUND IN NATURE UP TO THAT POINT HAD THE SAME BASIC
trainval/u7SWcQaoaRQ/50010 SO I WENT AHEAD COLLECTED WALL TISSUE PREPARED IT SO IT WAS ERECT SECTIONED IT
trainval/u7SWcQaoaRQ/50011 THEY'RE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE PENILE SKELETON
trainval/u7SWcQaoaRQ/50012 IF THE WALL AROUND THE ERECTILE TISSUE WASN'T THERE IF IT WASN'T REINFORCED IN THIS
trainval/u7SWcQaoaRQ/50013 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO CONTRIBUTE
trainval/u7SWcQaoaRQ/50014 AND I THOUGHT YEAH HE DOES HAVE A REALLY GOOD POINT HERE
trainval/U7y4GlmwPLQ/50001 IT TELLS US THAT LANDLOCKED COUNTRIES ARE CONDEMNED TO BE POOR THAT SMALL COUNTRIES CANNOT ESCAPE
trainval/U7y4GlmwPLQ/50002 NOW LET'S STOP AND THINK ABOUT IT FOR A MINUTE
trainval/U7y4GlmwPLQ/50003 THAT IS AS MANY AS THE NUMBER OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE HAVE
trainval/U7y4GlmwPLQ/50004 WE HAVE TAKEN ON SUCH ENORMOUS DEBTS SINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS BUT HAVE WE INVESTED THEM
trainval/U7y4GlmwPLQ/50005 CHINA AND JAPAN HAVE AN EVEN LONGER HISTORY OF RIVALRY AND HAVE BEEN DEPLOYING THEIR AIR FORCES AND NAVIES TO SHOW THEIR
trainval/u8bsCiq6hvM/50001 WELL EVERYBODY CAN THROW AROUND BIG NUMBERS
trainval/u8bsCiq6hvM/50002 AND SO THEY WERE GIVEN L DOPA AND THEIR SYMPTOMS DID IMPROVE BUT THEY WEREN'T TOTALLY ASYMPTOMATIC
trainval/u8bsCiq6hvM/50003 SO ON TOP OF L DOPA THEY GAVE THESE KIDS A SEROTONIN PRECURSOR DRUG AND THEY'RE EFFECTIVELY NORMAL NOW
trainval/u8bsCiq6hvM/50004 GUYS THIS WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING
trainval/u8bsCiq6hvM/50005 I'M IN SO MUCH PAIN
trainval/u8bsCiq6hvM/50006 IS THAT A BIG NUMBER
trainval/u8bsCiq6hvM/50007 SO MY FATHER'S FATHER WAS ONE OF 10 RESNICK BROTHERS
trainval/u8bsCiq6hvM/50008 THEY ALL HATED EACH OTHER AND ALL MOVED TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE PLANET
trainval/u8bsCiq6hvM/50009 NOT HARD TO IMAGINE
trainval/u8bsCiq6hvM/50010 MY COMPANY HAS SOFTWARE THAT DOES THIS RIGHT NOW
trainval/u8bsCiq6hvM/50011 BIGGER CLAN GATHERINGS AND SO ON
trainval/u8bsCiq6hvM/50012 BUT MAYBE IT'S A BAD THING AS WELL
trainval/U8XD0CcNhPU/50001 WE DON'T TRUST ANYBODY
trainval/U8XD0CcNhPU/50002 SO WE WENT BACK AND FORTH NEGOTIATING
trainval/U8XD0CcNhPU/50003 NIGHT PASSED NEXT MORNING HUNDREDS OF THE FARMERS FROM THAT COOPERATIVE WENT TO
trainval/U9BzgnX3z6Q/50001 AND IT OPENED ME UP TO A MUCH BROADER UNDERSTANDING OF
trainval/U9BzgnX3z6Q/50002 SO SPOKEN LANGUAGES ARE ORGANIZED SEQUENTIALLY WITH ONE SOUND FOLLOWING
trainval/U9BzgnX3z6Q/50003 OKAY SO THE WAY WE PROCESS INFORMATION WITH OUR EYES OR OUR EARS DEFINITELY
trainval/u9FSvAVQvGM/50001 BUT THE CAREER CHOICE STUCK
trainval/u9FSvAVQvGM/50002 I'M FAR FROM A HERO
trainval/u9FSvAVQvGM/50003 RIGHT AS YOU WALK IN THE DOOR YOU CAN TELL SOMEONE SMELLS BAD
trainval/u9FSvAVQvGM/50004 AT THE OUTSET I FOUND THE IDEA OF HOMELESS PEOPLE KIND OF LIKE THE INDIVIDUALS I MET IN THE
trainval/u9GEmyZ8B3Q/50001 AND LIKE A LOT OF OTHER FOLKS AT THE TIME I WAS FORCED OUT OF MY JOB AND INTO STARTING MY FIRST COMPANY
trainval/u9GEmyZ8B3Q/50002 LETS PUT IT THIS WAY
trainval/u9GEmyZ8B3Q/50003 I USED TO HAVE A LOVELY HEAD OF HAIR
trainval/u9GEmyZ8B3Q/50004 I HAVE THE LUXURY OF NOT JUST LOOKING AT MISTRUST FROM THE FOUR BUSINESSES THAT I HAVE STARTED BUT I AM AN
trainval/u9GEmyZ8B3Q/50005 THIS IS USUALLY YOU SOLVING A PROBLEM OR A PAIN
trainval/u9GEmyZ8B3Q/50006 EXECUTION IS THE MEASURABLE RESULT OF THE PLANNING THAT YOU'VE HAD IN PLACE TO SOLVE SOMEBODY'S PAIN OR
trainval/u9GEmyZ8B3Q/50007 LET'S GO BACK TO WHAT HEMINGWAY SAID ABOUT TRUSTING SOMEONE AS BEING THE BEST WAY TO TRUST THEM
trainval/u9hauSrihYQ/50001 I MEAN WHAT'S THE POINT
trainval/u9hauSrihYQ/50002 WHO CARES WHY THINGS ARE CREEPY
trainval/u9hauSrihYQ/50003 THEY JUST ARE
trainval/u9hauSrihYQ/50004 EVERYONE WANTS TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES
trainval/u9hauSrihYQ/50005 I'VE LEARNED AS MUCH ABOUT IT AS I CAN
trainval/u9hauSrihYQ/50006 IT'S OFTEN CALLED THE THEORY OF MIND AND IT IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO SHOW THAT ANIMALS HAVE SUCH A THING
trainval/u9Lu85L111Y/50001 I SAID I WORK WITH THE CONVERSATIONAL NATURE OF REALITY
trainval/u9Lu85L111Y/50002 AND WHEN YOU GET TO SANTIAGO ACTUALLY IT CAN BE SOMETHING OF AN ANTICLIMAX BECAUSE
trainval/u9Lu85L111Y/50003 THE FIRST RITUAL IS TO EAT A TAPAS PLATE OF SCALLOPS OR IF YOU'RE
trainval/u9Lu85L111Y/50004 SO REALLY THIS FIRST RITUAL IS SAYING HOW DID YOU GET TO THIS PLACE
trainval/u9Lu85L111Y/50005 SHE SAID I BURNED A LETTER AND TWO POSTCARDS
trainval/u9Lu85L111Y/50006 I SAID ASTONISHING
trainval/u9Lu85L111Y/50007 TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD AND YOU HAVE PAPER
trainval/u9Lu85L111Y/50008 BUT IT'S QUITE ASTONISHING HOW LITTLE TIME WE SPEND AT THIS CONVERSATIONAL FRONTIER
trainval/u9Lu85L111Y/50009 AND ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES ABOUT WALKING INTO YOUR LIFE ABOUT COMING INTO THIS
trainval/u9Lu85L111Y/50010 I'M SORRY YOU HAVE CHOSEN THEM OUT UNCONSCIOUSLY FOR THAT EXACT CORE
trainval/u9Lu85L111Y/50011 YOU LOOK AT PARENTING YEAH
trainval/u9Lu85L111Y/50012 TO BREAK YOUR HEART
trainval/u9Lu85L111Y/50013 BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO ASK FOR HELP
trainval/u9Lu85L111Y/50014 THE MOST POWERFUL MOMENT I HAD ON THE WHOLE CAMINO WAS WHEN I REALIZED I MYSELF
trainval/uaB6Bdgp3WU/50001 THIS IS WHAT I FOUND OUT
trainval/uaB6Bdgp3WU/50002 I DISCOVERED THAT THERE'S A MOVEMENT FOR A BETTER WAY
trainval/uaB6Bdgp3WU/50003 I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT ME MY BROTHER AND SISTER ACTUALLY LIKE EATING BAKED KALE CHIPS
trainval/uaB6Bdgp3WU/50004 I TRY TO SHARE THIS EVERYWHERE I GO
trainval/uaJSNRAkr5I/50001 IT'S TIME TO RE CONNECT WITH WATER
trainval/uaJSNRAkr5I/50002 ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN
trainval/uBgRo9tnvSI/50001 HOW MANY PEOPLE WANT IT
trainval/uBgRo9tnvSI/50002 AND ASK YOURSELF
trainval/uBgRo9tnvSI/50003 AN UNCONDITIONAL BASIC INCOME CREATES A HUGE INCENTIVE TO CREATE BETTER WORK
trainval/uBgRo9tnvSI/50004 BUT IT'S A MORE EQUAL FLOOR
trainval/uBgRo9tnvSI/50005 WE HAVE TO RENEW IT
trainval/uBgRo9tnvSI/50006 THAT'S THE PRINCIPLE SO THERE ARE MANY DETAILS
trainval/uBgRo9tnvSI/50007 NO IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE
trainval/uBgRo9tnvSI/50008 WE HAVE A FEW WEEKS TIME TO DISCUSS LATER
trainval/uBgRo9tnvSI/50009 IT'S NOT NEW BUT IT IS A STEP IN HISTORY AND IT'S AS DIFFICULT AS IT WAS TO
trainval/uBsiYBrFtbY/50001 I WANT TO DO A SPEECH
trainval/uBsiYBrFtbY/50002 DON'T PUT SO MUCH WORK ON YOURSELF
trainval/UbVZ7rmDYrc/50001 THE REAL ISSUE IS FEAR
trainval/UbVZ7rmDYrc/50002 JUDGE MARGARET H
trainval/UbVZ7rmDYrc/50003 OPENNESS GENERATES PUBLIC ACTIVISM AND PUBLIC ACTIVISM GENERATES POLITICAL
trainval/UbVZ7rmDYrc/50004 YOU HAVE ALREADY ACHIEVED A MAJORITY IN THE NORTHERN IRELAND ASSEMBLY
trainval/UbVZ7rmDYrc/50005 COMING OUT NOT ONLY MAKES OUR LIVES TRANSPARENT AND ALLOWS US TO
trainval/uCC3dS7FrkQ/50001 MY MOTHER WELL MOM
trainval/uCC3dS7FrkQ/50002 LESS IS MORE
trainval/UCFg9bcW7Bk/50001 IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO MENTION THESE ARE NOT MY ORIGINAL IDEAS I STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS
trainval/UCFg9bcW7Bk/50002 LEWIS WROTE ABOUT IT IN HIS BOOK THE FOUR LOVES
trainval/uDIyxxayNig/50001 IT'S A DELIGHT TO BE HERE I THINK THESE EVENTS ARE VERY IMPORTANT
trainval/uDIyxxayNig/50002 TEACHING PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR BRAIN MADE THEM FAR MORE EFFECTIVE AT WHATEVER THEY WANTED TO ACHIEVE
trainval/uDIyxxayNig/50003 I WAS VERY SURPRISED BY THAT IT WASN'T WHERE I'D EXPECTED I WOULD END UP
trainval/uDIyxxayNig/50004 ONE THING I DISCOVERED IS GREAT IDEAS DON'T SPREAD BY THEMSELVES QUITE OFTEN THEY NEED A
trainval/uDIyxxayNig/50005 CASE IN POINT BEING
trainval/uDIyxxayNig/50006 IF YOU NOTICED YOU HAVE THEM MAYBE WHEN YOU'RE SWIMMING DOING LAPS
trainval/uDIyxxayNig/50007 WELL IT'S NOT THE WATER BUT MANY PEOPLE MAKE THIS FALSE CORRELATION AND MANY OTHER FALSE
trainval/uDIyxxayNig/50008 THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF RESEARCH IN THERE QUITE SURPRISING HOW LIMITED IT IS
trainval/uDIyxxayNig/50009 THE THIRD THING IS WHEN YOU SUPPRESS EMOTIONS OTHER PEOPLE'S BLOOD PRESSURE GOES UP
trainval/uDIyxxayNig/50010 IT ACTUALLY CREATES A THREAT RESPONSE IN OTHER PEOPLE WHICH IS QUITE SURPRISING
trainval/uDIyxxayNig/50011 REAPPRAISAL FOR EXAMPLE MIGHT BE YOU'RE HAVING AN ARGUMENT WITH SOMEONE AND YOU ACTUALLY MANAGE TO SEE THE SITUATION
trainval/uDIyxxayNig/50012 YOU KNOW HOW THAT IS
trainval/uDIyxxayNig/50013 I HELP LEADERS AND MANAGERS IN MOSTLY LARGE ORGANIZATIONS MAKE BETTER
trainval/uDIyxxayNig/50014 IT'S QUITE SURPRISING
trainval/uDIyxxayNig/50016 WHAT HAPPENS IN ORGANIZATIONS IS MANY MANAGERS ACCIDENTALLY DO ALL THE WRONG THINGS THEY TELL PEOPLE WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING
trainval/uDIyxxayNig/50017 I HAD DINNER LAST WEEK WITH ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE MINDFULNESS MOVEMENT VERY IMPORTANT FIGURE DANIEL SIEGEL AND HE WAS
trainval/uDIyxxayNig/50018 BUT WE'VE HARDLY MADE ANY IMPROVEMENTS IN HOW WE RELATE TO EACH OTHER IN 30 50 100 YEARS
trainval/uDIyxxayNig/50019 AND I THINK IT'S TIME TO PUT SOME FOCUS ON THAT AND REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE THERE
trainval/uDIyxxayNig/50020 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/uDIyxxayNig/50021 I WAS IN CHICAGO LAST WEEK TALKING TO SOMEONE FROM A LARGE ORGANIZATION AND SHE WAS KIND OF LAUGHING AT HERSELF AND I
trainval/udNJCRSABvw/50001 WE HAVE A GOOD TIME
trainval/udNJCRSABvw/50002 JAZZ IS LIKE A LANGUAGE
trainval/udNJCRSABvw/50003 WE ARE TAKING CHANCES WHEN WE PLAY
trainval/udNJCRSABvw/50004 THAT WAS THE BEST AUDIENCE I EVER HAD
trainval/udNJCRSABvw/50006 SO TALKING ABOUT JAZZ DEMOCRACY
trainval/udNJCRSABvw/50007 SO EVEN WE JAZZ PLAYERS ALTHOUGH I STATED ALL THE GOOD STUFF AND THE GOOD WAY OF
trainval/udNJCRSABvw/50008 AND THEN YOU SEE THE OTHER GUY
trainval/UdsUVjeJuPE/50001 HE CALLS IT DELIBERATE PRACTICE
trainval/UdsUVjeJuPE/50003 HARD DOES NOT EQUAL BORING
trainval/UdsUVjeJuPE/50004 MATH WAS VERY BORING AS MOST OF YOU WOULD PROBABLY AGREE
trainval/UdsUVjeJuPE/50005 ONE OF THEM IS CALLED A DOPAMINE LOOP
trainval/UdsUVjeJuPE/50006 DOPAMINE IS THE SUBSTANCE THAT YOU GUYS ALL CRAVE
trainval/UdsUVjeJuPE/50007 BY THE TIME THEY GOT TO A MORE ADVANCED STAGE IT GOT EVEN MORE EXCITING
trainval/UDXtFbSmBAg/50002 THERE'S NO SINGLE RECIPE THAT WILL INCREASE YOUR HAPPINESS AT ALL TIMES AND FOR
trainval/UDXtFbSmBAg/50003 TELL ME MORE AND WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
trainval/UDXtFbSmBAg/50005 THREE SIMPLE WORDS YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW
trainval/ue2ZEmTJSXo/50001 WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT AN IMPACT
trainval/ue2ZEmTJSXo/50002 BUT IF YOU'RE AN ALIEN RACE WHO DOESN'T KNOW ANY OF THIS DOESN'T HAVE ANY CONCEPT OF EARTH INTELLIGENCE YOU'D BE
trainval/ue2ZEmTJSXo/50003 IN COSMOLOGY FOR EXAMPLE THERE HAVE BEEN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THREADS OF EVIDENCE THAT
trainval/ue2ZEmTJSXo/50004 AND YOU OBSERVE A REALLY STRANGE EFFECT
trainval/ue4L8kmaKXQ/50001 IT WAS ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS TO DO TRYING TO BE A MOTHER AND WATCH THEM GROW UP WITHOUT HER
trainval/ue4L8kmaKXQ/50002 EDUCATION WAS IMPORTANT TO HER
trainval/ue4L8kmaKXQ/50003 SHE WOULD SACRIFICE HER CHILDHOOD TO CARE FOR HER FAMILY
trainval/ue4L8kmaKXQ/50004 AT THE AGE OF 12 SHE QUIT SCHOOL
trainval/ue4L8kmaKXQ/50005 HOW CAN DISCIPLINE BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT ANY CONSEQUENCES
trainval/ue4L8kmaKXQ/50006 ALWAYS A SMILE
trainval/ue4L8kmaKXQ/50007 SHE IS PRODUCTIVE AND SHE GIVES BACK EVERYDAY
trainval/ue4L8kmaKXQ/50008 REHABILITATION IS WHAT YOU NEED TO CHANGE
trainval/ue4L8kmaKXQ/50009 I HAVE LEARNT SO MUCH FROM HER
trainval/ue4L8kmaKXQ/50010 SHE'S MADE A DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES INCLUDING MINE
trainval/ue4L8kmaKXQ/50011 WHEN SHE SAW ME SITTING THERE BY MYSELF 19 YEARS AGO SHE CAME UP AND TALKED TO ME
trainval/ue4L8kmaKXQ/50012 WE BECAME FRIENDS THAT DAY AND WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS FROM THAT DAY TILL NOW
trainval/ue4L8kmaKXQ/50013 SHE LIVES BY THAT EVERYDAY
trainval/ue4L8kmaKXQ/50014 WITH THE FOUNDATION SHE HAS CREATED FOR HERSELF IT'S UP TO HER TO KEEP THAT FOUNDATION STRONG BY
trainval/uebxlIrosiM/50001 DEATH IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE OFTEN DISCOURAGED TO TALK ABOUT OR EVEN THINK ABOUT BUT I'VE REALIZED THAT
trainval/uEkgM9P2C5U/50001 AND LIFESPANS INCREASED IMMEDIATELY DRAMATICALLY AND WE LIKE TO SAY THE PLANNERS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REPEAT THAT
trainval/uEkgM9P2C5U/50002 AND IT'S DEFINED AS BEING WALKABLE
trainval/uEkgM9P2C5U/50003 THERE ARE LOTS OF SMALL STREETS
trainval/uEkgM9P2C5U/50004 EACH ONE IS COMFORTABLE TO WALK ON
trainval/uEkgM9P2C5U/50005 SO WHEN WE LOOK AT A DOWNTOWN AREA AT A PLACE THAT HAS A HOPE OF BEING WALKABLE AND MOSTLY THAT'S OUR DOWNTOWNS IN AMERICA'S
trainval/uEkgM9P2C5U/50006 AND THERE ARE SO MANY MOVING PARTS THAT ADD UP TO A WALKABLE CITY
trainval/uEkgM9P2C5U/50007 HOW WIDE ARE THEY
trainval/uEkgM9P2C5U/50008 THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
trainval/uEkgM9P2C5U/50009 AND HERE YOU KNOW THIS STREET
trainval/uEkgM9P2C5U/50010 NOTHING INTERESTS US MORE THAN OTHER PEOPLE
trainval/uEkgM9P2C5U/50011 WE WANT SIGNS OF PEOPLE
trainval/UeKZYCq3s0E/50001 IT CAN PREVENT THINGS LIKE THIS
trainval/UeKZYCq3s0E/50002 WHEN MILLIONS OF CHILDREN EACH AND EVERY DAY ARE BECOMING ORPHANS OF HIV AND AIDS
trainval/ueOqYebVhtc/50001 I FINISHED MY QUEST I GOT THE GIRL
trainval/ueOqYebVhtc/50002 WHY ARE YOU STILL STANDING THERE
trainval/ueOqYebVhtc/50003 THE MOVIES ARE VERY VERY FOCUSED ON DEFEATING THE VILLAIN AND GETTING YOUR REWARD AND THERE'S NOT A LOT OF ROOM
trainval/ueOqYebVhtc/50004 THERE'S NO MODELS FOR THEM
trainval/ueOqYebVhtc/50005 I RECOMMEND IT TO ALL OF YOU
trainval/ueOqYebVhtc/50006 DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT THE CRITICS SAID WHEN BRAVE CAME OUT
trainval/ueOqYebVhtc/50007 AW I CAN'T BELIEVE PIXAR MADE A PRINCESS MOVIE
trainval/ueOqYebVhtc/50008 IT HAS NOT YET CAUGHT ON AND CAUGHT FIRE BUT MAYBE TODAY WE WILL START A MOVEMENT
trainval/ueOqYebVhtc/50009 OSCAR BUZZ DOING GREAT AT THE BOX OFFICE A CONSENSUS IDEA OF WHAT A QUALITY
trainval/ueOqYebVhtc/50010 IT PRETTY MUCH FLUNKS THE BECHDEL TEST
trainval/ueOqYebVhtc/50011 THEY'RE THROWING IT UP IN THE AIR
trainval/ueOqYebVhtc/50012 SO OUR SONS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND SOME WAY OF ADAPTING TO THIS SOME NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH EACH OTHER AND I THINK
trainval/ueOqYebVhtc/50013 MAYBE IT'S NOT JUST THE SPARKLY DRESS
trainval/uFIc7XEVyM0/50001 I THINK ABOUT THAT WOMAN EVERY YEAR ON MY BIRTHDAY
trainval/uFIc7XEVyM0/50003 MY OBSESSION WITH HELPING BEGAN FOR PURELY SELFISH REASONS
trainval/uFIc7XEVyM0/50005 THEY COULDN T STOP AND SOMEHOW CAME TO TERMS WITH HIS PASSING MUCH MORE QUICKLY
trainval/uFIc7XEVyM0/50006 I NEVER WANTED TO TALK ABOUT MY 30 YEARS WITH AN EATING DISORDER BECAUSE I WAS EMBARRASSED
trainval/uFIc7XEVyM0/50007 PHYSICALLY SHE RECOILED
trainval/uFIc7XEVyM0/50008 YOU KNOW I CHANTED AFFIRMATIONS LIKE A MAD WOMAN
trainval/uFIc7XEVyM0/50010 SELF ESTEEM IS GOOD
trainval/uFIc7XEVyM0/50011 THEN ONCE YOU VE LEARNT TO BE KINDER TO YOURSELF YOU CAN LOOK FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO BE OF SERVICE TO {NS}
trainval/uFIc7XEVyM0/50012 HOW S YOUR HYPHEN
trainval/uFIc7XEVyM0/50013 BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO ANXIETY MOST OF US ACROSS THE GLOBE SHARE THE SAME TWO FEARS
trainval/uFIc7XEVyM0/50014 THE FEAR THAT WE RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH AND THE FEAR THAT WE WON T HAVE ENOUGH
trainval/uFIc7XEVyM0/50015 LOOKING FOR THE FUNNY IN THE FATAL WAS CERTAINLY MY SALVATION
trainval/uFIc7XEVyM0/50016 BUT TO SOMEONE WITH HIGH ANXIETY EVERY DAY CHALLENGES CAN SEEM LIKE A LIFE AND DEATH SITUATION
trainval/uFIc7XEVyM0/50017 AND SHE SAID
trainval/uFIc7XEVyM0/50018 NO ONE IS PROMISED TOMORROW
trainval/uFIc7XEVyM0/50019 BUT MAYBE START WITH YOURSELF
trainval/ufp5iGh0agA/50001 THE TWO OF US WOULD SPEND HOURS TRYING TO PUT IT TOGETHER WHILE WE CHATTED COMFORTABLY
trainval/ufp5iGh0agA/50002 THEIR REASONS WERE VARIED BUT THEIR REASONS WERE VERY REAL
trainval/ufp5iGh0agA/50003 THEY NEEDED WHAT THOSE WOMEN COULD BRING TO THE TABLE
trainval/ufp5iGh0agA/50004 MAKE IT IN ANY ONE OF FIVE FOCUS AREAS
trainval/ufp5iGh0agA/50005 WHEN I ARRIVED I GOT TO EAT ALL OF MY FAVORITE FOODS
trainval/ufp5iGh0agA/50006 THEY ARE MORE CONFIDENT
trainval/ufUkAQOQaXU/50001 OKAY SO WHAT
trainval/ufUkAQOQaXU/50002 THIS HAS LITERALLY REVOLUTIONIZED COGNITIVE SCIENCE
trainval/ufUkAQOQaXU/50003 IT'S IN ITS EARLY STAGES AND IT'S CRUDE BY SOME MEASURES BUT IN FACT 20 YEARS AGO WE WERE AT NOTHING
trainval/ufUkAQOQaXU/50004 EVERYONE IS INTERESTED IN OTHER PEOPLE
trainval/ufUkAQOQaXU/50005 YOU COULDN'T DO HEALTHY PEOPLE
trainval/ufUkAQOQaXU/50006 AND NOW WE HAVE A NEW EXPERIMENTAL PREP HUMAN BEINGS
trainval/ufUkAQOQaXU/50007 EVERYONE HAS RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND THEY'RE INTERESTED IN THESE RELATIONSHIPS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS
trainval/ufUkAQOQaXU/50008 DRUGS OF ABUSE WOULD COME IN AND THEY WOULD CHANGE THE WAY YOU VALUE THE WORLD
trainval/ufUkAQOQaXU/50009 NO OTHER SPECIES CAN DO THAT
trainval/ufUkAQOQaXU/50011 THESE SAME VALUATION SYSTEMS ARE REDEPLOYED WHEN WE'RE VALUING INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PEOPLE
trainval/ufUkAQOQaXU/50012 THEY KEEP YOU ALIVE
trainval/ufUkAQOQaXU/50013 THE OTHER AREA IS CALLED BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS
trainval/ufUkAQOQaXU/50014 AND WE STEAL THEIR GAMES
trainval/ufUkAQOQaXU/50015 WHY IS THAT
trainval/ufUkAQOQaXU/50016 AND WE CAN USE THAT TO SORT OF CARVE UP THE BEHAVIOR
trainval/ufUkAQOQaXU/50017 HERE'S THE COOL THING
trainval/ufUkAQOQaXU/50018 IT WAS AT THE TIME IN HOUSTON TEXAS
trainval/ufUkAQOQaXU/50019 THAT'S AN UNFAIR OFFER AND YOU KNOW WHAT AN UNFAIR OFFER IS
trainval/ufUkAQOQaXU/50020 THAT IS WE EXPLOIT THE FACT THAT THE HEALTHY PARTNER PLAYING SOMEBODY WITH MAJOR DEPRESSION OR PLAYING
trainval/ufUkAQOQaXU/50021 THIS IS THE KIND OF GAME DONE BY MY LAB AND MANY AROUND THE WORLD
trainval/UG2zHhgfAW0/50002 HE SAID THAT IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE FAMILY
trainval/UG2zHhgfAW0/50003 BUT IT DEFINITELY DIDN'T DO THAT
trainval/UG2zHhgfAW0/50004 I WAS ONLY CALLED ONE NAME ALL DAY IT WASN'T THAT BAD
trainval/UG2zHhgfAW0/50005 IT WILL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING
trainval/UGtFXtnWME4/50001 PUSHED THE BUTTON AND THE STORY WENT UP ONLINE
trainval/UGtFXtnWME4/50002 10 OF TWEETS DURING THAT HOUR CONCERNED HER DEATH
trainval/UGtFXtnWME4/50003 THAT'S 20 MILLION PEOPLE SPEAKING ABOUT AN EVENT BEFORE A SINGLE NEWS ORGANIZATION HAS PUBLISHED
trainval/UGtFXtnWME4/50004 TAKING A BIT OF TIME
trainval/UGtFXtnWME4/50005 SPEAKING TO SOME PEOPLE
trainval/UGtFXtnWME4/50006 GETTING SOME PROPER QUOTES
trainval/UGtFXtnWME4/50007 IN 2012 EL PA S SACKED ALMOST A 1 3 OF ITS EDITORIAL STAFF
trainval/UGtFXtnWME4/50008 BUT OF COURSE THEY ARE NOT ALONE
trainval/UGtFXtnWME4/50009 IF YOU'VE CHECKED EVERY FACT
trainval/UGtFXtnWME4/50010 IF YOU HAVE REVISITED EVERY QUOTE
trainval/UGtFXtnWME4/50011 IT'S A RECIPE FOR DISASTER
trainval/UGtFXtnWME4/50012 THAT'S AN INCREASE FROM 3
trainval/UGtFXtnWME4/50013 2 TO 1 JUST 10 YEARS AGO
trainval/UGtFXtnWME4/50014 IT SPENDS TIME WITH THE COMMUNITY GETS TO KNOW THEIR STORIES
trainval/UGtFXtnWME4/50015 SOMETIMES IT'S WHOLE STORIES THEMSELVES
trainval/UGtFXtnWME4/50016 THERE WAS BLANKET COVERAGE
trainval/UGtFXtnWME4/50017 THE WORLDS MEDIA DESCENDED ON THIS TOWN
trainval/UGtFXtnWME4/50018 WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE MINERS OF SOMA
trainval/UGtFXtnWME4/50019 WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SURVIVORS OF THE MV SEWOL IN KOREA
trainval/UGtFXtnWME4/50020 WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN CAME UP AGAINST MANY OBJECTIONS AND MANY OBSTACLES ALONG THE WAY
trainval/UGtFXtnWME4/50021 THE TREMOR OCCURRED AT 9
trainval/UGtFXtnWME4/50023 THERE'S SOMETHING VERY STRANGE ABOUT THIS STORY
trainval/UGtFXtnWME4/50024 I'LL GIVE YOU A CLUE
trainval/UGtFXtnWME4/50025 THIS SORT OF THING IS HAPPENING MORE AND MORE
trainval/UGtFXtnWME4/50026 IF YOU ARE PESSIMIST YOU MIGHT SAY
trainval/UGtFXtnWME4/50027 HERE IS MY VIEW
trainval/uH0aihGWB8U/50001 NOW BATMAN I WILL ACCEPT
trainval/uH0aihGWB8U/50002 BATS ARE COOL
trainval/uH0aihGWB8U/50003 WHAT DO YOU HAVE THAT WE DON'T HAVE
trainval/UhC2U8VFgB4/50001 I STILL REMEMBER THAT FEELING OF ASTONISHMENT AND SURPRISE LIKE I HAVE BEEN TO INDIA FOR THE FIRST
trainval/uHnqvhWQMV0/50001 BECAUSE AS WE LOOK AT THESE CHANGES THAT ARE FACING US AND WE CAN SEE THEM IN CLIMATE
trainval/uHnqvhWQMV0/50002 AND IT SET ME IN MOTION FOR WHAT IS NOW ALMOST TWO DECADES OF RESEARCH ABOUT HOW SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION
trainval/uHnqvhWQMV0/50003 THEY TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50001 IF WE LOOK AT CULTURES AROUND THE WORLD EVERY CULTURE READS STORIES
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50002 THEY'RE MORE THAN JUST MYTHS LEGENDS AND FABLES
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50003 THEY ARE THE ORAL TEXTBOOKS OF THE CULTURE DESIGNED TO IMPART WISDOM SPIRITUALITY
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50004 BUT WHAT IF WE WERE ALREADY GIVEN THE MAP TO HAPPINESS BUT LIFE GOT IN THE WAY AND WE FORGOT
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50005 IT'S NOT ABOUT FINDING A HANDSOME PRINCE
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50006 I MEAN HE REALLY WAS JUST A MINOR CHARACTER IN ALL OF THE FAIRY TALES
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50007 HE WAS THE OUTCOME OF HAPPINESS NOT THE SOURCE
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50008 AND SECONDLY IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING A PRINCESS
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50009 I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS BUT WE SEEM TO WEAR IT LIKE A BADGE OF HONOR
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50010 BUT NOWADAYS THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT WE CAN BE SO THE PRINCESS REALLY IS AN IDEOLOGY
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50011 ALTHOUGH IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WE WERE COMFORTABLE WITH AS WOMEN IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE LEARNED AND WE
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50012 HAVE WE REALLY JUST SET UP THESE SERIES OF EXPECTATIONS FOR OURSELVES AND WHO'S JUDGING US
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50013 IT IS GOING TO TAKE GENERATIONS TO CHANGE
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50014 THE REALITY IS IN THE DECADE TODAY IT'S NOT GOING TO CUT IT
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50015 FOR ME WHEN I FIRST GOT THE JOB I'M IN AT THE MOMENT THE CHANCELLOR CAME UP TO ME BEFORE I STARTED AND SAID
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50016 I THOUGHT OH MY GOD MAYBE HE'S RIGHT
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50017 THIS ORGANIZATION IS A LOT BIGGER THAN ANY I'VE EVER WORKED FOR MAYBE I NEED TO BE MORE SERIOUS
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50018 OF COURSE I TURN UP TO THE WORK ON THE FIRST DAY WITH THIS INTENTION TO BE MORE SERIOUS AND BY LUNCHTIME I WAS
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50019 THE GOOD THING IS THAT SMILING ACTUALLY HAS SOME GREAT BENEFITS
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50020 IT'S GOT HEALTH BENEFITS
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50021 IT LOWERS ANXIETY IT LOWERS STRESS IT IMPROVES YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM BY INCREASING YOUR WHITE BLOOD CELLS
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50023 IT'S REALLY NICE ISN'T IT
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50024 FOR ME I THINK WE MAY HAVE LOST SIGHT OF WHERE IT ALL STARTED
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50025 YOU FEEL GOOD THEY FEEL GOOD
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50026 BUT I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT TANGIBLE GIVING
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50027 IT'S NOT ABOUT MAKING PEOPLE FEEL BAD TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER BECAUSE THAT'S ONLY SHORT TERM
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50028 IT'S ABOUT MAKING OTHER PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50029 YOU KNOW THIS PERSON IN THE WORKFORCE
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50030 THEY'RE ALWAYS MISERABLE IT'S ALWAYS SOMEONE ELSE'S FAULT THEY'RE REALLY CONFRONTATIONAL AND THEY'RE ALWAYS THE VICTIM
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50032 THEY COULD BE SO MUCH MORE IF THEY JUST CONSIDERED PEOPLE AROUND THEM
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50033 SHE WAS NOT LOOKING FOR ANYTHING MORE THAN SHE HAD
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50034 SHE WAS VERY VERY CONTENT
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50035 I HEARD OF A STORY RECENTLY WHICH I THINK IS A REALLY GOOD DEPICTION OF THIS
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50036 HE SAID TO THE FISHERMAN HOW MANY FISH DID YOU CATCH
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50037 HE SAID JUST A FEW
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50039 IF WE LOOK AT SNOW WHITE SHE HAD TO CLEAN THE HOUSE OF SEVEN STINKY COAL MINERS AND AS WE ALL KNOW IT'S HARD ENOUGH
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50040 THEY WERE PROUD ABOUT WHAT THEY DID SO SOMETIMES WE NEED TO STOP LOOKING FOR EXTERNAL VALIDATION
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50041 WE ALL KNOW THE SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50042 IF YOU NEVER THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE HAPPY YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE HAPPY
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50043 I MEAN WHEN THE PRINCE FOUND THE GLASS SLIPPER CINDERELLA DIDN'T RACE TO THE PALACE DEMANDING TO
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50044 THE EVIL QUEEN HOWEVER RESORTED TO POISONING SNOW WHITE TO TRY AND GET HER HAPPY ENDING WHICH WE
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50045 SO SOMETIMES TRYING TO FORCE YOURSELF OFF YOUR PATH CAN ACTUALLY PUT YOU ONTO THE WRONG
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50046 AND AS WE ALL KNOW THERE ARE ONLY TWO THINGS GUARANTEED IN LIFE
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50047 THERE'S A BOOK OUT AT THE MOMENT CALLED THE FIVE REGRETS OF DYING BY AUSTRALIAN AUTHOR BRONNIE WARE
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50048 BRONNIE WAS A PALLIATIVE CARE NURSE SO THESE AREN'T HER REGRETS OF DYING
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50049 THESE ARE THE REGRETS SHE HEARS FROM HER PATIENTS AT THEIR HOUR OF DEATH
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50050 THE FIRST REGRET
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50051 I WISH I'D LET MYSELF BE HAPPIER
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50052 THE SECOND ONE
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50053 WHEN I WAS IN MY 20S A REALLY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH TERMINAL CANCER AND I WAS LIVING AWAY
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50054 BUT I CAME HOME AND I SAW HIM SHORTLY BEFORE HE DIED
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50055 ALL I WANTED TO DO IS TELL HIM HOW MUCH I LOVED HIM AND WHAT AN AMAZING FRIEND HE WAS
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50056 I DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS AND IT'S HAUNTED ME EVER SINCE
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50057 AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT I BLAME
trainval/uHRG3Vr9qyI/50058 I BLAME TIME
trainval/uHs2Auz5s6w/50001 INSTEAD OF VIEWING CLOUDS AS AN OBSTRUCTION TO A CLEAR SKY I ENCOURAGE US ALL TO ACKNOWLEDGE
trainval/uHs2Auz5s6w/50002 MY PATH WAS CLEARLY MARKED I HAD TO PERFECT ENRICH AND EXPRESS MYSELF IN A WORK OF ART THAT WOULD
trainval/uHs2Auz5s6w/50003 WHEN I CAME ACROSS THIS QUOTE BY SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR MEMORIES CAME FLOODING BACK TO ME
trainval/UIAm1gSVgn0/50001 MOST DAYS MY NAME IS WAITRESS AT MY FAMILY'S DAMASCUS RESTAURANT FULL TIME
trainval/UIAm1gSVgn0/50002 I WILL TAKE YOU FROM KUALA LUMPUR TO BARCELONA TO BEIRUT
trainval/UiCJhSuLdok/50002 MOST PEOPLE THINK IT IS MAJORITY OF RULE
trainval/UiCJhSuLdok/50003 IF THIS WERE ADOPTED AS THE INTERNATIONAL DEMOCRATIC NORM THERE WOULD BE NO FURTHER
trainval/UiDJFGroD3U/50001 SURROUNDED BY TEMPTATION BOBBY SIMPLY COULD NOT STAY AWAY FROM THE LADIES FOR MORE THAN A FEW DAYS BEFORE HE MANAGED
trainval/UiDJFGroD3U/50002 AT FIRST THAT FEELS LIKE A MUCH NEEDED BREAK AND KIND OF LIKE A RELIEF BUT IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG BEFORE KAREN
trainval/UiDJFGroD3U/50003 THE THERAPIST'S THERE TO WORK WITH KAREN TO REBUILD HER SELF CONFIDENCE AND GIVE HER THE PUSH THAT SHE NEEDED WHILE THE EMPLOYMENT
trainval/UiDJFGroD3U/50004 WHY DID IT WORK
trainval/UiDJFGroD3U/50005 LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
trainval/UiDJFGroD3U/50006 THE WAY YOU AND I COPE WITH OUR LIVES IS HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY OUR MINDS
trainval/UiDJFGroD3U/50007 KAREN HAD A SUPERVISOR WHO MADE HER FEEL THAT THE JOB SHE DID WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH
trainval/UiDJFGroD3U/50008 I'VE PRESENTED ONE STRATEGY TODAY THAT WE KNOW IS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING SICK LEAVE BY TACKLING THE UNDERLYING PROBLEMS
trainval/UiDJFGroD3U/50009 THE PHILOSOPHY BEHIND THIS APPROACH IS THAT EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO WORK CAN WORK AS LONG AS YOU FIND A GOOD MATCH
trainval/Uieh3RfkCng/50001 WE PICK THOSE WORDS OUT
trainval/UiosQf4GqnQ/50001 AUDIENCE GIVE ME A NO WAY
trainval/UiosQf4GqnQ/50002 VANISHING COKE TRICK
trainval/UiosQf4GqnQ/50003 WHY AM I A MAGICIAN
trainval/UiosQf4GqnQ/50004 FIRST OFF BEFORE I ANSWER THAT CAN WE JUST ACKNOWLEDGE HOW HARD IT IS TO BE A MAGICIAN IN 2013
trainval/UiosQf4GqnQ/50005 ARMANDO IS GOING TO PERFORM A TRICK
trainval/UiosQf4GqnQ/50006 DENTED CAN UNDENTED OPEN CAN NOW SEALED
trainval/UiosQf4GqnQ/50007 IMAGINE THE EMPTINESS THE VOID THE VACUUM
trainval/UiosQf4GqnQ/50008 YOU JUST SAID THAT
trainval/UJ7QaCFbizo/50001 I HAD BEEN SO CAUGHT UP IN THE VISUALS AND MY OWN GOOD FEELINGS ABOUT THIS THAT I HAD COMPLETELY
trainval/UJ7QaCFbizo/50002 IN FACT IT INFORMED THE WHOLE REST OF MY CAREER
trainval/UJ7QaCFbizo/50003 WE FEEL SORRY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE BROKEN AND NEED FIXING AND WE FEEL CHARITABLE WHEN WE
trainval/UJ7QaCFbizo/50004 WE DESIGN SPECIAL SERVICES FOR SPECIAL KIDS
trainval/UJ7QaCFbizo/50005 YOU MIGHT SEE YOUR OWN PERSPECTIVE REFLECTED IN ONE OF THESE MODELS OR YOU MIGHT BE THINKING THAT YOU'VE NEVER EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT
trainval/UJ7QaCFbizo/50006 I WAS WALKING IN THE MALL ONE NOVEMBER DAY AND I SAW THIS POSTER FOR A SPECIAL PHOTO SESSION WITH SANTA
trainval/UJ7QaCFbizo/50007 I KNOW THESE EVENTS ARE HAPPENING IN MALLS ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY AND I BET MOST PEOPLE FEEL PRETTY GOOD ABOUT THEM
trainval/UJ7QaCFbizo/50008 I MEAN THAT SEEMS LIKE A NICE THING TO DO RIGHT
trainval/UJ7QaCFbizo/50009 AS SOMETHING FRAGILE BROKEN AND SPECIAL OR AS PEOPLE WHO HAVE
trainval/UJv5B7s1DdE/50001 EVERYTHING WENT ON WELL
trainval/UJv5B7s1DdE/50002 NOW WORLD IMAGINE
trainval/uJZWcKOIZMo/50001 BUT DON'T GET ME WRONG THERE'S A LOT ABOUT BEING 13 THAT I DO NOT MISS
trainval/uJZWcKOIZMo/50002 AND I'M SURE WE'VE ALL FELT MOMENTS LIKE THAT
trainval/uJZWcKOIZMo/50003 SO WHY ALL THE NEGATIVE CONNOTATION WITH NOSTALGIA
trainval/uJZWcKOIZMo/50004 IT'S OKAY TO GO BACK THERE AS LONG AS YOU DON'T GET STUCK THERE
trainval/uKByBgqxOw4/50001 YOUR INTUITION MIGHT TELL YOU THAT TOO
trainval/uKByBgqxOw4/50002 SOME OF THESE WILL SOUND FAMILIAR BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY ARE THINKING THAT WAY
trainval/uKByBgqxOw4/50003 IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE WORKED ON AND A FEW OTHER PEOPLE AND IT INDICATES A KIND OF HIERARCHY ALONG WITH SOME ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HOW MANY
trainval/uKByBgqxOw4/50004 THIS EXPERIMENT'S BEEN DONE MANY MANY TIMES
trainval/uKByBgqxOw4/50005 YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO LOOK AT BRAIN ACTIVITY AND SAY THIS PERSON'S GOING TO BE A GOOD POKER PLAYER OR THIS PERSON'S SOCIALLY NAIVE AND WE MIGHT ALSO
trainval/uKByBgqxOw4/50006 THEY PLAY LOTS OF TRIALS WITH DIFFERENT AMOUNTS EACH TIME
trainval/uKByBgqxOw4/50007 THIS GOES BACK QUITE A WAYS
trainval/uKByBgqxOw4/50008 THEY'RE INTERESTED IN WORKING MEMORY
trainval/ukgnU2aXM2c/50001 HOW CAN ONE THING ONE TECHNOLOGY BE APPLIED TO SOMETHING ELSE IN THE WORLD
trainval/ukgnU2aXM2c/50002 SO IN OTHER WORDS BY VIRTUE OF HAVING PERSPECTIVE WE LACK PERSPECTIVE
trainval/ukgnU2aXM2c/50003 JUST BY THINKING ABOUT THE PROBLEM DIFFERENTLY AND BY ASKING A LOT OF QUESTIONS
trainval/ukgnU2aXM2c/50004 BUT HOW COULD MY ELECTRONIC DEVICES HARNESS THIS ENERGY
trainval/ukgnU2aXM2c/50005 WHY HADN'T SOMEBODY ELSE THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE
trainval/ukgnU2aXM2c/50006 AND THIS WAS A VERY DAUNTING PROSPECT CONSIDERING MY SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND WAS AT THE UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL
trainval/UkLWzSxAQJU/50001 WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL I WAS SO PASSIONATE IN ART AND DESIGN THAT EVERY TIME MY TEACHER TURNED HER
trainval/UkLWzSxAQJU/50002 THIS IS A PICTURE OF THE COMPLEX THAT CONTROLS THE MOVEMENT OF THE CELL
trainval/ukS8T7p2WMQ/50001 WE NEED TO BE CONSCIOUS OF IT
trainval/ukS8T7p2WMQ/50002 WE NEED TO BE AWARE
trainval/ukS8T7p2WMQ/50003 WE NEED TO HELP THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE SUFFERING
trainval/ukS8T7p2WMQ/50004 I DON'T HAVE THE SOLUTION TO BREAKING DOWN THE STIGMA BUT I DO NEED TO STRESS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS
trainval/ukS8T7p2WMQ/50005 DEPRESSION IS LIKE A PARASITE
trainval/UlDWRZ7IYqw/50001 I STILL BARELY UNDERSTAND WHAT MOST SCIENTISTS ARE TALKING ABOUT
trainval/ulLFP8axZVQ/50001 AND THEN THEY WOULD GO HOME DEAL DRUGS AND SHOOT PEOPLE
trainval/ulLFP8axZVQ/50002 THIS WAS NOT THE POINT
trainval/ulLFP8axZVQ/50003 THIS BECAME THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF OUR WORK
trainval/ulLFP8axZVQ/50004 SHOW UP AT ROCA READY TO PARTICIPATE AND WE WILL SHOW YOU THE DOOR
trainval/ulLFP8axZVQ/50005 WE BRUSH OFF THE F YOU S AND FIND THEM EVEN WHEN THEY ARE HIDING FROM US
trainval/ulLFP8axZVQ/50006 WE DON'T REALLY PUT A GPS IN YOUR DRINK BUT WE WILL GO FOR YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN
trainval/ulLFP8axZVQ/50007 SOME YOUNG PEOPLE ARE IN SUCH DANGEROUS GANG SITUATIONS THEY CAN'T EVEN COME IN TO PROGRAMMING
trainval/ulLFP8axZVQ/50008 SO WE TRACK THEM AND WE TRACK OURSELVES AND FIGURE OUT IF ANYTHING WE DO IS OF HELP
trainval/ulLFP8axZVQ/50009 IF THE EVALUATOR SAYS WE'RE SUCCESSFUL IN FIVE YEARS THEN THE GOVERNMENT PAYS AND THE INVESTORS GET
trainval/ulLFP8axZVQ/50010 WHEN HARVARD DUG INTO OUR NUMBERS IT SHOWED THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE AT ROCA REDUCED RECIDIVISM BY
trainval/ulLFP8axZVQ/50011 LAST NIGHT I WAS IN THE PARK WITH MY GIRL AND THIS GUY LOOKED AT ME FROM ACROSS THE PARK
trainval/ulLFP8axZVQ/50012 AND JOE WENT ON TO SAY WHEN I WAS SITTING THERE WAITING FOR MY FRIEND AND I THOUGHT
trainval/ulLFP8axZVQ/50013 AND WE'D BETTER BE RELENTLESS AND DRIVE EACH OTHER CRAZY UNTIL WE GET IT RIGHT
trainval/ulLFP8axZVQ/50014 THEY ARE OUR CHILDREN
trainval/ulLFP8axZVQ/50015 OUR LATEST OBSESSION IS TEACHING YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR EMOTIONS AND HOW TO MANAGE THEM SO THEY CAN
trainval/ultonpeO0ZA/50001 IN MY YEARS TOILING AWAY IN LABS AND IN PEOPLE'S BACKYARDS INVESTIGATING AND CATALOGING THE
trainval/ultonpeO0ZA/50002 MY GOAL IS NOT TO FIND TECHNOLOGY TO KILL THE NEW MICROSCOPIC LIFE AROUND US
trainval/ulYR5bpu68E/50001 IT'S AN AIR THAT OPERATES QUITE A LOT LIKE A LIQUID
trainval/uM1Ygy0tSp0/50001 SO THEY USE POST ITS OR EXCEL OR FACEBOOK
trainval/uM1Ygy0tSp0/50002 AFTER A LAMPPOST FLEW BY MY FAMILY AND I SPRINTED INTO THE BASEMENT
trainval/uM1Ygy0tSp0/50003 IN A DISASTER HOWEVER YOU START WITH ALL OF THE INTEREST AND NONE OF THE CAPACITY
trainval/uM1Ygy0tSp0/50004 AND YOU'VE ONLY GOT ABOUT SEVEN DAYS TO CAPTURE 50 PERCENT OF ALL OF THE WEB SEARCHES THAT WILL EVER BE MADE TO HELP YOUR
trainval/uM1Ygy0tSp0/50005 THEN SOME SPORTING EVENT HAPPENS AND YOU'VE GOT ONLY THE RESOURCES THAT YOU'VE COLLECTED THUS FAR TO MEET THE NEXT FIVE YEARS OF
trainval/uM1Ygy0tSp0/50006 BUT WHO KNOWS THAT
trainval/uM1Ygy0tSp0/50007 AS WE WATCHED THEY BECAME FRUSTRATED AND LEFT TO GO FIND SOMEBODY TO HELP ON THEIR OWN
trainval/uM1Ygy0tSp0/50008 YOU SENT ME TO THAT PLACE ON WASHINGTON STREET YESTERDAY AND NOW I'M COVERED IN POISON IVY
trainval/uM1Ygy0tSp0/50009 AND WHY NOT ME
trainval/uM1Ygy0tSp0/50010 I'M A CAMPAIGN ORGANIZER
trainval/uM1Ygy0tSp0/50011 I'M GOOD AT FACEBOOK
trainval/uM1Ygy0tSp0/50012 THE POINT IS IF THERE'S A FLOOD OR A FIRE OR A HURRICANE YOU OR SOMEBODY LIKE YOU ARE GOING TO STEP
trainval/uM1Ygy0tSp0/50013 IN A COUNTRY LIKE OURS WHERE WE BREATHE WI FI LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY FOR A FASTER RECOVERY SHOULD BE A NO
trainval/uM1Ygy0tSp0/50014 WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE SAME TRANSFORMATION IN TEXAS AND IN ALABAMA
trainval/uM1Ygy0tSp0/50015 SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON
trainval/uM1Ygy0tSp0/50016 WE'RE WORKING ON GETTING THE SOFTWARE TO PLACES SO PEOPLE EXPECT IT SO PEOPLE KNOW HOW TO USE IT AND SO IT CAN BE FILLED AHEAD OF TIME WITH THAT
trainval/umgWcQ5uNu0/50001 I WAS IN SOUTH AFRICA WITH MR
trainval/umgWcQ5uNu0/50002 WE HAD EIGHT TIGER SHARKS
trainval/UMSWdzT6rV8/50001 THEY WORK A NINE HOUR DAY AND TRAVEL TWO HOURS TO GET THERE AND BACK
trainval/UMSWdzT6rV8/50002 APPARENTLY THIS IS QUITE NORMAL
trainval/Un2yBgIAxYs/50001 GRANDPA TAUGHT ME ABOUT THE QUIET AND COHESIVE WAYS OF THE WOODS AND HOW MY FAMILY WAS KNIT INTO
trainval/Un2yBgIAxYs/50002 I WENT TO MY FIRST BAG WITH THE BIRCH
trainval/Un2yBgIAxYs/50003 I RAN MY GEIGER COUNTER OVER ITS LEAVES
trainval/Un2yBgIAxYs/50004 I PULLED OFF ITS BAG
trainval/Un2yBgIAxYs/50005 YOU CAN CHECK THEM OUT
trainval/Un2yBgIAxYs/50006 SO NOW I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE SCIENCE
trainval/UN8S8qSKmdE/50003 AND I FELT LIKE THE ONLY WAY TO ACHIEVE NORMALITY WAS TO NOT BE ILL ANY MORE TO NOT
trainval/UN8S8qSKmdE/50004 BECAUSE WE ALL ARE HUMAN WE ALL STRUGGLE
trainval/UN8S8qSKmdE/50005 WHAT WHAT WHAT
trainval/UN8S8qSKmdE/50006 WHICH HE CONSIDERED DISGUSTING
trainval/UN8S8qSKmdE/50007 AND I WAS FED UP OF ALWAYS BEING ON THE EDGE ALWAYS BEING THE ONE DOING THOSE WEIRD
trainval/UN8S8qSKmdE/50008 WHAT IF YOU'RE THE PIONEER
trainval/UN8S8qSKmdE/50009 WHAT IF YOU'RE THE TRAILBLAZER
trainval/UN8S8qSKmdE/50010 IT'S NOT A BADGE OF HONOR
trainval/UN8S8qSKmdE/50011 IF I HAD BEEN SPENDING MY ENERGY TRYING TO FIT IN I WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE AN ADVOCATE FOR WOMEN
trainval/UN8S8qSKmdE/50012 OR PERHAPS IT'S ALCOHOLISM OR FAMILY DYSFUNCTION OR POVERTY OR HOMOPHOBIA IS SOMETHING
trainval/UN8S8qSKmdE/50013 WE WITH THE BROKEN BITS
trainval/uNDWvejza4c/50001 A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL THAT PULLED ME INTO AN INVESTIGATION AND
trainval/uNDWvejza4c/50003 THE RESPONSE WAS AN IMMEDIATE DENIAL
trainval/uNDWvejza4c/50004 AND HE HAD A SUGGESTION WHY OUR DATA WAS WRONG
trainval/uNDWvejza4c/50005 HE SAID WELL THOSE DOG OWNERS THEY PROBABLY ARE LYING ABOUT THE DOG FOOD THAT THEY FEED
trainval/uNDWvejza4c/50006 THE MAIN GOAL WAS TO FIND THE TOXIN
trainval/uNDWvejza4c/50007 THE PEOPLE ON TOP THE ONES THAT MAKE DECISIONS DIRECTORS AND MINISTERS DID NOT WANT TO CONTINUE THIS
trainval/uNDWvejza4c/50008 WHAT KIND OF WORLD WAS THIS
trainval/unNRCSj0igI/50001 WE WANT TO PUT IT OUT IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND WE WANT IT TO BE POWERED BY THE SUN
trainval/unNRCSj0igI/50002 AND WE DON'T USE DESIGN ANYMORE
trainval/unNRCSj0igI/50003 WE FIND WHAT WORKS
trainval/uNQujCwCu88/50001 YOU FEEL GREAT
trainval/uNQujCwCu88/50002 I CERTAINLY LEARNED IT TWICE
trainval/uNQujCwCu88/50003 THE FIRST TIME WHEN IT TOOK ME FIVE MONTHS FROM THE DECISION OF
trainval/uNQujCwCu88/50004 WELL WE LIVE IN THE ECONOMY THAT IS BASED ON DISTRACTION
trainval/uNQujCwCu88/50005 WE NEED TO GIVE UP ON THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE TO BE CONNECTED OR ACCESSIBLE 24 7
trainval/uNQujCwCu88/50006 THIS WAY YOU ARE IN CHARGE OF WHERE YOU'RE GETTING INFORMATION AS OPPOSED TO BEING
trainval/uNQujCwCu88/50008 FOR EXAMPLE A STUDY BY HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL THAT SAID THAT CONSULTANTS KNOWLEDGE
trainval/uNQujCwCu88/50009 BECAUSE YOUR BRAIN STILL NEEDS THE EXCITEMENT OF DOPAMINE
trainval/uNQujCwCu88/50010 WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH ALL THIS FREE TIME THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU WILL HAVE AVAILABLE
trainval/unSnvLgyf3o/50001 THEN A VOICE GOING PUSH THROUGH PUSH THROUGH PUSH THROUGH PUSH THROUGH
trainval/unSnvLgyf3o/50003 THIS CONCEPT OF MASTERY WHICH WE'RE SOLD TO IN THE WEST WHICH I'M GOING TO GO BACK INTO IN A MINUTE
trainval/unSnvLgyf3o/50004 AND THE FOURTH ONE IS I HAD TO UNDERSTAND THE PATH TO HAPPINESS LIES IN DETACHMENT
trainval/unSnvLgyf3o/50005 WOULDN'T WE BE SHORT CHANGING OURSELVES IF WE DIDN'T PUSH THROUGH
trainval/unSnvLgyf3o/50006 AT THE PRICE OF YOUR HEALTH
trainval/unSnvLgyf3o/50007 AT THE PRICE OF YOUR MIND
trainval/unSnvLgyf3o/50011 SO I'VE BEEN BACK A FEW MONTHS NOW IN THE UK
trainval/unSnvLgyf3o/50012 AND I WEAR THIS OUTFIT NOT BECAUSE I AM A MASTER IN KUNG FU FAR FROM IT BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT IT
trainval/uo7w3g24DWo/50002 SO I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PHENOMENON WHICH IS BEHIND WHAT ALREADY SEEMS TO BE A
trainval/uo7w3g24DWo/50003 WELL PEOPLE POWER HAS BEEN THERE FOR A WHILE
trainval/uo7w3g24DWo/50004 SO WHAT'S NEW IN IT
trainval/uo7w3g24DWo/50005 AND EVERYBODY WAS AMAZED WHEN THE REFRIGERATOR OPENED AND MILLIONS OF YOUNG MAINLY SECULAR
trainval/uo7w3g24DWo/50006 HOW LONG WAS MUBARAK IN POWER
trainval/uo7w3g24DWo/50007 AND CAN YOU LOOK AT THE AGE OF THE PEOPLE ON THE STREETS OF EUROPE
trainval/uo7w3g24DWo/50008 NOW AT THE END NONVIOLENT DISCIPLINE
trainval/uo7w3g24DWo/50009 AND THIS IS PROBABLY THE GAME CHANGER
trainval/uo7w3g24DWo/50011 IT'S ONLY 200 OF US IN THIS ROOM
trainval/uo7w3g24DWo/50012 BUT WHAT IF WE ORGANIZED THE SPRAYING OF GRAFFITI THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT ALL OVER KRAKOW
trainval/uo7w3g24DWo/50013 YOU HAVE THE FEAR HIGH YOU HAVE STATUS QUO
trainval/uo7w3g24DWo/50014 HUMOR IS SUCH A POWERFUL GAME CHANGER AND OF COURSE IT WAS VERY BIG IN POLAND
trainval/uo7w3g24DWo/50015 BUT HERE IS ALSO THE BAD NEWS
trainval/uo7w3g24DWo/50016 NOW WHAT DO THE STATISTICS HAVE
trainval/uo7w3g24DWo/50017 OF COURSE YOU COULD BET THEY DID THE MOST STUPID THING
trainval/uo7w3g24DWo/50018 AND YOU CAN ALWAYS USE HUMOR
trainval/UoBUXOOdLXY/50001 YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY INTERACTS WITH PEOPLE
trainval/UoBUXOOdLXY/50002 IT'S JUST IT'S DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE THIS
trainval/UoBUXOOdLXY/50003 EVERY MORNING I WAKE UP AND I LOOK AT ALL THE STUFF THAT GOOGLE ALERTS SENDS ME AND IT'S JUST AMAZING
trainval/UoMpbLSFsig/50001 IF THE INFLATIONARY CONSEQUENCES OF USING SDRS IN THIS WAY ARE BENIGN
trainval/UOn3zOp8JPE/50001 THEY HAD HIGHER STANDARDIZED TEST SCORES THEY WERE MORE LIKELY TO GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE THEY HAD HAPPIER MARRIAGES
trainval/UOn3zOp8JPE/50002 SO I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU ABOUT OUR EXPERIMENTAL STUDY ON HANGRY
trainval/UOn3zOp8JPE/50003 AND THEY DO THIS TASK 25 TIMES SO WE CAN GET A MORE RELIABLE MEASURE OF AGGRESSION
trainval/UOn3zOp8JPE/50004 THE STUDY WAS ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF GLUCOSE ON AGGRESSION
trainval/UOn3zOp8JPE/50005 AND WE EXPLAINED THIS TO PARTICIPANTS AFTER THE STUDY WAS OVER
trainval/UOn3zOp8JPE/50006 WE LIKE IT A LOT BECAUSE IT'S AN OBJECTIVE MEASURE YOU CAN COUNT THE NUMBER OF PINS BETWEEN 0 AND
trainval/UOn3zOp8JPE/50007 NOW THE NOISE IS A COMBINATION OF NOISES THAT MANY PEOPLE REALLY HATE LIKE FINGERNAILS
trainval/UOo13qXVdy4/50001 WE WORK TOGETHER BOTH ON A MODEST PROPOSAL DANCE TO PHD TODAY
trainval/UoruUSrndBA/50001 I LEARNED TO GET OVER MYSELF
trainval/UoruUSrndBA/50002 I HOPE THAT'S THE PERSPECTIVE YOU'LL TAKE WITH YOU TODAY CAUSE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE AN AMAZING ARRAY OF
trainval/UoruUSrndBA/50003 ENJOY THIS EVENT
trainval/UoruUSrndBA/50004 HE WAS THOUGHTFUL
trainval/UoruUSrndBA/50005 AND HE SAID
trainval/UoruUSrndBA/50006 I DIDN'T WANT IT TO HAPPEN BUT IT DID
trainval/UoruUSrndBA/50007 BUT YOU'RE ALSO BRIGHT AND YOU KNOW NOT EVERYONE DOES
trainval/UoruUSrndBA/50008 HALF THE TEAM SHOWED
trainval/UoruUSrndBA/50009 AND THAT'S WHERE THE TRAGEDY STARTS
trainval/UoruUSrndBA/50010 THE SAME HALF A TEAM SHOWED UP ALMOST TO A PERSON AND THE SAME GUY GAVE DAVE THE SAME
trainval/UoruUSrndBA/50011 I BROKE THROUGH
trainval/UoruUSrndBA/50012 HE SAID WHEN I REALIZED THAT AND A NEW LENS CLICKED IN PLACE I SAW SOMETHING RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF ME
trainval/UoruUSrndBA/50013 IT HAD BEEN THERE EVERY DAY BUT I MISSED IT EVERY DAY UNTIL NOW
trainval/uOrZF8FdtLc/50001 OUR TEACHER TAUGHT US ETIQUETTE ON HOW TO ASK SOMEONE TO
trainval/UoXSYihVSew/50001 AND THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT THE POLICIES THAT YOU ATTACH TO THAT CONTENT
trainval/uP3pg3alCRw/50002 PEOPLE FOUND NEW WAYS TO USE OLD BUILDINGS
trainval/uP3pg3alCRw/50003 THERE ARE STILL GREAT GRANDPARENTS ALIVE OF SCHOOL CHILDREN TODAY WHO COULD BE INTERVIEWING MAKING
trainval/uP3pg3alCRw/50004 GO OUT OF HERE YOU ARE IN A BAROQUE OR RENAISSANCE CITY
trainval/uP3pg3alCRw/50005 CAN YOU BE HEARD
trainval/uP3pg3alCRw/50007 BECAUSE HE'S JOLLY MUCH BETTER THAN THE CHAMP WE HAVE
trainval/uP3pg3alCRw/50008 AND HOW DO WE LEARN TO EMPATHIZE
trainval/uP3pg3alCRw/50009 HAVE YOU BEEN TO A MUSEUM TO SEE HOW PEOPLE USED TO BE
trainval/uP3pg3alCRw/50011 THAT'S NOT REALLY THE WAY TO GET INTO PEOPLES MINDS IS IT
trainval/uP3pg3alCRw/50013 AND IF YOU GO OUT HERE INTO CRACOW YOU WILL SEE CHURCHES THAT ARE IDENTICAL TO CHURCHES YOU'LL
trainval/uP3pg3alCRw/50015 THIS IS A BRAVE NEW WORLD
trainval/uP3pg3alCRw/50016 TO ADD TO WE SHOULD HAVE PHOTOGRAPHS WE SHOULD HAVE COMPETITIONS FOR HOW TO SAVE THE HOUSE WHAT
trainval/up4hFjSjcTY/50001 THEY CALLED OFFICES
trainval/up4hFjSjcTY/50002 THEY CHECKED SCHEDULES
trainval/up4hFjSjcTY/50003 THEY WERE MEETING WITH SECRETARIES
trainval/up4hFjSjcTY/50004 WE COULD WALK THERE
trainval/up4hFjSjcTY/50005 AND SO WE CHOSE TO LOOK AT PAUL RUSESABAGINA AS AN EXAMPLE OF A GENTLEMAN WHO
trainval/up4hFjSjcTY/50006 IT'S THE FIRST TIME WE'D DONE THIS
trainval/up4hFjSjcTY/50007 AND I ASKED THEM TO PUT THEIR OWN VOICE OVER IT
trainval/up4hFjSjcTY/50008 GO FIGURE IT OUT
trainval/up4hFjSjcTY/50009 THE INFORMATION WAS INSIDE MY HOUSE AND IT WAS AWESOME
trainval/up4hFjSjcTY/50010 THEY WILL NOT DISAPPOINT
trainval/uPE0G00XFV0/50001 WE GREW UP AND WE GREW OLDER
trainval/uPE0G00XFV0/50002 LIFE WAS PRETTY GOOD
trainval/uPE0G00XFV0/50003 I SPOKE TO HIM ON THE PHONE AT 1030 P
trainval/uPE0G00XFV0/50004 WE TALKED ABOUT THE TV SHOW WE WATCHED THAT EVENING
trainval/uPE0G00XFV0/50005 VERY SADLY HE TOOK HIS OWN LIFE
trainval/uPE0G00XFV0/50006 SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THOSE THREE AS
trainval/uPE0G00XFV0/50007 WE WILL ALL HAVE HIGH HIGHS AND BIG DAYS AND PROUD MOMENTS OF SMILES ON GRADUATION STAGES
trainval/uPE0G00XFV0/50008 I WOULD IMAGINE THAT YOU'D HAVE TO BE PRETTY AWARE OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS AND APPRECIATING THE SMALL WONDERS THAT YOU'RE STARTING TO
trainval/uPE0G00XFV0/50009 AND SO WE'D BUY THE DATE AND WE'D GO HOME
trainval/uPE0G00XFV0/50010 THERE'S JUST SO MANY THINGS TO BE HAPPY ABOUT
trainval/uPE0G00XFV0/50011 I MEAN WE'RE THE ONLY ONES WITH ARCHITECTURE AND AGRICULTURE
trainval/uPE0G00XFV0/50012 WE'VE GOT AIRPLANES HIGHWAY LANES INTERIOR DESIGN AND HOROSCOPE SIGNS
trainval/uPE0G00XFV0/50013 WE'VE GOT FASHION MAGAZINES HOUSE PARTY SCENES
trainval/uPE0G00XFV0/50014 WE'VE GOT BOOKS BUFFETS AND RADIO WAVES WEDDING BRIDES AND ROLLERCOASTER RIDES
trainval/UpkAqPEcMyE/50001 CAN A COMPUTER WRITE POETRY
trainval/UpkAqPEcMyE/50002 BUT IF YOU'RE FEELING A LITTLE BIT UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THIS ANSWER THAT'S OK
trainval/UpkAqPEcMyE/50003 SO YOU'D BE SURPRISED TO FIND THAT POEM 1 WAS WRITTEN BY THE VERY HUMAN POET
trainval/UpkAqPEcMyE/50004 IT'S JUST RAW MATERIAL
trainval/UpkAqPEcMyE/50005 SO WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IS MORE OR LESS A REVERSE TURING TEST
trainval/UpkAqPEcMyE/50006 SO THAT WHEN WE ASK CAN A COMPUTER WRITE POETRY
trainval/UpkAqPEcMyE/50007 WE'RE ALSO ASKING WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE HUMAN AND HOW DO WE PUT BOUNDARIES AROUND THIS CATEGORY
trainval/UpkAqPEcMyE/50008 WE SHOW IT WILLIAM BLAKE THAT'S WHAT IT REFLECTS BACK TO US
trainval/UpkAqPEcMyE/50009 WE SHOW IT GERTRUDE STEIN WHAT WE GET BACK IS GERTRUDE STEIN
trainval/UpkAqPEcMyE/50010 CAN WE BUILD A CREATIVE COMPUTER
trainval/UpkAqPEcMyE/50011 I ALSO BELIEVE THAT ALAN TURING UNDERSTOOD THIS AND THAT WHEN HE DEVISED HIS TEST BACK IN
trainval/UpkAqPEcMyE/50012 SO THAT WHEN WE BEGIN TO GRAPPLE WITH THE IDEAS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE FUTURE WE
trainval/UpkAqPEcMyE/50013 BUT WE SHOULD ALSO BE ASKING OURSELVES WHAT IDEA OF THE HUMAN DO WE WANT TO HAVE REFLECTED BACK TO US
trainval/upNONoxskiw/50001 THE IMAGE I LIKE BEST IS A FLASHLIGHT WE CAN USE THE MIND LIKE A FLASHLIGHT
trainval/upNONoxskiw/50002 IT'S HUMAN OF COURSE TO HAVE THESE KINDS OF EMOTIONS BUT WHAT WE DON'T HAVE TO
trainval/upNONoxskiw/50003 A LOT OF BUZZING OF THE MIND
trainval/upNONoxskiw/50004 IT'S LIKE BEING ON THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN AND JUST BOBBING ALL THE TIME AND NOT EVER
trainval/upNONoxskiw/50005 SO WHAT KIND OF PROBLEMS
trainval/UPRxyy2UB3c/50001 AND SO SHE HAD NEVER MET THEM BEFORE NEVER TALKED TO THEM BEFORE NEVER GOTTEN THE CHANCE TO KNOW THEIR
trainval/UPRxyy2UB3c/50002 SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT MY BROTHER
trainval/uPtP6SnAjJ0/50001 IN OPEN SCIENCE EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD HAS THE RIGHT TO ACCESS THE LATEST RESEARCH
trainval/uPtP6SnAjJ0/50002 AS A NEUROSCIENTIST I SAW THESE PROBLEMS FIRST HAND
trainval/uPtP6SnAjJ0/50003 TOGETHER WITH MY HUSBAND HENRY WHO'S ALSO A NEUROSCIENTIST WE DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS
trainval/uPtP6SnAjJ0/50004 SO NINE YEARS AGO WE STARTED FRONTIERS WHICH IS AN OPEN SCIENCE PLATFORM AND TODAY ONE OF THE
trainval/uPtP6SnAjJ0/50005 BECAUSE WE COMMIT OURSELVES TO PUBLISH ALL THE VALID SCIENCE OUT THERE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE THAT WE ACTUALLY
trainval/uPtP6SnAjJ0/50006 DOES THIS MODEL WORK
trainval/uPtP6SnAjJ0/50007 IN THIS CONTEXT HAVING EFFICIENT AND OPEN ACCESS TO THE LATEST SCIENCE IS IMPORTANT
trainval/uPtP6SnAjJ0/50008 WE HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENTING THOSE SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW
trainval/Uq1idqpX9SA/50001 SO I COMMITTED TO THE IDEA THAT MY CHARACTER WASN'T GOING TO BE AS SCARY AS SOME OF THE OTHERS
trainval/Uq1idqpX9SA/50002 I'D BE HILARIOUS FROM THE MOMENT I WALKED INTO THE ARENA
trainval/Uq1idqpX9SA/50003 WITH EVERY WRESTLING MATCH I DUG DEEPER
trainval/Uq1idqpX9SA/50004 AND TURNING MYSELF UP MADE ME UNFORGETTABLE TO THE FANS
trainval/Uq1idqpX9SA/50005 HE'S A COOL COWBOY WITH A GREAT LAST NAME
trainval/Uq1idqpX9SA/50006 SO I GOT TO THE ARENA EARLY IN THE MORNING THE DAY OF THE SHOW WAITING OUT IN THE PARKING LOT TO SEE IF I COULD SPOT SOME WRESTLERS
trainval/Uq1idqpX9SA/50007 MAN THEY WOULD JUST PUNCH AND KICK ME HARD
trainval/Uq1idqpX9SA/50008 IF YOU'VE EVER LOST SOMEONE YOU KNOW WHAT A DIFFICULT TIME THAT CAN BE
trainval/Uq1idqpX9SA/50009 HE WAS GONE
trainval/Uq1idqpX9SA/50010 ONE OF THE WRESTLERS WHO'D BEEN ON THE SCENE A LONG TIME KNEW WHAT I WAS GOING THROUGH AND HE CAME OVER TO SEE HOW I WAS HOLDING UP
trainval/Uq1idqpX9SA/50011 I FOUND OUT THAT ONCE SOMEONE HAS BEEN TURNED UP IT'S PRETTY HARD TO TURN THEM DOWN
trainval/Uq1idqpX9SA/50012 I LEFT THE RING BUT GATOR STAYED WITH ME AND I USE THE TURNED UP VERSION OF MYSELF EVERY DAY
trainval/Uq1idqpX9SA/50013 I'M TRYING TO TEACH MY CHILDREN THAT TURNING YOURSELF UP IS JUST NOT SOME PERFECT IDEA OF HOW TO BE GREAT IT'S A WAY OF
trainval/Uq1idqpX9SA/50014 MY ONE SON HE'S A WHIZ AT ELECTRONICS
trainval/uq83lU6nuS8/50001 HARD IS HARD
trainval/uq83lU6nuS8/50002 WHO CAN TELL ME THAT HIS COMING OUT STORY IS HARDER THAN TELLING YOUR FIVE YEAR OLD YOU'RE GETTING A DIVORCE
trainval/uq83lU6nuS8/50003 WE NEED TO STOP RANKING OUR HARD AGAINST EVERYONE ELSE'S HARD TO MAKE US FEEL BETTER OR WORSE ABOUT OUR CLOSETS AND JUST
trainval/uqc56GMOYWY/50001 THEY LIKE THE GENERICS
trainval/uqc56GMOYWY/50002 AND SO I STARTED TO LOOK AT WHAT THE MARKETING LOOKED LIKE
trainval/uqc56GMOYWY/50003 THEIR MARKETING IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
trainval/uqc56GMOYWY/50004 AND FOR DONOR AGENCIES UNFORTUNATELY THE AUDIENCE TENDS TO BE PEOPLE THAT AREN'T EVEN IN THE COUNTRY
trainval/uqc56GMOYWY/50005 IN THE PAST 10 YEARS FIVE MILLION PEOPLE HAVE DIED DUE TO A WAR IN THE EAST
trainval/uqc56GMOYWY/50006 THERE ARE MANY HEALTH ISSUES AS WELL
trainval/uQGYr9bnktw/50001 THAT WE TRY TO FIND A PIECE OF THE STATUS QUO SOMETHING THAT BOTHERS US SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED SOMETHING THAT IS
trainval/uQGYr9bnktw/50002 AND I WANT TO SHARE A COUPLE STORIES WITH YOU TODAY
trainval/uQGYr9bnktw/50003 AND THEN HE WENT TO NORTH CAROLINA AND DID IT AGAIN
trainval/uQGYr9bnktw/50005 BUT YOU DON'T NEED EVERYONE
trainval/uQGYr9bnktw/50006 YOU GET TO TELL THE STORY ON BLAKE'S BEHALF ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE WHO GOT THE SHOES
trainval/uQGYr9bnktw/50007 THEY COMMIT TO THE TRIBE
trainval/uQGYr9bnktw/50008 THEY HAVE CURIOSITY
trainval/uQGYr9bnktw/50009 CURIOSITY ABOUT PEOPLE IN THE TRIBE CURIOSITY ABOUT OUTSIDERS
trainval/UQniNhS6LOY/50001 AT ONLY 29 YEARS OLD I'M FAR TOO AWARE THAT I ONLY HAVE SO MANY LONG
trainval/UQniNhS6LOY/50002 YOUR MOTHER IS GOING TO DIE
trainval/UQniNhS6LOY/50003 THAT BASICALLY SUMS UP MY LIFE AS IT IS TODAY
trainval/UQniNhS6LOY/50004 IT WAS THE NEXT PORTION OF THAT SENTENCE THAT OFFERED UP THAT ROUNDHOUSE KICK STRAIGHT TO THE GUT
trainval/UQniNhS6LOY/50005 EVERYTHING I THOUGHT I KNEW WAS ALL OF THE SUDDEN FLIPPED UPSIDE DOWN
trainval/UQniNhS6LOY/50006 AND SO RIGHT THERE I HAD TWO CHOICES
trainval/UQniNhS6LOY/50007 IT'S A QUOTE FROM MARK TWAIN
trainval/UQniNhS6LOY/50008 AND BECAUSE OF MY WORK I WON A GEMINI AWARD AND A CANADIAN SCREEN AWARD
trainval/UQniNhS6LOY/50009 WE WENT TO RUSSIA WE WENT TO KAZAKHSTAN
trainval/UQniNhS6LOY/50010 THE AVERAGE LIFE SPAN FOR THOSE WHO LIFE TO ADULTHOOD IS 30 TO 33
trainval/UQniNhS6LOY/50011 BUT WHAT IF IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE LIKE THAT
trainval/UQniNhS6LOY/50012 HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE TO LIVE
trainval/UqyOedEHIrw/50001 SCIENCE BUDGETS ARE BEING SLASHED
trainval/UqyOedEHIrw/50002 AND IT'S NOT JUST AMERICA
trainval/UqyOedEHIrw/50003 BACK IN THE 20TH CENTURY IT WAS DIFFERENT SCIENCE CAPTURED THE PUBLIC
trainval/UqyOedEHIrw/50004 SO LET ME GROUND THAT IN A FEW PRACTICAL EXAMPLES
trainval/UqyOedEHIrw/50005 CREATE UNEXPECTED ALLIANCES
trainval/UqyOedEHIrw/50006 THE STORY OF MOTHER TO BABY TRANSMISSION CONVERTED RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES FROM BEING
trainval/UqyOedEHIrw/50007 21ST CENTURY MOVEMENTS ARE BUILT THROUGH MASS PARTICIPATION THROUGH PEOPLE DISCOVERING A SENSE OF THEIR OWN
trainval/UqyOedEHIrw/50008 SO FOR EXAMPLE I AM WORKING ON A FUTURE MOVEMENT WITH A GOAL OF ENDING AVOIDABLE
trainval/UqyOedEHIrw/50009 BUT THEY ARE EXPENSIVE AND THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF DOCTORS
trainval/UqyOedEHIrw/50010 WHAT'S WRONG IN OUR WORLD
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50001 DOES IT ACTUALLY GUIDE US WELL
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50002 BUT BEFORE I TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT MINDFULNESS TRAINING IS OR THE RESULTS OF THAT STUDY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50003 AND IT DOES SO VERY FAST
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50004 AND OUR HUNCH WAS THAT IF YOU PUT PEOPLE IN A VERY STRESSFUL ENVIRONMENT IF YOU DISTRACT THEM WITH
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50005 AND THAT'S INDEED WHAT WE FOUND
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50006 AND TO DO THIS WE HAD TO BASICALLY COME UP WITH AN EXPERIMENT IN WHICH WE COULD HAVE PEOPLE GENERATE THEIR OWN
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50007 EVEN THOUGH IT'S QUITE PLAIN TO SEE THAT IT WAS UPSIDE DOWN
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50008 SO WE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE HAVE MIND WANDERING
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50009 THEY TELL US THAT ATTENTION IS VERY POWERFUL IN TERMS OF AFFECTING OUR PERCEPTION
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50010 AND THINGS LIKE STRESS AND MIND WANDERING DIMINISH ITS POWER
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50011 BUT THAT'S ALL IN THE CONTEXT OF THESE VERY CONTROLLED LABORATORY SETTINGS
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50012 WHAT ABOUT IN THE REAL WORLD
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50013 WHAT ABOUT IN OUR ACTUAL DAY TO DAY LIFE
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50014 TO KIND OF BRING IT BACK I'D LIKE TO MAKE A PREDICTION ABOUT YOUR ATTENTION FOR THE REMAINDER OF MY TALK
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50015 OR A SURGEON OR FIREFIGHTER MISSING ANY TIME
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50016 AND WE LAND THERE OFTEN WITHOUT OUR AWARENESS MOST TIMES WITHOUT OUR AWARENESS EVEN IF WE WANT TO BE PAYING ATTENTION
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50017 OFTEN IT HAPPENS WITHOUT OUR AWARENESS
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50018 AND UNDER STRESS IT'S EVEN WORSE WE MIND WANDER MORE POWERFULLY AND MORE OFTEN
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50019 AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY THE ANSWER IS YES
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50020 SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE OFFER THEM VERY ACCESSIBLE LOW TIME CONSTRAINTS TO OPTIMIZE THE
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50021 WELL WE WANT TO FOR EXAMPLE GIVE IT TO STUDENTS RIGHT AROUND FINALS SEASON
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50022 OR WE WANT TO GIVE THE TRAINING TO ACCOUNTANTS DURING TAX SEASON
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50023 OR SOLDIERS AND MARINES WHILE THEY'RE DEPLOYING
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50024 AND THOSE ARE ALSO THE MOMENTS IN WHICH WE WANT THEIR ATTENTION TO BE IN PEAK SHAPE SO THEY CAN PERFORM WELL
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50025 SO WHAT WE DO IN OUR RESEARCH IS WE HAVE THEM TAKE A SERIES OF ATTENTION TESTS
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50026 WE TRACK THEIR ATTENTION AT THE BEGINNING OF SOME KIND OF HIGH STRESS INTERVAL AND THEN TWO MONTHS LATER WE TRACK THEM AGAIN
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50027 IS THERE ANY BENEFIT OF OFFERING THEM MINDFULNESS TRAINING
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50028 CAN WE PROTECT AGAINST THE LAPSES IN ATTENTION THAT MIGHT ARISE OVER HIGH STRESS
trainval/UQzvNIIMayo/50029 THEY WERE NOT AS REACTIVE
trainval/ur03GAmIV8A/50001 THEIR SCREAMING BEGINS YOU RAISE THE ROOF
trainval/ur03GAmIV8A/50002 YOUNG PEOPLE WHO FROM US NEED HOPE AND HIGH EXPECTATION
trainval/ur03GAmIV8A/50003 WHAT ARE YOU PASSIONATE ABOUT
trainval/ur03GAmIV8A/50004 WE GIVE THEM POSITIVE CHOICES
trainval/uRdQS2sjF2s/50001 ONE PART IS ABOUT HISTORY
trainval/uRdQS2sjF2s/50002 AND THROUGH THIS PROCESS IN A SIMPLE WAY THE CHINESE LEARNED THE SKILLS OF BUILDING A
trainval/uRdQS2sjF2s/50003 CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THE FUTURE WORLD WILL LOOK LIKE
trainval/uRdQS2sjF2s/50004 I'M SURE THEY CAN DO IT IF THEY WANT TO DO IT
trainval/uRdQS2sjF2s/50005 SO THAT'S A HUGE PROJECT THERE
trainval/uRdQS2sjF2s/50006 THE CHINESE HAVE PROPOSED AS YOU'RE AWARE SEVERAL MAJOR
trainval/Urk3xn7l3AM/50001 IF YOU ASK IT TO DO THINGS IT MIGHT DO THEM
trainval/Urk3xn7l3AM/50002 AND IF WE COULD DO THAT EVERYTHING WOULD CHANGE
trainval/Urk3xn7l3AM/50003 IF YOU MADE ONE WOULD IT BE CONSCIOUS
trainval/Urk3xn7l3AM/50005 IF YOU MADE ONE OF ME IS THAT ME OR SOMEONE ELSE
trainval/Urk3xn7l3AM/50006 FOR EXAMPLE YOUR MIND JUST ALWAYS RUNS AT THE SAME SPEED BUT AN EM CAN ADD MORE OR LESS COMPUTER HARDWARE TO RUN FASTER OR SLOWER
trainval/Urk3xn7l3AM/50007 THE IDEA IS TO PORT THE SOFTWARE FROM THE HUMAN BRAIN
trainval/Urk3xn7l3AM/50008 NOW YOU MIGHT WONDER WHY WOULD EMS LET HUMANS EXIST
trainval/Urk3xn7l3AM/50009 TO DO THIS WE'RE GOING TO NEED THREE TECHNOLOGIES TO BE GOOD ENOUGH AND NONE OF THEM ARE THERE YET
trainval/Urk3xn7l3AM/50010 BUT THEY DON'T KNOW MUCH THEY CAN'T INFLUENCE MUCH AND THEY'RE OBSESSED WITH THE PAST SO WHAT'S THE POINT
trainval/Urk3xn7l3AM/50011 SUBJECTIVELY THEY REMEMBER A LIFE OF LEISURE
trainval/Urk3xn7l3AM/50012 I JUST WON'T REMEMBER WHAT I DID
trainval/Urk3xn7l3AM/50013 I HATE THIS
trainval/urKhVssiygA/50001 IT WAS THEIR ORIGINAL PROJECT
trainval/urKhVssiygA/50002 I NEVER REALLY WANTED TO BE A NON FICTION WRITER
trainval/urKhVssiygA/50003 I HATED NON FICTION GROWING UP
trainval/urKhVssiygA/50004 IT'S CALLED WALKER AIR FORCE BASE
trainval/urKhVssiygA/50005 THEY SEND OUT A TEAM
trainval/urntcMUJR9M/50001 THAT SOUNDS EXHAUSTING
trainval/urntcMUJR9M/50002 AND SECOND HOW DO WE FIX IT
trainval/urntcMUJR9M/50003 MOST TRANSFORMATIONS HAVE FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL GOALS
trainval/urntcMUJR9M/50004 BUT LOSING WEIGHT ALONE WILL NOT GET YOU ACROSS THE FINISH LINE WITH A WINNING TIME
trainval/urntcMUJR9M/50005 TO ENABLE ITS PEOPLE TO TAKE THAT TRANSFORMATION FIRST OF ALL THEY INVESTED IN NEW TOOLS
trainval/urntcMUJR9M/50006 THEY HADN'T WON A NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP SINCE 1975
trainval/urntcMUJR9M/50007 DURING GAMES HE WOULD OFTEN ASK WHAT ARE YOU SEEING THAT I'M MISSING
trainval/urOCGSMlB9g/50001 I HAD A PORT INSTALLED IN MY CHEST
trainval/urOCGSMlB9g/50002 I WENT TO MY FIRST DAY OF CHEMOTHERAPY AND I WAS AN EMOTIONAL WRECK
trainval/urOCGSMlB9g/50003 JOANNE MADE ME FEEL NORMAL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SIX MONTHS
trainval/urOCGSMlB9g/50004 WE TALKED ABOUT HER BOYFRIENDS WE TALKED ABOUT LOOKING FOR APARTMENTS IN NEW YORK CITY AND WE TALKED ABOUT MY
trainval/urOCGSMlB9g/50005 I SPENT FIVE YEARS INTERVIEWING PHOTOGRAPHING AND FILMING NURSES FOR A BOOK AND A
trainval/urOCGSMlB9g/50006 AND THAT PROPELLED BRIDGET TO GO INTO THE PROFESSION OF NURSING
trainval/urOCGSMlB9g/50007 NOW AS A NURSE IN THE BRONX SHE HAS A REALLY DIVERSE GROUP OF PATIENTS THAT SHE CARES FOR FROM ALL
trainval/urOCGSMlB9g/50008 HE TALKED ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE OF BEING A NURSE IN GERMANY AND TAKING CARE OF THE SOLDIERS COMING RIGHT
trainval/urOCGSMlB9g/50009 YOU'VE ALREADY GIVEN ENOUGH BROTHER
trainval/urOCGSMlB9g/50010 BUT THEN MY CHEMO WAS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN AND THAT TERRIFIED ME BECAUSE I KNEW THAT I WAS GOING TO
trainval/urOCGSMlB9g/50011 AND BEFORE WE LEFT SHE WENT INTO THE ROOM OF A DYING PATIENT
trainval/urOCGSMlB9g/50012 I WASN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO PRETEND ANYMORE AS THOUGH EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL
trainval/urOCGSMlB9g/50013 WE LIVE IN A COMPLICATED TIME WHEN IT COMES TO OUR HEALTH CARE
trainval/UROCz70tlMY/50001 AND FOCUSED WITH GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT
trainval/UROCz70tlMY/50002 WE'RE SPENDING 10 BILLION DOLLARS ON THE CENSUS
trainval/UROCz70tlMY/50003 WE'RE ASKING 10 SIMPLE QUESTIONS IT IS SIMPLICITY
trainval/UROCz70tlMY/50005 WE'RE NOT ASKING IMPORTANT QUESTIONS
trainval/UROCz70tlMY/50006 I WAS ALSO A CURIOUS ECONOMICS MAJOR AS AN UNDERGRAD
trainval/UROCz70tlMY/50007 SO AS I SPENT TIME WITH LEADERS IN THE GNH MOVEMENT I GOT TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE DOING
trainval/UrqRudIUPWs/50001 AND TODAY OUR MISSION IS FRESH FOR ALL
trainval/UrqRudIUPWs/50002 ANYONE WHO'S EVER OPENED A FRIDGE TO FIND MOLDY STRAWBERRIES OR A BAG OF SOGGY SPINACH KNOWS HOW FRUSTRATING AND
trainval/URSuWwvpn5c/50001 THE PICTURE THERE IS KHRUSHCHEV
trainval/URSuWwvpn5c/50002 AND WHICH ONE IS A DEMOCRACY
trainval/URSuWwvpn5c/50003 THAT'S BECAUSE THE TWO COUNTRIES HAVE ABOUT THE SAME POPULATION SIZE
trainval/URSuWwvpn5c/50004 THE WHOLE COUNTRY WENT MAD
trainval/URSuWwvpn5c/50005 IT'S VERY RARE AMONG COUNTRIES TO HAVE THIS KIND OF PATTERN
trainval/URSuWwvpn5c/50006 WHAT ABOUT THE POLITICAL SYSTEM
trainval/URSuWwvpn5c/50007 AND THEY ALL TELL YOU YES WE HAVE WON THE LOTTERY
trainval/URSuWwvpn5c/50008 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE A BAD BASKETBALL PLAYER
trainval/URSuWwvpn5c/50009 COMPARING WITH A SUPERSTAR IS THE WRONG BENCHMARK
trainval/URSuWwvpn5c/50010 HOPEFULLY FIVE YEARS FROM NOW I'M GOING TO REPORT TO TEDGLOBAL THAT POLITICAL REFORMS WILL HAPPEN IN CHINA
trainval/URSuWwvpn5c/50011 BUT CHINA IS A SUPERSTAR IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH
trainval/uRxwQsrI560/50001 AND WHEN THE LIGHT BROKE WE COULD SEE IT AS WELL
trainval/uRxwQsrI560/50002 THE GOVERNMENT DIDN'T CHANGE
trainval/uRxwQsrI560/50003 I SAID WHAT WAS IT
trainval/uRxwQsrI560/50004 AND THEN HE SAID SOMETHING THAT REALLY SHOCKED ME
trainval/uRxwQsrI560/50005 THE POINT IS IT GOES INTO A PILE
trainval/uRxwQsrI560/50006 THE JOURNALISM PLATFORMS THAT WE'VE USED FOR CENTURIES ARE DISPOSABLE
trainval/uRxwQsrI560/50007 AND I BELIEVE THAT THE MAIN THING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN FOR THAT REIMAGINING TO BE SUCCESSFUL
trainval/uRxwQsrI560/50008 IT'S UPDATE AFTER ANOTHER UPDATE
trainval/uS3UYncNwz4/50001 SINCE THAT DAY I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT I WAS RAISED WITHOUT KNOWING IT AS A POP CULTURE
trainval/uS3UYncNwz4/50002 YOU SEE I FOUND A WAY TO TURN THIS PASSION OF MINE INTO A CAREER
trainval/uS3UYncNwz4/50003 AND SO WE'LL SEE A GRUMPY CAT MOVIE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS
trainval/uS3UYncNwz4/50004 AND SO I AM TURNING TO MY MOM WHO IS SITTING RIGHT HERE NEXT TO ME OF COURSE SHE DIDN'T
trainval/uS3UYncNwz4/50005 AND I AM GOING TO TELL YOU THIS ONE THING FROM A SLIGHTLY OUTSIDE PERSPECTIVE AS I'VE MENTIONED TO YOU I AM SWISS FRENCH THOUGH I'VE
trainval/uS7VAFBGWqc/50001 WE'RE JUST FRIENDS
trainval/uSD6RlqHwOk/50001 HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU USED THE WORD AWESOME TODAY
trainval/uSD6RlqHwOk/50002 IMAGINE IF YOU WILL HAVING TO SCHLEP EVERYTHING ON YOUR BACK
trainval/uSD6RlqHwOk/50003 YES PHOTOGRAPHY IS AWESOME
trainval/USkXuQHZmWs/50001 AND I WENT BACK WITH HER TO HER APARTMENT
trainval/USkXuQHZmWs/50002 HE PROGRAMMED MY YOUNG MIND
trainval/USkXuQHZmWs/50003 HOW COULD THAT BE POSSIBLE
trainval/USkXuQHZmWs/50004 IT REALLY DOES
trainval/USkXuQHZmWs/50005 I DON'T QUOTE STATISTICS BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE
trainval/uSMqkSqSgN4/50001 THAT MARLOWE AND SHAKESPEARE BOTH ALLOW THEIR JEWS TO MAKE THIS POINT SUGGESTS I THINK A SHARED UNDERSTANDING
trainval/uSMqkSqSgN4/50002 HE WANTS THE POWER TO COMPEL IDENTIFICATION
trainval/USmTQeKRaP4/50001 I KNEW THEY WERE COMING FOR ME BECAUSE I WAS THE ONLY PERSON FOR MILES AROUND
trainval/USmTQeKRaP4/50002 I TRIED TO REPLICATE WHAT WE HAD DONE IN PAIHIA IN OTHER TOWNS BUT
trainval/USmTQeKRaP4/50003 SO I CREATED THE SEVEN DAY MAKEOVER
trainval/USnf5kbsMlg/50001 WE TEND TO THINK THAT SCIENCE IS ALL ABOUT FACTS AND LOGIC AND HUMAN FEELINGS ARE OFTEN
trainval/USnf5kbsMlg/50002 I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT EMOTIONS ARE AS IMPORTANT IN SCIENCE AS THEY ARE IN ANY OTHER PART OF OUR
trainval/USnf5kbsMlg/50004 SPOCK IS HALF HUMAN AND HALF VULCAN AND VULCANS ARE AN ALIEN RACE
trainval/USnf5kbsMlg/50005 TO TRAVEL OUT TO FIND SPOCK
trainval/USnf5kbsMlg/50006 BUT I SAY WE SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID OF USING OUR FEELINGS TO IMPLEMENT AND TO CATALYZE FACT BASED
trainval/USnf5kbsMlg/50007 THEY COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER AND THEY REINFORCE EACH OTHER
trainval/uSTmKo75gJI/50001 THESE ARE THE SORTS OF THINGS IT MAKES SENSE FOR US TO STAY AWAY FROM BECAUSE THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY CONTAMINATE US
trainval/uSTmKo75gJI/50002 IN FACT JUST HAVING A DISEASED APPEARANCE OR ODD SEXUAL ACTS THESE THINGS ARE ALSO THINGS THAT
trainval/uSTmKo75gJI/50003 I THOUGHT HE MIGHT THROW UP ON ME ACTUALLY
trainval/uSTmKo75gJI/50005 SO WHAT WE CAN DO IS ACTUALLY BRING PEOPLE INTO THE LAB AND DISGUST THEM AND COMPARE THEM TO A CONTROL GROUP THAT HASN'T BEEN
trainval/uSTmKo75gJI/50006 WHEN HIS GRANDMOTHER'S AWAY HE HAS SEX WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND ON HIS GRANDMA'S BED
trainval/uSUOduS5MPc/50001 THOSE CHARACTERIZE THE COMPUTATIONAL PROPERTIES OF THIS NETWORK
trainval/uSUOduS5MPc/50002 BIRD IS ONLY FOUR LETTERS RIGHT
trainval/ut5STVLAFDc/50001 WHAT'S RAPE'S BRAND
trainval/ut5STVLAFDc/50002 THREW US OFF A LITTLE BIT
trainval/ut5STVLAFDc/50003 WE ACTUALLY THOUGHT WE'D FOUND THAT GUY FOR OUR SECOND DOCUMENTARY
trainval/ut5STVLAFDc/50004 I'M GOING TO TELL YOU A STORY THAT'S NOT IN THE FILM
trainval/ut5STVLAFDc/50005 WITNESS NN IS IN THE FILM THIS STORY IS NOT
trainval/UtA860ss1eU/50001 YOU ACTUALLY HAD BACTERIAL SPORES IN THERE
trainval/UtA860ss1eU/50002 AND THEY HAVE VERY INTERESTING SHAPES
trainval/UtA860ss1eU/50003 THEY ARE STIFFER THAN MOST PLASTICS AND THAT'S STRANGE
trainval/UtA860ss1eU/50004 IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING
trainval/UtA860ss1eU/50005 SPORES WILL SHOW THE WAY FOR THAT TOO
trainval/UtA860ss1eU/50006 AT THAT POINT I THOUGHT MAYBE I COULD MAKE USE OF LEGOS THE TOYS THAT I USED TO PLAY SO MUCH WHEN I
trainval/UtA860ss1eU/50007 BOTH ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR OUR SOCIETY
trainval/UtA860ss1eU/50008 I MADE USE OF AN IDEA
trainval/UtA860ss1eU/50009 THE AIR PICKS UP MOISTURE FROM THE SURFACE OF WATER CARRIES IT INTO THE SPORES MAKES THEM MOVE AND THEY'RE
trainval/uTbASmxo858/50001 WELL I WAS WRONG
trainval/uTbASmxo858/50002 THE SOUNDSCAPE IS MADE UP OF THREE BASIC SOURCES
trainval/uTbASmxo858/50003 IN A MATTER OF SECONDS A SOUNDSCAPE REVEALS MUCH MORE INFORMATION FROM MANY PERSPECTIVES
trainval/uTbASmxo858/50004 AND THEY DO THAT FOR TWO REASONS
trainval/utmiqwS2XBQ/50001 THESE GIRLS HAD STORIES
trainval/utmiqwS2XBQ/50002 STORIES OF OVERCOMING HUGE ODD STORIES OF BEING 14 15 16 YEARS OLD AND WAKING UP ONE DAY AND SAY YOU KNOW
trainval/utmiqwS2XBQ/50003 MY LIFE IS A MESS BUT I'M GONNA DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT
trainval/utmiqwS2XBQ/50004 THEY'RE LIKE WE ARE GONNA GIVE YOU A SCHOLARSHIP TO ATTEND A LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN THE FALL
trainval/utV1sdjr4PY/50001 HE ACTUALLY DID THE WEASEL IN ICE AGE
trainval/utV1sdjr4PY/50002 SO IF YOU WANT TO FIND THE RIGHT MOTION FOR A CHARACTER DON'T THINK ABOUT IT GO USE YOUR BODY TO FIND IT
trainval/utV1sdjr4PY/50003 AND IN THAT SITUATION WE CAN EASILY IMAGINE ROBOTS IN THE NEAR FUTURE BEING THERE WITH US
trainval/utV1sdjr4PY/50004 IT WAS AFTER A PASSOVER SEDER
trainval/utV1sdjr4PY/50005 WE DIDN'T HAVE TO COMMUNICATE VERBALLY ABOUT THIS IT ALL JUST HAPPENED
trainval/utV1sdjr4PY/50006 YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR SENSE MEMORY TO RECONSTRUCT THE EMOTIONS AND KIND OF THINK WITH YOUR BODY TO FIND
trainval/utV1sdjr4PY/50007 AND THIS CAME AT THE SAME TIME AS I WAS READING ABOUT THIS TREND IN COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY CALLED EMBODIED COGNITION
trainval/utV1sdjr4PY/50008 MAYBE IT CAN MAKE FOR BETTER ROBOTIC TEAMMATES
trainval/utV1sdjr4PY/50009 THE ROBOT IS THE SAME LAMP THAT YOU SAW AND I PUT TWO BRAINS IN IT
trainval/utV1sdjr4PY/50011 LET'S CALL IT THE CALCULATED BRAIN
trainval/utV1sdjr4PY/50012 THE OTHER GOT MORE THE STAGE ACTOR RISK TAKER BRAIN
trainval/utV1sdjr4PY/50013 LET'S CALL IT THE ADVENTUROUS BRAIN
trainval/utV1sdjr4PY/50014 EVERYBODY'S RIFFING OFF EACH OTHER NOBODY IS STOPPING FOR A MOMENT
trainval/utV1sdjr4PY/50015 SO I TRIED TO MAKE A ROBOT THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT IT'S DOING BUT IS STILL DOING IT
trainval/uU6o2SUFSEY/50001 YOU MIGHT GET MORE CALM
trainval/uUL5oS1Yawo/50001 WELL GUESS WHAT
trainval/uUL5oS1Yawo/50002 THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE
trainval/uUL5oS1Yawo/50003 OUR BRAIN CAN'T WAIT ANOTHER YEAR
trainval/UUqr4P7P3gM/50001 AND YET THAT IS WHAT I FOUND MYSELF FACED WITH IN 2012 WHEN MY
trainval/UUqr4P7P3gM/50002 BUT SAM DIDN'T PASS US BY
trainval/UUqr4P7P3gM/50003 COM WHICH HAS OVER 6
trainval/UUqr4P7P3gM/50004 WELL WAIT A MINUTE
trainval/UUqr4P7P3gM/50005 DEATH MAKES US SO UNCOMFORTABLE
trainval/UUqr4P7P3gM/50006 IF YOU HADN'T NAILED HIM TO THE PERCH HE'D BE PUSHING UP DAISIES
trainval/UUqr4P7P3gM/50007 HE IS OFF THE TWIG
trainval/UUqr4P7P3gM/50008 HIS METABOLIC PROCESSES ARE NOW HISTORY
trainval/UUqr4P7P3gM/50009 HE HAS RUN SHUFFLED OFF HIS MORTAL COIL RUN DOWN THE CURTAIN AND JOINED THE BLEEDING CHOIR
trainval/UUqr4P7P3gM/50010 OKAY SO CAN WE TALK TO HIM
trainval/UUqr4P7P3gM/50011 CAN WE CALL HIM
trainval/UUqr4P7P3gM/50012 CAN WE FACETIME HIM
trainval/UUqr4P7P3gM/50013 WHEN WE LOST SAMMY
trainval/UUqr4P7P3gM/50014 OH LET S GO FIND HIM
trainval/UUqr4P7P3gM/50015 POLITICIANS USE EUPHEMISM ALL THE TIME TO TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT THEY DON T WANT TO TALK
trainval/UUqr4P7P3gM/50016 WE MIGHT SAY SOMEONE IS LET GO WHEN WE MEAN FIRED
trainval/UUqr4P7P3gM/50017 WE DO SPEND AN AWFUL LOT OF OUR TIME TRYING TO AVOID IT
trainval/UUqr4P7P3gM/50018 MY PHONE DIED
trainval/UUqr4P7P3gM/50019 AND WHEN YOU HEAR A PHRASE LIKE THAT YOU REALLY BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT IT
trainval/UUqr4P7P3gM/50020 THIS SHOULD BE A VERY USEFUL REFERENCE FOR TEACHING A CHILD ABOUT DEATH RIGHT
trainval/UUqr4P7P3gM/50021 MY PHONE IS OUT OF BATTERY CHARGE
trainval/UUqr4P7P3gM/50022 IT S HARD TO CHOOSE THOSE WORDS JUST AS IT'S HARD TO SAY THAT MY EIGHT YEAR OLD SON
trainval/UUqr4P7P3gM/50023 DEAD IS DEAD
trainval/UUqr4P7P3gM/50024 AND I'M NOT TRYING TO BE HARSH I'M REALLY NOT
trainval/UUqr4P7P3gM/50025 I TRULY BELIEVE THAT USING A DIRECT AND RESPECTFUL WAY OF TALKING
trainval/UUqr4P7P3gM/50026 IT S NOT GIVING POWER TO DEATH TO SPEAK ITS NAME
trainval/UUqr4P7P3gM/50027 IN FACT I BELIEVE THAT SHROUDING AND CLOUDING DEATH IN PRETTY SUGAR COATED
trainval/UuXeY3S2emA/50001 WHY DID YOU DO IT ONCE
trainval/UuXeY3S2emA/50002 THERE'S OVER 1
trainval/UuXeY3S2emA/50003 GOT A GREAT EXAMPLE FOR YOU
trainval/uVAaZVz9pDs/50001 SO THEN THERE'S ALSO MY FAVORITE EXAMPLE OF SUSPENDED ANIMATION
trainval/uVAaZVz9pDs/50002 AND THAT IS THAT WHEN WE LOWER THE OXYGEN CONCENTRATION FURTHER BY 100 TIMES TO 10 PARTS PER
trainval/uVAaZVz9pDs/50003 THE RESEARCHERS HAD TO SUIT UP JUST TO ENTER IT
trainval/uVAaZVz9pDs/50004 IT STOPPED MOVING
trainval/uVAaZVz9pDs/50005 ITS OXYGEN CONSUMPTION RATE FELL BY TENFOLD
trainval/uVAaZVz9pDs/50006 HE TALKED ABOUT THE GLORIES OF FAILURE
trainval/uVAaZVz9pDs/50007 EVEREST AND THEY CAN SIT THERE FOR HOURS AND THERE'S NO PROBLEM
trainval/uVAaZVz9pDs/50008 WELL WE HAD A LOT OF THEM
trainval/uVAaZVz9pDs/50009 IN FACT SO LOW THAT PHYSICIANS WILL NOT HAVE TO LOWER OR DIM THE METABOLISM OF PEOPLE MUCH AT ALL TO SEE THE BENEFIT I
trainval/UvbFr0eSsg8/50001 SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN CLOSED AND THEY WON'T REOPEN
trainval/UvbFr0eSsg8/50002 HE WANTS US OUT OF THE COUNTRY
trainval/UvbFr0eSsg8/50003 I LIVE IN EXILE
trainval/UvbFr0eSsg8/50004 I HAVE NO CONTEXT FOR IT
trainval/UvbFr0eSsg8/50005 MY PARENTS' GAMBLE HAS PAID OFF
trainval/UvbFr0eSsg8/50006 AS A RESULT I'M NOT WIRED TO BE CONTENT WITH THE STATUS QUO
trainval/UvbFr0eSsg8/50007 BUT I SHOW UP ANYWAY
trainval/UvbFr0eSsg8/50008 MORE THAN ONCE I STARE DOWN THE BARREL OF A SEMI AUTOMATIC WEAPON WITH THE SWEATY TRIGGER FINGER
trainval/UvbFr0eSsg8/50009 I'M NOW IN MY FORTIES
trainval/UvbFr0eSsg8/50010 LET YOUR CHILDREN EXPERIENCE SOME OF THE HARDSHIPS OF EVERYDAY LIFE SO THEY CAN GET TO KNOW THEIR MOST
trainval/UVDgemuZdho/50001 WHEN PEOPLE MEET ME AT PARTIES AND THEY FIND OUT THAT I'M AN ENGLISH PROFESSOR WHO SPECIALIZES IN
trainval/UVDgemuZdho/50002 I'M GOING TO DO THIS AS A SHOW OF HANDS
trainval/UVDgemuZdho/50003 AGAIN A SHOW OF HANDS
trainval/UVDgemuZdho/50004 AND THEN THEY STOP TALKING
trainval/UVDgemuZdho/50005 AND I THINK A WORD THAT THEY'RE WATCHING RIGHT NOW IS YOLO
trainval/UVDgemuZdho/50006 AND ONE OF THE WAYS THEY CAN BE TROUBLESOME IS THAT THEY'RE CHANGING MEANING
trainval/UVDgemuZdho/50007 TO SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN WE'LL LOOK AT AN EXAMPLE
trainval/UVDgemuZdho/50008 WE CAN GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE RANGE OF OPINIONS ABOUT CONTESTED USAGE
trainval/UVDgemuZdho/50009 NOW HERE IS WHAT I DO TO FILL OUT THE BALLOT
trainval/UVDgemuZdho/50010 ARE YOU BOTHERED BY LANGUAGE FADS AND LANGUAGE CHANGE
trainval/UVDgemuZdho/50011 WELL YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/UVDgemuZdho/50012 LANGUAGE JUST DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY
trainval/UVDgemuZdho/50013 I HOPE THAT WHAT YOU CAN DO IS FIND LANGUAGE CHANGE NOT WORRISOME
trainval/UVDgemuZdho/50014 OR DO YOU FIND IT FUN
trainval/UVDgemuZdho/50015 THAT WORD MIGHT BE SLANGY THAT WORD MIGHT BE INFORMAL THAT WORD MIGHT BE A WORD THAT YOU THINK IS ILLOGICAL
trainval/UVqoIgh7bcw/50001 I'M A BIG SPORTS FAN AND I GOT TO DO THE HALFTIME SHOWS AT SOME FOOTBALL GAMES AND MY LOCAL ICE HOCKEY GAME
trainval/UVqoIgh7bcw/50002 SHORTLY AFTER THAT MY GRANDFATHER DIED OF PROSTATE CANCER AND WITHIN ABOUT SIX MONTHS
trainval/UVqoIgh7bcw/50004 I DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO BE DOING A LOT OF THE PROMOTIONS THAT I WANTED TO BE DOING
trainval/UVZyVz8gBeQ/50001 THAT'S BAD INTENTIONS
trainval/UVZyVz8gBeQ/50002 RESISTANCE IS FUTILE
trainval/UVZyVz8gBeQ/50003 DON'T OVEREXAGGERATE POTENTIAL SUPERPOWERS THAT DO NOT EXIST
trainval/uW9tg1vJwZQ/50001 I BELIEVE WE CAN TEACH KIDS ABOUT COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY BY HAVING THEM DO WHAT THEY LIKE TO DO BEST
trainval/uW9tg1vJwZQ/50002 LET ME SHOW YOU HOW SIMPLE THIS CAN BE
trainval/uWfLwKHSEko/50001 AND WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS TO BRING THE UNDERGROUND DRUG MARKETS AS MUCH AS
trainval/uWfLwKHSEko/50002 THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE KIDS ONE'S ADDICTED TO ALCOHOL THE OTHER ONE'S ADDICTED TO COCAINE OR HEROIN AND THEY ASK THEMSELVES THE
trainval/UWKvpFZJwcE/50001 IT'S A WAY OF PROCESSING WHAT'S GOING ON SO THAT WE CAN USE IT LATER
trainval/UWKvpFZJwcE/50002 WE NEED TO PRACTICE
trainval/UWKvpFZJwcE/50003 PRACTICE FOR SOME REASON BECAME A VERY NEGATIVE THING
trainval/UWKvpFZJwcE/50004 IT'S VERY POSITIVE
trainval/UWKvpFZJwcE/50005 NOW WORKING MEMORY HAS FOUR BASIC COMPONENTS
trainval/UWKvpFZJwcE/50006 IT ALLOWS US TO STORE SOME IMMEDIATE EXPERIENCES AND A LITTLE BIT OF KNOWLEDGE
trainval/UWKvpFZJwcE/50007 JUST HANG ON TO THEM
trainval/UWKvpFZJwcE/50008 WHILE YOU'RE HANGING ON TO THEM I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO ANSWER THREE QUESTIONS
trainval/UWKvpFZJwcE/50009 I WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THOSE WORDS
trainval/UWKvpFZJwcE/50010 HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE ARE STILL PRETTY SURE YOU'VE GOT ALL FIVE WORDS
trainval/UWKvpFZJwcE/50011 SOME PEOPLE CAN HANG ON TO FIVE
trainval/UWKvpFZJwcE/50012 SOME PEOPLE CAN HANG ON TO 10
trainval/UWKvpFZJwcE/50013 SOME WILL BE DOWN TO TWO OR THREE
trainval/UWKvpFZJwcE/50014 NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG WORKING MEMORY IS AWESOME
trainval/UWKvpFZJwcE/50015 WE CAN BE IN THE MIDDLE OF A MEETING LISTEN TO SOMEBODY'S PRESENTATION EVALUATE IT DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT WE LIKE IT
trainval/UWKvpFZJwcE/50016 DO I AGREE WITH THE ASSUMPTIONS
trainval/UWKvpFZJwcE/50017 WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS SPIN THAT AROUND
trainval/UWKvpFZJwcE/50018 ORGANIZATION HELPS SO WE NEED TO STRUCTURE WHAT WE'RE DOING IN WAYS THAT MAKE SENSE
trainval/UWKvpFZJwcE/50019 WE ALL STARTED AS NOVICES
trainval/UWKvpFZJwcE/50020 EVERYTHING WE DO IS AN APPROXIMATION OF SOPHISTICATION
trainval/UWKvpFZJwcE/50021 WE WANT TO TAKE ALL OF OUR EXISTENCE AND WRAP IT AROUND THAT NEW KNOWLEDGE AND MAKE ALL OF THESE CONNECTIONS AND IT BECOMES MORE MEANINGFUL
trainval/UWKvpFZJwcE/50022 THE SUPPORT MAY COME IN ASKING PEOPLE QUESTIONS GIVING THEM A SHEET OF PAPER THAT HAS AN ORGANIZATIONAL CHART ON
trainval/UWKvpFZJwcE/50023 WE ARE BUILT FOR IMAGES
trainval/UWKvpFZJwcE/50024 WE NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT
trainval/UWKvpFZJwcE/50025 THINK ABOUT THINGS IN IMAGES WRITE THINGS DOWN THAT WAY
trainval/Uwl012o8P7I/50001 I DON'T KNOW IF WE NAMED THE APPLE OR IF THE APPLE NAMED US BUT
trainval/Uwl012o8P7I/50002 AND THERE ARE A COUPLE OF ANSWERS TO THAT QUESTION
trainval/Uwl012o8P7I/50003 HE WAS THE MOST RESPECTED SCIENTIST IN THE FIELD
trainval/Uwl012o8P7I/50004 THE SVALBARD GLOBAL SEED VAULT IS A WONDERFUL GIFT THAT NORWAY AND OTHERS HAVE GIVEN US BUT IT'S NOT THE COMPLETE
trainval/UwtYQFSJSQc/50001 I HOPE I CAN GIVE YOU ANSWERS BY THE END OF THIS 15 MINUTE PRESENTATION BUT
trainval/UwtYQFSJSQc/50002 SO I DON'T THINK THIS WILL BE THE FUTURE FOR CHINA
trainval/UwtYQFSJSQc/50003 HAROLD BROWN THE FORMER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
trainval/UwtYQFSJSQc/50004 THEY ALL AGREED TO ONE FACT THAT IS BY 2025 CHINA IS NOT GOING TO BE A
trainval/UwtYQFSJSQc/50005 GLOBALLY THE US WILL STILL BE THE HEGEMON
trainval/UwtYQFSJSQc/50006 DON'T FORGET THAT AMERICA'S RISE WAS BASED IN SIGNIFICANT PART ON THE
trainval/UwtYQFSJSQc/50007 BUT AFTER 2010 THE YEAR WHEN WE ALL THINK CHINA BEGAN TO MAKE SOME
trainval/UwtYQFSJSQc/50008 HOWEVER GIVEN THE FACT THAT AMERICA IS A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM PUBLIC OPINIONS DO MATTER
trainval/UwtYQFSJSQc/50009 I HAVEN'T TALKED MUCH ABOUT THE US
trainval/UwtYQFSJSQc/50010 BUT I THINK IN ORDER TO TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF CHINA WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE US
trainval/ux1GxExRUUY/50001 IT WAS A GRAY NOVEMBER DAY AND I WAS OVERDUE
trainval/ux1GxExRUUY/50002 WE WON'T GROW ANYMORE
trainval/ux1GxExRUUY/50004 AND COMPANIES WILL LOOK FOR TALENTS SOMEWHERE ELSE
trainval/ux1GxExRUUY/50005 THE HOSPITAL'S MATERNITY WARD WAS REALLY STRESSED OUT BECAUSE A LOT OF BABIES WERE
trainval/ux1GxExRUUY/50006 WE DE AVERAGED THEM AND BROKE THEM DOWN INTO DIFFERENT SKILL LEVELS AND WHAT WE FOUND
trainval/ux1GxExRUUY/50007 AS A MATTER OF FACT 1964 WAS THE YEAR WITH THE HIGHEST BIRTH RATE EVER IN
trainval/ux1GxExRUUY/50008 NOW THE SHORT ANSWER WOULD BE THAT OUR NUMBERS ALREADY INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN
trainval/ux1GxExRUUY/50009 SEND ME MORE OF THESE MACHINES
trainval/ux1GxExRUUY/50010 LAST YEAR WE JUST HIT OVER 600000 SO HALF OF MY NUMBER
trainval/ux1GxExRUUY/50011 SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
trainval/ux1GxExRUUY/50012 IF THEY ARE THE SCARCE RESOURCE WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THEM MUCH BETTER
trainval/UxLRv0FEndM/50001 IT'S MUCH MORE LIKE AN ANIMAL CALL THAN IT IS LIKE SPEECH
trainval/UxLRv0FEndM/50002 SO HERE WE'VE GOT SOME LAUGHTER FOR YOU
trainval/UxLRv0FEndM/50003 THIS IS WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL
trainval/UxLRv0FEndM/50005 SO IF YOU ASK HUMAN BEINGS WHEN DO YOU LAUGH
trainval/UxLRv0FEndM/50007 SO I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS IN MORE DETAIL
trainval/UxLRv0FEndM/50008 WE TOOK IT INTO THE SCANNER TO SEE HOW BRAINS RESPOND WHEN YOU HEAR LAUGHTER
trainval/UxLRv0FEndM/50009 NOW I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE LIMITED TO ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS
trainval/UxLRv0FEndM/50011 WHEN YOU START LAUGHING HARD YOU START SQUEEZING AIR OUT FROM YOUR LUNGS UNDER MUCH HIGHER PRESSURES THAN YOU COULD
trainval/UxLRv0FEndM/50012 THAT WOULD BE STRESSFUL
trainval/UxLRv0FEndM/50013 IT WAS A VERY BASIC REACTION TO FIND SOME REASON WE CAN DO THIS
trainval/UxLRv0FEndM/50014 WE CAN LAUGH TOGETHER
trainval/UxLRv0FEndM/50015 WE'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS
trainval/UxLRv0FEndM/50016 WE'RE GOING TO BE OKAY
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50001 AND I WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50002 WHEN I ASKED MY FRIEND WHY THE RED BRIGADES WANT TO TALK TO ME HE SAID THAT THE FEMALE MEMBERS
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50003 NOW I FOUND THE ANSWER VERY QUICKLY
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50004 SHE ALSO EMBRACED VIOLENCE
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50005 BECAUSE THEY HAD NO IDEA
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50006 ALL THE OTHERS DO DAY IN AND DAY OUT IS SEARCH FOR MONEY
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50007 ONCE FOR EXAMPLE I WAS INTERVIEWING THIS PART TIMER FROM THE RED BRIGADES
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50008 IT WAS A PSYCHIATRIST
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50009 HE WAS A REALLY KEEN SAILOR
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50010 AND HE TOLD ME THAT THE BEST TIME OF HIS LIFE WAS WHEN HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE RED BRIGADES AND HE WENT SAILING EVERY
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50012 YOU KNOW THAT WOMAN THAT GOES AROUND TO FOUNDATIONS ASKING FOR MONEY THINKING ABOUT THE ECONOMICS OF TERRORISM
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50013 AND THERE ARE THREE MAIN STAGES
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50014 SO STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM FEATURE OF THE COLD WAR
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50015 THIS IS WHEN THE TWO SUPERPOWERS WERE FIGHTING A WAR BY PROXY ALONG THE PERIPHERY OF THE SPHERE
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50016 AND THEY DREW A LIST OF PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY WOULD TALK AND TELL THEIR STORY
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50017 AND ABOVE ALL IT'S NOT GOING TO BE BORING
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50018 BUT ALSO THAT IS ABLE TO CARRY OUT ATTACKS IN MORE THAN ONE COUNTRY
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50019 NOW DEREGULATION ALSO BROUGHT BACK ROGUE ECONOMICS
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50020 SO WHAT IS ROGUE ECONOMICS
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50021 IT COMES BACK AT TIMES OF GREAT TRANSFORMATION GLOBALIZATION BEING ONE OF THOSE TRANSFORMATIONS
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50023 ECONOMY BECAUSE THE BULK OF THE MONEY WAS DENOMINATED IN U
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50024 WHAT DOES IT MEAN
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50025 THAT MEANS THAT IT HAS A PRIVILEGE THAT OTHER COUNTRIES DO NOT HAVE
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50026 AND THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE DID
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50027 NOBODY WANTS THE U
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50028 WHY DID THIS HAPPEN
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50029 THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE THE PATRIOT ACT WAS A UNILATERAL LEGISLATION
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50030 IT WAS INTRODUCED ONLY IN THE UNITED STATES
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50031 AND IT WAS INTRODUCED ONLY FOR THE U
trainval/uXlSmKZ7aSc/50032 IT'S GOING TO BE FRIGHTFUL BUT IT'S GOING TO ENLIGHTEN YOU
trainval/uxnjyfSeRpI/50001 TAKE FOR EXAMPLE HOW LOOKING AT SIMPLY SOMEONE'S RACE WOULD GIVE YOU AN UNTRUE VIEW OF WHO THEY ARE
trainval/uxnjyfSeRpI/50002 AND WOULD MAKE MORE PROGRESS
trainval/UxtJtlgDkC8/50001 THIS IS WHAT WE'RE SEEING
trainval/UxtJtlgDkC8/50002 SO WHAT IS THE MORAL OF THIS STORY
trainval/UxXOi6Zwm7Q/50001 IT'S CALLED LOVE INC
trainval/UxXOi6Zwm7Q/50002 OUR VIDEO WAS EVERYWHERE
trainval/UxXOi6Zwm7Q/50003 OUR MUSIC WAS EVERYWHERE
trainval/UxXOi6Zwm7Q/50004 I WAS ON TOUR ACROSS CANADA BRANCHING INTO THE US AND EUROPE
trainval/UxXOi6Zwm7Q/50005 I HAD TO WALK AWAY AND MAINTAIN MY INTEGRITY WALKING AWAY FROM BIG DEALS A LOT OF
trainval/UxYtVyTowQs/50001 THIS IS DUE TO THE LACK OF CEREBRAL LATERALIZATION IN THE BRAIN WHICH IS FOR ANOTHER WORDS LANGUAGE
trainval/UxYtVyTowQs/50002 SO PRETTY MUCH ALL OF US
trainval/UY2tyuSOcyo/50001 I HAD A CLIENT CHARGED WITH A SERIOUS ASSAULT
trainval/UY2tyuSOcyo/50002 YOU WALK OUTSIDE BUT SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT
trainval/UY2tyuSOcyo/50003 THEN I LOOKED AT THE PICTURES
trainval/uYaF8pSTNSU/50001 I WAS THE ONLY ONE OUT OF THE FINAL FOUR CANDIDATES THAT NEVER GOT A FRONT PAGE INTERVIEW
trainval/uYaF8pSTNSU/50002 SO AT 238PM ON MONDAY WOMEN IN ICELAND LEFT WORK BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THEY HAD EARNED THEIR
trainval/UyQIKwSPZGM/50001 TOLERANCE IS WHERE WE ARE AND TOLERANCE IS THE BAR OUR SOCIETY ASSESSED ITS HIGHEST SCORE
trainval/UyQIKwSPZGM/50002 IMAGINE THE CURRICULUM IN AMERICA BASED ON THE ACCEPTANCE OF ALL CULTURES IN OUR NATION AND IN THE WORLD
trainval/UyQIKwSPZGM/50003 WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT US
trainval/UyQIKwSPZGM/50004 IN FACT I SEE THE ROOT OF THIS TYPE OF CELEBRATION THROUGHOUT HISTORY AND AROUND THE WORLD EVERYDAY
trainval/UyQIKwSPZGM/50005 NAZI LEADERS TOLD THE KING TO MARK ALL JEWS WITH THE STAR OF DAVID
trainval/UyUXxrSS3qs/50001 NOW MOST ENCOUNTERS WITH MALE OFFENDERS ARE PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD
trainval/UyUXxrSS3qs/50002 WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO BECOME INVOLVED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM DUE TO POOR COPING STRATEGIES DEALING
trainval/UyUXxrSS3qs/50003 BUT WHEN WOMEN FIGHT IT'S ALMOST ALWAYS ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS AND PARTNERS AND JEALOUSY
trainval/UyUXxrSS3qs/50004 SO IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY LANDLORDS WHO MAKE A BUSINESS OF PROVIDING RELEASE HOUSING OPTIONS
trainval/UyUXxrSS3qs/50005 DO WE CUT MALES MORE SLACK BECAUSE BOYS WILL BE BOYS AND WE KIND OF EXPECT THEM TO GET INTO A LITTLE
trainval/uYyvbgINZkQ/50001 HOW MUCH BETTER WOULD OUR LIVES BE
trainval/uYyvbgINZkQ/50002 HOW MUCH BETTER WOULD OUR COUNTRY BE
trainval/uYyvbgINZkQ/50003 SO GO LOOKING FOR YOUR BIAS
trainval/uYyvbgINZkQ/50004 I DID THE BLACK GUY THING
trainval/uYyvbgINZkQ/50006 I'LL TAKE YOU THERE
trainval/uYyvbgINZkQ/50007 LIKE I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO WORK FOR ME
trainval/UzuUljhS9uI/50001 I CAN'T WAIT TO TELL YOU ABOUT MY PLANS FOR THE WEEKEND
trainval/UzuUljhS9uI/50002 AND WHEN I SAY GROWING UP
trainval/UzuUljhS9uI/50003 I THINK YOU'VE GOT SOME SAY
trainval/UzuUljhS9uI/50004 THIS IS WHAT WE WANT FOR TEENAGERS
trainval/UzuUljhS9uI/50005 HE WAS REALLY AT RISK OF NOT MAKING IT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL
trainval/UzuUljhS9uI/50006 AND WHEN A SPOT OPENED UP IN THE KITCHEN HE OFFERED IT TO THE GUY
trainval/V1gxziZwmkc/50001 HE ASKED ME IF I WAS A MODEL
trainval/V1gxziZwmkc/50002 THE PROFESSION SUITED ME REALLY WELL
trainval/V1gxziZwmkc/50003 WHEREVER I WOULD GO THEY WOULD WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WANNA SEND ME SOMEPLACE ELSE
trainval/V1gxziZwmkc/50004 THEY HAVE THIS FABULOUS TRADITION IN JAPAN
trainval/V1gxziZwmkc/50005 IT WAS CARVED OUT OF ONE SOLID PIECE OF WOOD
trainval/V1gxziZwmkc/50006 I TURNED BACK TO THE GRANDMOTHER I'M SORRY WABI SABI IS THAT LIKE A DESK
trainval/V1gxziZwmkc/50007 THE GRANDMOTHER SAID THAT BEAUTY IS A STUDY IN CONTRASTS SO SOMETHING CAN ONLY BE SEEN TO
trainval/V1gxziZwmkc/50008 WITHIN A FEW MOMENTS I HEARD SHOUTING
trainval/V1gxziZwmkc/50009 I LOOKED UP AND SAW DISHEVELED LOOKING WOMAN WHO APPEARED TO BE SHOUTING AT ME
trainval/V1gxziZwmkc/50010 I AM NOT I AM NOT THE PRESIDENT I AM A TEENAGER
trainval/V1gxziZwmkc/50011 FROM THE OTHER ROOM MYOKO CHIMED IN AGAIN
trainval/V1gxziZwmkc/50012 EVERY EYE IN THE PLACE WAS UPON US
trainval/V1gxziZwmkc/50013 THE WOMAN WITH THE PHOTOS ABOVE HER HEAD AND ME THE ONLY WESTERNER
trainval/V1gxziZwmkc/50014 KILL HER PARENTS THIS WOMAN IS CRAZY THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT
trainval/V1gxziZwmkc/50015 I SLAMMED MY BOOK TOGETHER STARTED THROWING MY STUFF IN MY BAG
trainval/V1gxziZwmkc/50016 SHE STOPPED CRYING SHE STOPPED SCREAMING SHE BECAME SILENT
trainval/V1gxziZwmkc/50017 EVERYONE YOUNG AND OLD ALIKE BOWED BACK
trainval/V1ItvwxBENg/50001 THESE TWO COUNTRIES COMPLETELY DIFFERENT POLITICAL MODELS AND COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ECONOMIC MODELS AND YET THEY HAVE THE SAME INCOME
trainval/V1ItvwxBENg/50002 AND SO THEY HAVE TO COME TO THE TABLE AS WELL
trainval/V1K3GvSKyJQ/50001 HAS ANYONE HERE SEEN THOSE
trainval/V1K3GvSKyJQ/50002 SO THEY HAD SEEN A LOT OF UPS AND DOWNS AND IT'S TOUGH ENOUGH TO BE A FARMER
trainval/V1K3GvSKyJQ/50003 256 FAMILIES SIGNED OUR POOLING EASEMENT AGREEMENT
trainval/V1K3GvSKyJQ/50004 WE TRIED TO USE BEST PRACTICES AND BELIEVE ME THE PEOPLE THERE WHEN WE SET OUT
trainval/V1K3GvSKyJQ/50005 IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE STATE OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT COMES TO THE RESCUE
trainval/V1K3GvSKyJQ/50006 WHY IS THAT
trainval/V1K3GvSKyJQ/50007 AND I BELIEVE THAT WIND POWER IS ONE WAY TO DO THAT
trainval/V1K3GvSKyJQ/50008 AND RATHER THAN SPEND A LOT MORE TIME TALKING ABOUT IT I'M GOING TO QUEUE UP A LITTLE VIDEO
trainval/V1K3GvSKyJQ/50009 BEN CAME UP AFTER WE GOT THINGS GOING
trainval/V1K3GvSKyJQ/50010 IT'S ALL I CAN DO TO UNZIP ONE
trainval/V1qHNrQQHZI/50001 THE LAST TIME THERE WAS A REVOLUTION IN IT OF SIMILAR MAGNITUDE WAS
trainval/V1qHNrQQHZI/50002 THESE ARE LINEAR PROCESSES AND A ROLL OF PAPYRUS WAS GREAT FOR CAPTURING THAT
trainval/V1qHNrQQHZI/50003 FOR THE FIRST THOUSAND YEARS READING WAS SOMETHING YOU DID OUT LOUD
trainval/V1qHNrQQHZI/50004 ALL PAPYRUS CAME FROM EGYPT
trainval/V1qHNrQQHZI/50005 SIX HUNDRED MORE YEARS BEFORE THEY FULLY EXPLOITED THE NEW TECHNOLOGY
trainval/V1qHNrQQHZI/50006 WHEN IS IT GOING TO BE AWESOME LIKE IT OUGHT TO BE
trainval/V1xt7zgnuK0/50001 WE HIKED WE SWAM WE PRACTICED MARTIAL ARTS TOGETHER WE COULD DISCUSS ANYTHING FROM BLACK HOLES
trainval/V1xt7zgnuK0/50002 I'D LEARNED TO LET GO OF THE SAFETY OF CONFORMITY AND I WAS READY TO MEET OTHER
trainval/V1xt7zgnuK0/50003 AND GUESS HOW MANY I MET
trainval/V1xt7zgnuK0/50004 I WASN'T THAT WEIRD OF A KID
trainval/V1xt7zgnuK0/50005 BUT IF THAT PERSON IS TOTALLY INTO THE 36TH CHAMBER OF SHAOLIN
trainval/v22SdEMzxO4/50001 AND IT'S NOT JUST CATERERS IT'S HOTELIERS IT'S RETAILERS IT'S ANYONE WHO PROVIDES SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC OR BUSINESSES
trainval/v22SdEMzxO4/50002 THERE'S ALL SORTS OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAN USE THESE POOLS OF VERY FLEXIBLE PEOPLE POSSIBLY ALREADY
trainval/v22SdEMzxO4/50003 THEIR AVAILABILITY FOR WORK CAN BE SUCH THAT IT'S A FEW HOURS TODAY
trainval/v22SdEMzxO4/50004 WELL SHE MIGHT BE WILLING TO WORK ODD HOURS IN A CALL CENTER IN A RECEPTION AREA IN A MAIL ROOM
trainval/v22SdEMzxO4/50005 MAYBE I CAN WORK TOMORROW BUT I DON'T KNOW IF AND WHEN YET
trainval/v22SdEMzxO4/50006 SHE CAN GO TO AIRBNB TO LIST HER SOFA BED SHE CAN GO TO TASKRABBIT
trainval/v22SdEMzxO4/50007 IT MANAGES COUNTERPARTY RISK IN INCREDIBLY SOPHISTICATED WAYS
trainval/v22SdEMzxO4/50008 IT'S ALL EXTREMELY LOW OVERHEAD
trainval/v22SdEMzxO4/50009 AND IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT FOR THESE PEOPLE TO FIND THE WORK THAT THEY SO OFTEN NEED VERY BADLY
trainval/v22SdEMzxO4/50010 A MODERN MARKET IS MORE THAN A WEBSITE IT'S A WEB OF INTEROPERABLE MARKETPLACES BACK
trainval/v22SdEMzxO4/50011 WHICH IS A TRAGEDY BECAUSE THERE ARE EMPLOYERS WHO CAN USE POOLS OF VERY FLEXIBLE LOCAL PEOPLE
trainval/v22SdEMzxO4/50012 THERE IS A PRECEDENT FOR TECHNOLOGY ENABLED SERVICE THAT HAS BEEN INITIATED BY POLITICIANS IN
trainval/v22SdEMzxO4/50013 AND IMAGINE THAT THE CONSORTIA WHO BID TO RUN IT ARE TOLD WHOEVER COMES IN AT THE LOWEST PERCENTAGE
trainval/v22SdEMzxO4/50014 SO GOVERNMENT THEN EXITS THE FRAME
trainval/v22SdEMzxO4/50015 SO IF THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH A SHORTAGE OF BABYSITTERS IN SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND THE PROBLEM IS NOBODY CAN AFFORD THE VETTING AND
trainval/v22SdEMzxO4/50016 SO IT'S SMALL TRADES BY SMALL PEOPLE BUT IT'S VERY INFORMED SAFE
trainval/v22SdEMzxO4/50017 SOME ROUGH RESEARCH SUGGESTS THIS COULD UNLOCK AROUND 100 MILLION POUNDS' WORTH A DAY OF NEW ECONOMIC
trainval/V2DgJBx3cyA/50001 SO ANTIBODIES ARE THE PROTEINS THAT OUR WHITE BLOOD CELLS NORMALLY MAKE IN RESPONSE TO INFECTIONS AND OTHER
trainval/V2DgJBx3cyA/50002 NOW THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY HAS ALREADY BEEN QUITE SUCCESSFUL IN MAKING SYNTHETIC ANTIBODIES
trainval/V2DgJBx3cyA/50003 SO HOW WOULD WE DO THAT IN PLANTS
trainval/V2DgJBx3cyA/50004 HOW WOULD WE DO SOMETHING SIMILAR IN PLANTS
trainval/V2DgJBx3cyA/50005 HOW DO WE START TO MAKE MEDICINES AVAILABLE FOR THE POOR IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WHO
trainval/V2DgJBx3cyA/50006 SO WE JUST EXTEND THIS IDEA AND WE ARE LOOKING AT THE IDEA OF USING HIV ANTIBODIES IN LATE
trainval/V2DgJBx3cyA/50007 SO THE STANDARD OF CARE IN THESE PLACES IS TO WAIT FOR SOMEBODY TO GET BITTEN BY A POTENTIALLY RABID ANIMAL
trainval/V2DgJBx3cyA/50008 AGAIN THERE IS A PROBLEM
trainval/V2DgJBx3cyA/50009 THERE WAS NO VACCINE NO TREATMENTS AVAILABLE FOR EBOLA
trainval/V2DgJBx3cyA/50010 AND SO FOR THAT REASON THE US GOVERNMENT HAS PUT A LOT OF MONEY INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PRODUCT
trainval/V2DgJBx3cyA/50011 OF COURSE WE DO HAVE ANTIRETROVIRAL DRUGS WHICH ARE CURRENTLY USED FOR THIS PURPOSE AND ARE ACTUALLY VERY EFFECTIVE
trainval/v2jSfxnRPSE/50001 BUT THE WHALES WILL STILL BE IN CONCRETE TANKS
trainval/v2jSfxnRPSE/50002 THE BEST SOLUTION IS TO BUILD NATURAL SEASIDE SANCTUARIES WHERE CAPTIVE WHALES AND DOLPHINS CAN
trainval/v2jSfxnRPSE/50003 KEIKO ALWAYS LOVED TO CHASE BIRDS ACROSS HIS BAY
trainval/V2PP3p4S4R8/50001 IF IT DOESN'T TELL ME SOMETHING GOOD RIGHT NOW I KNOW IF I KEEP THIS UP I'M GOING TO GET WHERE I'M GOING
trainval/V2PP3p4S4R8/50002 IF YOU'RE FOCUSED ON YOUR GOAL YOU'LL NEVER ACHIEVE IT
trainval/V2PP3p4S4R8/50003 SO HOW DOES THIS WORK
trainval/V2PP3p4S4R8/50004 THE WAY THAT I DO IT IN MY LIFE
trainval/V2PP3p4S4R8/50005 THINK ABOUT OUR KIDS
trainval/V2PP3p4S4R8/50006 WE HAVE GOALS FOR OUR KIDS
trainval/V2u6CzpRqts/50001 I WANTED TO SHARE THEM
trainval/V2u6CzpRqts/50002 SO I ASKED EACH TO WRITE THE TESTIMONY WHICH WOULD ACCOMPANY THE PHOTOGRAPH
trainval/V2u6CzpRqts/50003 THE IMPACT IS NOT JUST ONLINE
trainval/V3CLRL32Mcw/50001 SO WE ARE MORE PRONE TO IMPULSE BUYS
trainval/V3CLRL32Mcw/50002 AND IT WASN'T A CLOSET LIKE I WAS USED TO BACK IN CALIFORNIA
trainval/V3CLRL32Mcw/50003 AND IT TURNS OUT THEY DID
trainval/V3CLRL32Mcw/50005 I FELT SO BAD FOR THESE FRENCH PEOPLE
trainval/V3CLRL32Mcw/50006 HOW DID THEY COPE WITH SUCH LITTLE STORAGE SPACE
trainval/V3CLRL32Mcw/50007 I DECIDED TO OBSERVE THEM
trainval/V3CLRL32Mcw/50008 SO I OBSERVED MADAME CHIC OF COURSE I OBSERVED THE OTHER MOTHERS ON THE STUDY ABROAD PROGRAM I OBSERVED
trainval/V3CLRL32Mcw/50009 AND THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS NO OF COURSE NOT
trainval/V3CLRL32Mcw/50010 MEN YOU HAVE LESS CHOICE IT'S EASIER FOR YOU
trainval/V3CLRL32Mcw/50011 YOU'RE THINKING THERE'S NO WAY
trainval/V3CLRL32Mcw/50012 SO EXTRAS CAN BE THINGS LIKE T SHIRTS SWEATERS OBVIOUSLY IF YOU LIVE IN A COLD CLIMATE YOU'LL NEED LOTS OF LAYERING
trainval/V3CLRL32Mcw/50013 YOU'RE GOING TO BE MORE DISCERNING
trainval/V3CLRL32Mcw/50014 YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE PRONE TO IMPULSE BUYS ANYMORE
trainval/V3CLRL32Mcw/50015 THEY WEREN'T EXPENSIVE BUT THEY WERE THE NICEST PYJAMAS I'D EVER OWNED AS AN ADULT BECAUSE THEY WERE ACTUALLY MEANT TO
trainval/V3CLRL32Mcw/50016 IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES I REALIZED I COULD RESPECT MYSELF ENOUGH TO PRESENT MYSELF BEAUTIFULLY AT ALL
trainval/v3FDwQVb0Nw/50001 YOU HAVE TO CALL A BEE KEEPER
trainval/v3FDwQVb0Nw/50002 WE COULDN'T KNOW 100
trainval/v3FDwQVb0Nw/50003 HOW ARE YOU MAINTAINING THIS
trainval/v3FDwQVb0Nw/50004 OR KIDS ASK THEIR PARENTS TO COME DOWN
trainval/v3oSF94S4FI/50001 CAN'T YOU SEE REALITY
trainval/v3oSF94S4FI/50002 I'M TALKING INSTEAD ABOUT THREATS THAT ARE HEADED OUR WAY BUT THEY'RE WRAPPED IN A SPECIAL ENERGY FIELD THAT POLARIZES US
trainval/v3oSF94S4FI/50003 TO UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS HAPPENING TO US AND WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT WE NEED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT MORAL PSYCHOLOGY
trainval/v3oSF94S4FI/50004 IT FEELS REALLY SATISFYING
trainval/v3oSF94S4FI/50005 BUT IT IS A GROSS DISTORTION OF REALITY
trainval/v3oSF94S4FI/50006 NOBODY DOUBTS THAT THIS IS HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON
trainval/v3oSF94S4FI/50007 AND WE WILL NEVER AGAIN HAVE A LARGE GROUP OF CONSERVATIVE SOUTHERN DEMOCRATS AND
trainval/v3oSF94S4FI/50008 SO FOR A LOT OF REASONS THOSE DECADES AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR WERE AN HISTORICALLY ANOMALOUS TIME
trainval/v3oSF94S4FI/50009 THEY DON'T MEET EACH OTHER'S SPOUSES OR CHILDREN
trainval/v3oSF94S4FI/50010 THERE'S NO MORE RELATIONSHIP THERE
trainval/v3oSF94S4FI/50011 AND TRYING TO RUN CONGRESS WITHOUT HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS IS LIKE TRYING TO RUN A CAR WITHOUT MOTOR OIL
trainval/v3oSF94S4FI/50012 SOMETIMES A SINGLE THREAT CAN POLARIZE US AS WE SAW
trainval/v3oSF94S4FI/50013 THIS IS WHERE WE ARE AS A COUNTRY
trainval/v3oSF94S4FI/50014 SOME OF US ARE SITTING THERE SAFE AND SOUND IN GIGANTIC PRIVATE YACHTS
trainval/v3oSF94S4FI/50015 IT'S ALSO STABILITY VERSUS CHAOS
trainval/v3oSF94S4FI/50016 AS I KNOW FROM WORKING WITH STREET CHILDREN IN BRAZIL MOM'S BOYFRIEND IS OFTEN A REALLY REALLY DANGEROUS PERSON FOR
trainval/v3oSF94S4FI/50017 NOW THE RIGHT HAS BEEN SCREAMING ABOUT THIS ASTEROID SINCE THE 1960S AND THE LEFT HAS BEEN SAYING IT'S NOT A
trainval/v3oSF94S4FI/50018 IT'S NOT A PROBLEM
trainval/v3oSF94S4FI/50019 THE LEFT HAS BEEN VERY RELUCTANT TO SAY THAT MARRIAGE IS ACTUALLY GOOD FOR WOMEN AND FOR CHILDREN
trainval/v3oSF94S4FI/50020 WE CAN DO IT
trainval/v3SZTqj2Skw/50001 IT'S HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ANYONE WHO'S INTERESTED IN THE TRANSLATOR'S ART
trainval/v3SZTqj2Skw/50002 EVER SINCE I CAN REMEMBER THINKING CONSCIOUSLY ABOUT SUCH THINGS COMMUNICATION HAS BEEN MY CENTRAL PASSION
trainval/v3SZTqj2Skw/50003 EVEN AS A CHILD I REMEMBER THINKING THAT WHAT I REALLY WANTED MOST IN LIFE WAS TO BE ABLE TO
trainval/v3SZTqj2Skw/50004 TIME AFTER TIME WHENEVER I SET OUT TO SHARE SOME GREAT TRUTH WITH A SOON TO BE GRATEFUL RECIPIENT
trainval/v3SZTqj2Skw/50005 INTERESTINGLY WHEN YOUR OPENING LINE OF COMMUNICATION IS HEY LISTEN UP BECAUSE I'M ABOUT TO DROP SOME SERIOUS KNOWLEDGE ON
trainval/v3SZTqj2Skw/50006 IF I HAD TO PLACE IT ON AN ARBITRARY SPECTRUM I'D SAY IT FALLS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN POETRY AND LIES
trainval/v3SZTqj2Skw/50007 IT TAKES THE BASE METAL OF OUR CONVENTIONAL WISDOM AND TRANSFORMS IT THROUGH RIDICULE INTO A DIFFERENT
trainval/v3SZTqj2Skw/50008 WHICH STRUCK ME AS PARTICULARLY REMARKABLE DURING ONE SESSION WITH THE NOVEL WHEN I REALIZED THAT I WAS BEING SWEPT
trainval/v3SZTqj2Skw/50009 IT'S PART OF OUR SURVIVAL PACKAGE AND THAT'S WHY IT'S BECOME SO IMPORTANT FOR US AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE
trainval/v3SZTqj2Skw/50010 THE DESCRIPTION PERFECTLY CAPTURED EDWARDS' PERSONAL VANITY
trainval/v3SZTqj2Skw/50011 AND GUESS WHAT
trainval/v3SZTqj2Skw/50013 BUT NOT SO WITH M RQUEZ WHO ONCE PRAISED HIS TRANSLATOR'S VERSIONS AS BEING BETTER THAN HIS OWN
trainval/v3SZTqj2Skw/50014 WHY IS THIS REMOTELY CONTROVERSIAL
trainval/v3SZTqj2Skw/50015 AND THERE'S THIS MENTAL DELIGHT THAT'S FOLLOWED BY THE PHYSICAL RESPONSE OF LAUGHTER WHICH NOT COINCIDENTALLY
trainval/v3SZTqj2Skw/50016 THERE ARE FEW PHRASES THAT PACK A MORE CONCENTRATED DOSE OF SUBJECT AND SYMBOL THAN THE PERFECT
trainval/v3SZTqj2Skw/50017 PEOPLE CAN'T WAIT TO PASS ALONG THAT NEW GREAT JOKE
trainval/v3SZTqj2Skw/50018 COMEDY HAS BEEN CROSSING COUNTRY WITH REMARKABLE SPEED WAY BEFORE THE INTERNET SOCIAL MEDIA
trainval/v3SZTqj2Skw/50019 TWO DAYS AFTER THAT
trainval/v3SZTqj2Skw/50020 AND I HEARD THE EXACT SAME PUNCHLINE ON BOTH COASTS SOMETHING ABOUT THE IGNITED NEGRO COLLEGE
trainval/v3SZTqj2Skw/50021 AND HE USED TO BE THE USA TODAY MONDAY MORNING GUY
trainval/v3SZTqj2Skw/50022 I WAS VISITING WITH JOEL THE WEEKEND BEFORE THE COPENHAGEN CONFERENCE ON CLIMATE CHANGE OPENED IN DECEMBER OF
trainval/v3SZTqj2Skw/50023 BUT BACK IN 2009 THE QUESTION JOEL AND I KEPT TURNING OVER AND OVER WAS WHY THIS LATE IN THE GAME
trainval/v3SZTqj2Skw/50024 AND NOT LONG AFTER THAT HE GOT ANOTHER REQUEST FOR A COPY FROM THE HEAD OF THE EPA IN CALIFORNIA WHO USED
trainval/v3SZTqj2Skw/50025 NOW LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE FROM MY ACT
trainval/v3SZTqj2Skw/50026 AND EARLIER THIS YEAR HE GOT A REQUEST FROM THE GREEN PARTY IN AUSTRALIA WHO USED IT IN THEIR CAMPAIGN
trainval/v3SZTqj2Skw/50027 I HAVE SOME MATERIAL ABOUT THE SO CALLED RADICAL GAY AGENDA WHICH STARTS OFF BY ASKING HOW RADICAL
trainval/v3SZTqj2Skw/50028 BECAUSE FROM WHAT I CAN TELL THE THREE THINGS GAY AMERICANS SEEM TO WANT MOST ARE TO JOIN THE MILITARY GET MARRIED AND
trainval/V48M5jS6zdE/50001 SO HE DOESN'T ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING HIMSELF
trainval/V48M5jS6zdE/50002 NOW I DON'T WANT YOU ALL TO GO OUT TAKING RAPAMYCIN
trainval/V48M5jS6zdE/50003 IT IS A DRUG FOR PEOPLE BUT THE REASON IS IT SUPPRESSES THE IMMUNE SYSTEM
trainval/V48M5jS6zdE/50004 SO IT'S REALLY INTERESTING
trainval/V48M5jS6zdE/50005 AND NOBODY KNOWS IF THEY REALLY CAN LIVE FOREVER OR WHAT KEEPS THEM FROM AGING
trainval/V48M5jS6zdE/50007 IT'S MORE LIKE THAT
trainval/V4Xw76SsHOM/50001 WE NEED GRIT
trainval/V4Xw76SsHOM/50002 GRIT IS A CONCEPT DEVELOPED BY DR
trainval/v50PTSaOOGI/50001 THINK ABOUT IT
trainval/v67c9gr4XnE/50001 WOULDN'T IT BE COOL TO BE ABLE TO LOOK INSIDE THE ANKLE TO SEE WHERE THIS RESTRICTION COMES
trainval/V6yixyiJcos/50001 HOW WAS MATH EVER HUMAN IN THE FIRST PLACE
trainval/V6yixyiJcos/50002 AND THAT'S WHY KIDS ARE CONFUSED
trainval/V6yixyiJcos/50003 LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN
trainval/V6yixyiJcos/50004 JUST REMEMBER THAT MATH IS A LANGUAGE AND USE THAT TO YOUR ADVANTAGE
trainval/V6yixyiJcos/50005 SHE'S IN KINDERGARTEN
trainval/V6yixyiJcos/50006 BUT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TAKE A LANGUAGE APPROACH AND MATH BECOMES INTUITIVE AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND
trainval/V6yixyiJcos/50007 THEN I ASKED HER A QUESTION THAT KINDERGARTNERS ARE DEFINITELY NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW
trainval/V6yixyiJcos/50008 MATH IS A HUMAN LANGUAGE SO WE ALL HAVE THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND IT
trainval/V6yixyiJcos/50009 IT'S HOLDING YOU BACK
trainval/V6yixyiJcos/50010 SHE COULDN'T FACTOR OR SOLVE EQUATIONS AND SHE HAD NO CONFIDENCE IN MATH
trainval/V6yixyiJcos/50011 AS A RESULT THIS TEENAGER HAD NO CONFIDENCE IN HERSELF
trainval/V6yixyiJcos/50012 SO SHE SYSTEMATICALLY LEARNED HER TIMES TABLES IN 4 WEEKS AND YES EVEN
trainval/v7UKkzIaSsQ/50001 ACTS OF VIOLENCE COMMITTED BY OR UNDER THE NAME OF THE SELF PROCLAIMED ISLAMIC STATE OF IRAQ
trainval/v7UKkzIaSsQ/50002 THEY ARE SPRINGBOARDS FOR ACTION AND THEY ARE OUR HISTORY IN PROCESS
trainval/v7xAZ2lrel8/50001 I IT'S THE EGO
trainval/v7xAZ2lrel8/50002 THE MOST PROFOUND HALLUCINOGEN
trainval/v7xAZ2lrel8/50003 WE WOULD LEAVE
trainval/v7xAZ2lrel8/50004 THIS WAS A PROBLEM STUDENT THAT I WASN'T GETTING THROUGH TO
trainval/v7xAZ2lrel8/50005 AND I FIGURED WELL SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO ABOUT IT
trainval/v7xAZ2lrel8/50006 HE USED THE BUSINESS CARD
trainval/v7xAZ2lrel8/50007 HE MAKES THE TELEPHONE CALL
trainval/V7zMFJbBsD0/50001 DOES PARLIAMENT CHARGE LESS TAX THAN KINGS
trainval/V7zMFJbBsD0/50002 STATISTICS LOOKS BACK PROBABILITY LOOKS FORWARD
trainval/V7zMFJbBsD0/50003 WHAT AGE DID PEOPLE DIE AT
trainval/V84bSWIlNA0/50001 IN MOST OF THE CEREMONIES I NOTICED THAT MOST OF THE WOMEN AND GIRLS WERE NOT IN SIGHT
trainval/V84bSWIlNA0/50002 ONCE AT A FESTIVAL A MAN ASKED ME HOW I DARED PUT A DRUM IN BETWEEN MY LEGS
trainval/V84bSWIlNA0/50003 SOME FEAR HOW SOCIETY WILL PERCEIVE THEM
trainval/v84pD2g3gSk/50001 MEN DO YOU NEED MORE THAN ONE WIFE
trainval/v84pD2g3gSk/50002 THIS HAD HAPPENED TO EVERYBODY ELSE
trainval/v84pD2g3gSk/50003 I WAS THINKING I'M MUTILATED
trainval/v84pD2g3gSk/50005 I'M LIKE NO WHY WOULD I GET ITCHY DOWN THERE
trainval/v84pD2g3gSk/50006 WOMEN WHO ARE NOT CIRCUMCISED GET ITCHY ALL THE TIME
trainval/v84pD2g3gSk/50007 ARE THEY YOUR NEW FRIENDS KHADIJA
trainval/v84pD2g3gSk/50008 WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY FOR THAT
trainval/v84pD2g3gSk/50009 IT'S VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
trainval/v84pD2g3gSk/50010 IT'S NOT AN AFRICAN PROBLEM
trainval/v8YoSPXN7UA/50001 BUT LET'S COME BACK TO IT
trainval/v9dEgXR1iWE/50001 AT NINE HIS MOTHER DIES
trainval/v9dEgXR1iWE/50002 AT TEN HIS FATHER DIES
trainval/v9dEgXR1iWE/50003 I SAID IT'S NINE MINUTES
trainval/v9DHLMw2o70/50001 AND THAT ENCOURAGEMENT LED ME TO SHARE THOSE DUETS WITH MY CLASSMATES AND THEY ENCOURAGED
trainval/v9DHLMw2o70/50002 I DO IT WHEN I PLAY OBVIOUSLY
trainval/v9DHLMw2o70/50003 I'M NOT REALLY THINKING ABOUT COMPOSITION I'M ONLY THINKING ABOUT ARRANGING
trainval/Va07q3HFEZQ/50001 HOW DO THEY DO THAT
trainval/Va07q3HFEZQ/50002 WE ALL KNOW WE'VE BEEN MONITORED ALL OF THE TIME
trainval/Va07q3HFEZQ/50003 THIS ULTIMATELY IS GOING TO HAVE A TERRIBLE EFFECT ON THE INTERNET AND IT MIGHT GET TO THE POINT WHERE PEOPLE
trainval/Va07q3HFEZQ/50004 BECAUSE NO TERRORIST WORTH THEIR SALT IS GOING TO GIVE ANYTHING AWAY IN AN E MAIL OR ON THE
trainval/Va07q3HFEZQ/50005 OSAMA BIN LADEN DID NOT HAVE A FACEBOOK PAGE
trainval/Va07q3HFEZQ/50006 AND WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT THE BAD GUYS HAVE A WEALTH OF POSSIBILITIES WHEN THEY WANT TO
trainval/Va07q3HFEZQ/50007 HOW WOULD THEY KNOW
trainval/Va07q3HFEZQ/50009 AND EVEN IF YOU THINK SOMETHING'S FREE IT INVARIABLY ISN'T
trainval/Va07q3HFEZQ/50010 AND IT'S TRUE WHEN THEY SAY
trainval/Va07q3HFEZQ/50011 IF YOU ARE NOT PAYING YOU ARE THE PRODUCT
trainval/Va07q3HFEZQ/50012 BUT WE CAN MOVE FROM THE DEEP WEB
trainval/Va07q3HFEZQ/50013 WE CAN ALL LEARN TO BE ANONYMOUS WHEN WE CHOOSE TO BE
trainval/Va07q3HFEZQ/50014 WE SHOULD ALL BE SAYING
trainval/Va07q3HFEZQ/50015 THIS IS FAR MORE SERIOUS
trainval/VASXSkawBiY/50001 AT THIS MOMENT I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT SIERRA LEONE
trainval/VASXSkawBiY/50002 PLEASE GO DO THAT
trainval/VASXSkawBiY/50003 WE EVENTUALLY FOUND LISTS OF ALL THE HEALTHCARE FACILITIES IN ALL THE COUNTRIES BUT THESE LISTS WERE GENERATED BY
trainval/VASXSkawBiY/50004 TODAY WITH CLOUD COMPUTING IT'S CHEAP AND EASY TO BUILD OPEN DATABASES FOR PEOPLE
trainval/VB9S4kELT2k/50001 AND NO SOONER THAN SHE APPEARED SHE VANISHED
trainval/VB9S4kELT2k/50002 BECAUSE AS AN INTIMACY EXPERT I FEEL THAT INTIMACY IS THE FOUNDATION FOR
trainval/VbeekjZPSCI/50001 SO WHAT YOU DO WITH ALL THAT EMOTION IS YOU'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT
trainval/VbeovM4RCh4/50001 THE LOVE AND ACCEPTANCE THAT I WOULD GET BEING ON A STAGE WERE REAL
trainval/VbeovM4RCh4/50002 I HAVE MADE MY CLOSET MY ALLY
trainval/VbeovM4RCh4/50003 A WORLD WHERE I DON'T NEED A COSTUME IN ORDER TO FIT IN
trainval/VbF2KPn3TrU/50001 THIS WAS AT A TIME THAT TREATMENT ACTUALLY EXISTED IN RICH COUNTRIES
trainval/VbF2KPn3TrU/50002 AND THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
trainval/VbF2KPn3TrU/50003 THEY ALSO STOP PASSING ON THE VIRUS
trainval/VbF2KPn3TrU/50004 THIS IS FAIRLY RECENT SCIENCE THAT HAS SHOWN THAT
trainval/VbF2KPn3TrU/50005 WHAT THAT MEANS IS WE HAVE THE TOOLS TO BREAK THE BACK OF THIS EPIDEMIC
trainval/VbF2KPn3TrU/50006 IN 2010 UNITAID ESTABLISHED THE MEDICINES PATENT POOL FOR
trainval/VbF2KPn3TrU/50007 THIS ACTUALLY WASN'T SO GREAT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AVIATION INDUSTRY AND THIS WAS AT A
trainval/VbF2KPn3TrU/50008 AND THIS IS NO LONGER FANTASY
trainval/VbF2KPn3TrU/50009 THE COMPANY GILEAD THAT HOLDS THE PATENTS HAS LICENSED THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO THE MEDICINES
trainval/VbF2KPn3TrU/50010 THE POOL IS ALREADY WORKING TODAY TWO MONTHS LATER WITH GENERIC MANUFACTURERS TO MAKE SURE
trainval/VbF2KPn3TrU/50011 THEY WERE FORCED TO DO SO
trainval/VbF2KPn3TrU/50012 THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE MEDICINES PATENT POOL CANNOT DO
trainval/VbF2KPn3TrU/50013 IT RELIES ON THE WILLINGNESS OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO LICENSE THEIR PATENTS AND MAKE
trainval/vbHkhSfaQu8/50001 AND LOOK WE ALL DO IT
trainval/vbHkhSfaQu8/50002 THE UNCONSCIOUS BIAS IS THERE BUT WE JUST HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN MOVE PAST IT
trainval/vbHkhSfaQu8/50003 AND IF WE WANT TO CREATE A WORLD WHERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF YOUR BIRTH DON'T MATTER WE ALL HAVE TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION
trainval/vbHkhSfaQu8/50004 SHE'S AN INSPIRATION
trainval/vbKKoniUxMk/50001 WHY ARE YOU STOPPING NOW
trainval/VC0taBVUF2o/50001 IN FACT HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES ARE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO SUSTAIN CATASTROPHIC INJURIES
trainval/VC0taBVUF2o/50002 LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I'VE COME UP WITH
trainval/vC1uxXvPG0Q/50001 THERE'S MORE WHY THEIR DEADLY SYMBOL OF THE SKULL AND CROSSBONES WAS A PRECURSOR OF TODAY'S
trainval/vC1uxXvPG0Q/50002 ONCE THERE SHE SWIFTLY REALIZED THAT MORE PATIENTS WERE DYING OF INFECTIONS THAT THEY CAUGHT
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50001 I ALSO GREW UP A POOR KID
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50002 THIRD GRADERS WERE BULLYING MY SISTER SO I STOOD UP FOR HER
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50003 I WAS ALWAYS THE NEW KID THAT EVERYBODY MADE FUN OF
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50004 REALLY IT WAS ME AGAINST THE WORLD
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50005 I'VE NEVER WANTED TO HURT ANYONE
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50006 IT APPEARED AS THOUGH THE WORLD WAS OUT TO GET ME
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50007 WHAT YOU TRIPPIN' FOR
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50008 TROUBLE KNEW MY NAME AND WHERE TO FIND ME
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50009 TO MAKE IT WORSE NOBODY WAS LISTENING NOBODY CARED
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50010 IRONICALLY WHEN I LOST THE WILL TO FIGHT IS WHEN MY WHOLE WORLD COLLAPSED
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50011 MY CHILDREN WERE MY ONLY JOY AND I DIDN'T HAVE THAT ANYMORE
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50012 AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO BE HELPING ME WERE CONDEMNING ME TO HELL EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50013 SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE HAD AN OPINION THOUGH SO I SPENT MOST OF MY TIME LOCKED DOWN IN SEGREGATION
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50014 BUT I WAS ALONE AND I WAS DROWNING
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50015 I WOULD NEVER BE ACCEPTED INTO ANY COMMUNITY
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50016 SO I REVERTED TO MY OLD WAYS TO KEEP FROM LOSING MYSELF AS I FELL DEEPER INTO THE PIT
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50018 MY FACE BECAME UNRECOGNIZABLE AND LOOKED LIKE ROTTEN MASHED POTATOES
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50019 UNFORTUNATELY SO ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50020 IN 2010 THIS WOMEN'S PRISON RATED AS HAVING THE MOST VIOLENT INFRACTIONS
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50021 IT HELD 20 INMATES TWO INMATE FACILITATORS AND THREE VOLUNTEERS PACKED INTO A LITTLE 9
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50022 I EXPECTED THE WEEKEND TO END IN DISASTER AND I AVERTED MY EYES A LOT BECAUSE I WAS CERTAIN THAT IF I
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50023 HAVE YOU SEEN THIS PERSON BEFORE
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50024 PEOPLE WHO FIGHT WHOSE PRIMARY LANGUAGE IS PROFANITY
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50025 VIOLENCE IS NEVER THE ANSWER
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50026 TO JUDGE SOMEONE BEFORE ONE KNOWS THEM MAKES THE OTHER PERSON FEEL INFERIOR UNWORTHY OF
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50027 PEACE TALKS ACCEPTED OUR POSITION AS INMATES AND ACKNOWLEDGED THE HURT FROM OUR PAST
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50028 NOW IS THE TIME THAT WE NEED YOU THE MOST
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50029 BEHIND OUR TOUGH MASKS WE'RE FIGHTING FOR OUR LIVES AND YOU WON'T REACH US IF YOU DON'T PROVE
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50030 I HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT THIS AMONG MANY OTHER PROGRAMS REALLY HELPED ME TO TURN MY LIFE AROUND
trainval/VC3H1lMEeS4/50031 BUT I WONDER
trainval/vCCdmGKtxPA/50001 SHE WENT STRAIGHT TO HOSPITAL
trainval/vCCdmGKtxPA/50002 THEY OPERATED ON HER
trainval/vCCdmGKtxPA/50003 ALZHEIMER'S HEART DISEASE CANCER THESE ARE NATURAL AND WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PREVENT AND
trainval/vCCdmGKtxPA/50004 I THINK ANYONE WHO'S BEEN A PARENT KNOWS HOW THIS FEELS
trainval/vCCdmGKtxPA/50006 NOW WE COULD FIND GENES THAT COULD ACTUALLY SLOW THAT PROCESS DOWN
trainval/vCCdmGKtxPA/50007 IT WAS REALLY EXCITING
trainval/vCCdmGKtxPA/50009 AND IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WHAT WE DISCOVERED AS A GROUP WAS THAT YEAST CELLS DO IN FACT GROW OLD
trainval/vCCdmGKtxPA/50011 IN EVERY ONE OF YOUR CELLS
trainval/vCCdmGKtxPA/50012 THE SAME NUMBER OF GENES BUT THEY AREN'T ALL SWITCHED ON AT THE SAME TIME
trainval/vCCdmGKtxPA/50013 THEY WERE PROTECTED AGAINST ALZHEIMER'S
trainval/vCCdmGKtxPA/50014 THEY WERE PROTECTED AGAINST CANCER
trainval/vCCdmGKtxPA/50015 IT WAS EXTREMELY EXCITING
trainval/vCCdmGKtxPA/50016 WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
trainval/vCCdmGKtxPA/50017 WE WERE SURPRISED
trainval/vCCdmGKtxPA/50018 WE DIDN'T REALIZE RESVERATROL AND THESE DRUGS ALL WORK THE SAME WAY BUT THEY DO
trainval/vCCdmGKtxPA/50019 I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO A DAY WHEN THIS HAPPENS AND WHEN IT DOES I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO LOOK BACK AT TODAY LIKE WE DO
trainval/vcfrsYWFR78/50001 IMAGINE THE POSITIVE IMPACT THE MEMORABLE GUEST EXPERIENCES THE BRIDGES
trainval/VcMyX5R4dzs/50001 I ASKED MY EMPLOYERS TO DONATE ALL MY WAGES TO CHARITY
trainval/VcMyX5R4dzs/50002 IT'S SOMETHING ALL OF US CAN RELATE TO
trainval/VcMyX5R4dzs/50003 NO LONGER IS OUR WORK SOMETHING THAT WE MERELY ENDURE
trainval/VCRcGKpjWtU/50001 WHERE IS IT GOING NEXT
trainval/VCRcGKpjWtU/50002 AND ON ONE OF THEM I WANTED TO PUT ABOUT THE DISCUSSIONS FOR SAME SEX MARRIAGE AND I DIDN'T ACTUALLY THINK IT
trainval/VCRcGKpjWtU/50003 WHEN IS THIS RECESSION GOING TO END
trainval/VCRcGKpjWtU/50004 AND NOW EVENTUALLY I CAN SAY THAT ONE OF MY ACHIEVEMENTS WILL BE THAT I CAN GET MARRIED TO SOMEONE
trainval/VCRcGKpjWtU/50005 I KNOW RUBEN PERSONALLY FROM MY WORK AND TO COME UP HERE AND OFFER UNDERSTANDING AND AWARENESS
trainval/VCRcGKpjWtU/50006 WHO OUT THERE SHOULD BE CHANGING THE WORLD
trainval/vcSn852sv3E/50001 AND SO THE FINES STACK UP AND YOU'RE CAUGHT IN A VICIOUS CYCLE OF SELLING SEX TO PAY THE FINES YOU GOT
trainval/vcSn852sv3E/50002 CRACKDOWNS ON BUYERS DRIVE SELLERS TO TAKE DANGEROUS RISKS AND INTO THE ARMS OF POTENTIALLY ABUSIVE MANAGERS
trainval/vcSn852sv3E/50003 THESE LAWS ALSO REINFORCE STIGMA AND HATRED AGAINST SEX WORKERS
trainval/vcSn852sv3E/50004 THE SOLUTION IS CLEARLY TO GIVE WORKERS MORE LEGAL PROTECTIONS ALLOWING THEM TO RESIST ABUSE AND REPORT IT TO
trainval/vcSn852sv3E/50005 THE WAY THE TERM TRAFFICKING IS THROWN AROUND IMPLIES THAT ALL UNDOCUMENTED MIGRATION INTO PROSTITUTION IS
trainval/vcSn852sv3E/50006 PEOPLE GET REALLY HUNG UP ON THE QUESTION WELL WOULD YOU WANT YOUR DAUGHTER DOING IT
trainval/vcxwcWuq7KQ/50001 LITTLE GIRLS ARE AMAZING
trainval/vcxwcWuq7KQ/50002 AND WHAT IF
trainval/vcxwcWuq7KQ/50003 OR HOW DOES THE COMPUTER KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I PRESS PLAY' HOW DOES IT KNOW WHICH VIDEO TO
trainval/vdDFLzyk94k/50001 YOUTH HAVE THE LOWEST VOTER TURNOUT AT ABOUT 37 FOR THOSE UNDER THE AGE OF
trainval/vdDFLzyk94k/50002 AND WE'VE ALL HEARD THE INSULTS AGAINST YOUTH IN POLITICS THAT YOUTH ARE DROPPING OUT OF POLITICS THAT WE'RE
trainval/vdDFLzyk94k/50003 COMPARE THAT THOUGH TO 38 LESS THAN 38 OF THOSE UNDER THE
trainval/vdDFLzyk94k/50004 AND IN THE LAST CANADIAN ELECTION THE FEDERAL ELECTION NOT THE ONE THAT TOOK PLACE YESTERDAY WAS CHARACTERIZED BY
trainval/vdDFLzyk94k/50005 SO WHY ARE WE SEEING PARTICIPATION CHANGE
trainval/vdDFLzyk94k/50006 WHY ARE WE SEEING ENGAGEMENT CHANGE FORMS
trainval/vdDFLzyk94k/50007 IT SEEMS THAT FOR YOUTH POLITICS' HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH SELF SERVING NARROW
trainval/vdDFLzyk94k/50008 AND THERE'S ALSO A FAILURE IN INTERPRETING YOUTH ACTIVISM AND ENGAGEMENT BACK
trainval/vdDFLzyk94k/50009 IT IS THIS LACK OF MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING THAT PLAGUES THESE ATTEMPTS
trainval/vdDFLzyk94k/50010 BUT WHAT I AM TRYING TO SAY IS WE NEED TO RE EXAMINE HOW YOUTH AND POLITICS
trainval/vdDFLzyk94k/50011 THINGS LIKE THE H
trainval/vdDFLzyk94k/50012 AND THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THOSE WHO ENGAGE IN SOME FORM OF ALTERNATIVE
trainval/VEFM905EOUk/50001 AMERICA'S YOUNG WOMEN ARE RUNNING OUT OF OXYGEN
trainval/VehHPwAVL9g/50001 AND 3 MONTH LATER I LANDED DOWN A DATE WITH HIM
trainval/VehHPwAVL9g/50002 I GO IN ON WITH THE 500 PLUS JOURNAL ARTICLES I HAVE READ
trainval/VehHPwAVL9g/50003 WHAT I FOUND ON THE INTERNET WAS EYE BOGGLING
trainval/VehHPwAVL9g/50004 THE AVERAGE SURVIVAL TIME IS ABOUT 3 MONTHS
trainval/VehHPwAVL9g/50005 IT MISSES OVER 30 PERCENT OF ALL PANCREATIC CANCERS
trainval/VehHPwAVL9g/50006 IT COSTS OVER 800 DOLLARS AND IT IS NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE PLAN
trainval/VehHPwAVL9g/50007 SO IT'S NOT AN OPTION TO LOWER INCOME PATIENTS
trainval/VehHPwAVL9g/50008 IN ADDITION IT IS RARELY ORDERED BECAUSE PANCREATIC CANCER IS WHAT WE CALL NON SYMPTOMATIC DISEASE
trainval/VehHPwAVL9g/50009 IT DOESN'T SHOW ANY SYMPTOMS
trainval/VehHPwAVL9g/50010 USUALLY THEY ARE JUST LIKE REALLY RANDOM SYMPTOMS LIKE ABDOMINAL PAIN
trainval/VehHPwAVL9g/50011 WHAT I FOUND IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THIS TINY BIOMARKER OF PROTEIN THAT IS FOUND IN YOUR BLOOD
trainval/VehHPwAVL9g/50012 AND THAT SOUNDS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT IT'S ANYTHING BUT
trainval/VehHPwAVL9g/50013 THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOUR BLOOD IT IS ALREADY ABUNDANT IN PROTEINS
trainval/VehHPwAVL9g/50014 YOU HAVE LITERS AND LITERS OF IT IN YOUR BODY
trainval/VehHPwAVL9g/50015 SO FIND THIS TINY INCREASE IN THIS TINY AMOUNT OF PROTEIN IN THERE IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
trainval/VehHPwAVL9g/50016 THEN WHAT I REALIZED IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO IS KIND OF LIKE FIND A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK
trainval/VehHPwAVL9g/50018 I FINALLY FOUND THIS ONE PROTEIN AND I WAS NEXT TO INSANITY THERE
trainval/VehHPwAVL9g/50019 SO IF YOU COULD DETECT THIS YOU WOULD BARELY HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE CANCER THEN
trainval/VehHPwAVL9g/50020 SHE STORMS UP RED IN THE FACE
trainval/VehHPwAVL9g/50021 SHE IS LIKE WHAT ARE YOU DOING YOUNG MAN
trainval/VehHPwAVL9g/50023 AND I GOT 199 REJECTIONS OUT OF THOSE 200 AND 1 LUKEWARM MAYBE
trainval/VehHPwAVL9g/50024 I HAVE REALIZED MY PROCEDURE WASN'T AS PERFECT AS I HAD INITIALLY THOUGHT
trainval/VekRvcbL4yk/50001 AND THE WOMAN HAS NOT CRIED SINCE
trainval/vEli4dfAXrM/50001 SO IT'S JUST A PLACE WHERE THERE WAS NO RULE OF LAW
trainval/vEli4dfAXrM/50002 SHE WAS PREGNANT AT THE TIME
trainval/vEli4dfAXrM/50003 SHE HAD CIGARETTE BURNS ON HER
trainval/vEli4dfAXrM/50004 AND WHEN THEY BROUGHT HER CASE TO THE JUDGE FOR THE FIRST TIME HE STOOD UP AND HE SAID YES THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
trainval/vEli4dfAXrM/50005 BUT CAMBODIA IS NOT ALONE
trainval/vEli4dfAXrM/50006 I USED TO THINK WELL IS IT CAMBODIA
trainval/vEli4dfAXrM/50007 OR IS IT OTHER COUNTRIES
trainval/vEli4dfAXrM/50008 OR A WOMAN I PICKED UP HER BABY REALLY CUTE BABY I SAID YOUR BABY IS SO CUTE
trainval/vEli4dfAXrM/50009 IT WASN'T A BABY SHE WAS THREE
trainval/vEli4dfAXrM/50010 A JUDGE WOULD LET HER OUT
trainval/vEli4dfAXrM/50011 WHAT CAN WE DO
trainval/vEli4dfAXrM/50012 SO LAWYERS BEGAN TO COURAGEOUSLY STAND UP TOGETHER TO ORGANIZE A SYSTEM WHERE THEY CAN TAKE CASES
trainval/vEli4dfAXrM/50013 THEY WERE TORTURING EVERYBODY ALL THE TIME
trainval/vEli4dfAXrM/50014 WHAT'S GOING ON
trainval/vEli4dfAXrM/50015 AND THEY SHOWED ME A MANUAL WHICH ACTUALLY WAS AN EXCELLENT MANUAL
trainval/vEli4dfAXrM/50016 I SAID I'M GONNA COPY THIS
trainval/vEli4dfAXrM/50017 IT HAD EVERYTHING IN IT
trainval/vEli4dfAXrM/50018 IT WAS PERFECT
trainval/vEli4dfAXrM/50019 BUT I SAID TO THEM I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION WHICH IS BY THE TIME THAT EVERYBODY GOT TO THE PROSECUTOR'S
trainval/vEli4dfAXrM/50020 AND AFTER A PAUSE THEY SAID THEY HAD BEEN TORTURED
trainval/vEli4dfAXrM/50022 THIS IS FANTASTIC
trainval/vEli4dfAXrM/50023 AND MOST OF THE PRISONERS SAID THAT HE WAS THEIR GREATEST JOY AND THEIR SUNSHINE AND THEY LOOKED FORWARD TO HIM
trainval/vEli4dfAXrM/50024 WE HAVE A PROGRAM CALLED JUSTICEMAKERS AND WE REALIZED THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE COURAGEOUS AND WANT TO DO THINGS
trainval/vEli4dfAXrM/50025 HE WAS BORN IN A PRISON WITH ALMOST NOTHING NO MATERIAL GOODS BUT HE HAD A SENSE OF HIS OWN HEROIC JOURNEY WHICH I
trainval/vEli4dfAXrM/50026 BUT I'M ONE
trainval/vEli4dfAXrM/50027 SO IT'S AN ONLINE CONTEST WHERE IT'S ONLY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IF YOU COME UP WITH AND INNOVATIVE WAY OF IMPLEMENTING
trainval/VeXCU8cjIlw/50001 I FIRST MET VITALY IN THE SPRING OF LAST YEAR
trainval/VFaQtPw3Va4/50001 I KNEW VERY LITTLE OF THEM AS PEOPLE
trainval/VFaQtPw3Va4/50002 HER HAIR WAS TANGLED BLACK AND WILD
trainval/VfKWd7iXMSo/50001 DO WE HAVE A VISA
trainval/VfKWd7iXMSo/50002 HISTORIANS MIGHT ACTUALLY GO FURTHER SAY THAT IT'S A FOREIGN COUNTRY THAT IT'S ACTUALLY AN IMAGINARY COUNTRY THAT IS MORE
trainval/VfKWd7iXMSo/50003 IS THE PAST A FOREIGN COUNTRY
trainval/VfKWd7iXMSo/50004 THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL WHICH HAS ERIC BANA SCARLETT JOHANSSON NATALIE PORTMAN RE IMMAGINES
trainval/VfKWd7iXMSo/50005 A FILM LIKE THE DUCHESS WHICH IS THE STORY OF AN 18TH CENTURY ARISTOCRAT HAD THE STRAP LINE
trainval/VfKWd7iXMSo/50006 THAT IS OF COURSE THE FIRST LINE OF L
trainval/VfKWd7iXMSo/50007 ONE ACADEMIC WE WORKED WITH SAID HE HAD ALWAYS KNOWN THAT BUT IT WAS ONLY WHEN HE SAW IT ON THIS DOORWAY WHICH LOOKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE A
trainval/VfKWd7iXMSo/50008 HISTORY DOESN'T REPEAT ITSELF BUT IT RHYMES SAID MARK TWAIN
trainval/VfKWd7iXMSo/50009 I'M GOING TO PUT IT LIKE THIS
trainval/VfKWd7iXMSo/50010 AGAIN THE QUESTION COMES TO US
trainval/VfKWd7iXMSo/50011 THEY MARKET THEMSELVES AS HISTORY WITH THE NASTY BITS LEFT IN
trainval/VfKWd7iXMSo/50012 OF COURSE WE ARE SLIGHTLY PERVERSELY FASCINATED BY GORE
trainval/VfKWd7iXMSo/50013 HOW ABOUT RELIGION
trainval/VfKWd7iXMSo/50014 HISTORICAL CHARACTERS LIKE CHROMEWELL FOR EXAMPLE FROM HER OWN IMAGINATION AS IS THE NOVELIST'S PREROGATIVE
trainval/VfKWd7iXMSo/50015 IN 1572 A NEW STATUTE SUGGESTED THAT THEY SHOULD BE GRIEVOUSLY WHIPPED AND THEY SHOULD BE BRANDED THROUGH THE EAR
trainval/VfKWd7iXMSo/50016 WOMEN PERHAPS THIS IS THE MOST BIZARRE ONE OF ALL SINCE THE TIME OF ARISTOTLE THROUGH TILL ABOUT THE 18TH CENTURY WHERE
trainval/VfKWd7iXMSo/50017 OCCASIONALLY THEY HAD STORIES CIRCULATING OF A WOMAN OR A GIRL LEAPING OVER A FENCE AND THEN
trainval/VfKWd7iXMSo/50018 WE NEED TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND IT
trainval/vFPkEIGUofc/50001 AND IF YOU DO FIND OUT YOU MIGHT BE ALARMED TO LEARN THIS POLICY IS AGAINST YOUR WISHES WHATEVER THAT WISH MAY
trainval/vFPkEIGUofc/50002 IF YOU ARE IN CHARGE OF PEOPLE RISKING THEIR LIVES IN SERVICE COPS SOLDIERS FIRE FIGHTERS
trainval/vFPkEIGUofc/50003 PUSH TO CHANGE CURRENT POLICIES AND LAWS
trainval/vFPkEIGUofc/50004 AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50001 AND WHEN WE GET SCARED OF SOMETHING VERY OFTEN WE STOP TALKING ABOUT IT
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50002 WE DON'T TALK ABOUT DEATH AND DYING VERY OFTEN
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50003 I'M A DEATH EDUCATOR AND A DEATH RESEARCHER AND THAT MAKES ME A LITTLE CRAZY
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50004 I HAD HAD A DREAM THAT HE WAS SITTING IN A CHAIR HIS LEGS CROSSED READING A BOOK
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50005 I'M TAKING A LITTLE BREAK TO THE RIGHT AND THERE WAS A ROOM THERE
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50006 THE NIGHT SHE DIED MY MOM WAS REACHING UP TOWARDS SOMETHING I COULDN'T SEE AND I DIDN'T KNOW THEN THAT THAT WAS PART OF DEATHBED
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50007 PEOPLE SEE LANDSCAPES
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50008 THERE WERE FLOWERS
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50009 AND THE STORY WENT THAT THERE WAS A BOY THERE THAT WAS DYING
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50010 SHE SAID WHO'S THERE
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50011 THERE WERE PEOPLE TALKING
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50012 ONE WIFE SAID TO ME SHE WAS TALKING TO HER HUSBAND ONE AFTERNOON AND SAID DO YOU EVER SEE ANYBODY OR
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50013 SHE SAID I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50014 MR HARRISON THE LAST TWO WEEKS OF HIS LIFE AND KEPT HIM COMPANY AND HELPED HIS TRANSITION BEING AN EASIER
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50015 WITNESSES TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THE PHENOMENA THAT WERE HAPPENING WERE SIGNS THAT DEATH
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50016 THEY'VE GOT TO GET SOMEWHERE
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50017 FOR THAT MOM AND FOR OTHER FOLKS IN MY RESEARCH THESE VISIONS THESE DEATHBED PHENOMENA
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50018 HE WAS READY
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50019 I GOT A TEXT ONE AFTERNOON FROM HIS DAUGHTER THAT THE VISIONS HAD STARTED AND EVERYTHING WAS OKAY
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50020 HIS DAUGHTER TALKED ABOUT HOW BUTCH WAS OFTEN IN THE OTHER ROOM
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50021 AND HE WAS OFTEN IN THE OTHER ROOM
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50022 THEY LEFT SHORTER LADDERS
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50023 I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THEM
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50024 THIS IS A VERY COMMON METAPHOR FOR THE DYING
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50025 SO ONE AFTERNOON I FORGOT TO SAY
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50026 BUTCH WAS A PRETTY FAMOUS RUGBY PLAYER IN SOUTH AFRICA IN HIS DAY
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50027 I'M GOING TO GO GET A DRINK
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50028 I WANT TO HEAR YOUR STORY
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50029 PLEASE TELL ME YOUR STORY
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50030 NOW HIS FAMILY HAD ALSO COME
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50031 HIS PARENTS HAD COME HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50032 BUT THERE WAS THE RUGBY TEAM
trainval/vg8WAv0YT9c/50033 CAME DOWN STAYED WITH HIM AND THEY HAD A REALLY BIG PARTY
trainval/vGDZmSnSkfo/50001 IF YOU WERE GIVEN 150 YEARS OR 200 YEARS OR AS LONG AS YOU
trainval/vGDZmSnSkfo/50002 WHY DID THEY STOP DIVIDING AND DIE
trainval/vGDZmSnSkfo/50003 THAT MEANS OUR PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS ARE ALREADY IMPOSED
trainval/vGDZmSnSkfo/50004 THE SECOND MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERY HAPPENED IN 2000 ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO
trainval/vGDZmSnSkfo/50005 IF YOUR HEART STOPS WORKING THEN YOU WILL HAVE A HEART DISEASE AND SKIN PROBLEMS THINGS LIKE THAT
trainval/vGDZmSnSkfo/50006 AND THOSE ARE THE BARRIERS WE WANT TO OVERCOME
trainval/vGDZmSnSkfo/50007 IT'S NOT EXACTLY AN EMBRYO
trainval/vGDZmSnSkfo/50008 BMP2 IS A NATURAL SIGNAL THAT TELLS THE CELL TO TURN INTO BONE
trainval/vGDZmSnSkfo/50009 AND THAT TECHNOLOGY IS THE FIRST TECHNOLOGY THAT I JUST TOLD YOU ABOUT
trainval/vGDZmSnSkfo/50010 THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS DURING THE PROCESS OF WHAT WE CALL DEVELOPMENT
trainval/vGDZmSnSkfo/50011 SO AFTER THREE MONTHS IT REMAINS LIKE A HOLE
trainval/vGDZmSnSkfo/50012 WITH BMP2 NATURAL SIGNALS SOAKED INTO A PIECE OF SPONGE AND PUT IT ON TO THAT
trainval/vGDZmSnSkfo/50013 AND YOU CAN SEE X RAY PHOTOGRAPHY UNDERNEATH SO THAT YOU CAN SEE A SIGNIFICANT RECOVERY
trainval/vGDZmSnSkfo/50014 AND I THINK PEOPLE CAN REALIZE THAT WE ARE NOT REALLY BOUND BY
trainval/vGDZmSnSkfo/50015 IT'S CALLED MUTATIONS
trainval/vGDZmSnSkfo/50016 IT HAPPENS IN CANCER PATIENTS
trainval/vGDZmSnSkfo/50017 WE CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE THOSE GENETIC DEFECTS THAT YOU'RE BORN WITH AND SOME PEOPLE
trainval/vGDZmSnSkfo/50018 LET ME END MY THOUGHTS WITH THE FOLLOWING TWO SLIDES
trainval/vGDZmSnSkfo/50019 IN FACT EVEN AS OF NOW MY BODY CONSISTS OF 37 TRILLION CELLS I
trainval/vGDZmSnSkfo/50020 IT MAY BE BASED ON OUR GENOMES BUT IT MAY NOT BE OUR BODY ANYMORE
trainval/vGDZmSnSkfo/50021 BUT AT LEAST I THINK I GAVE YOU A RIGHT QUESTION TO PONDER ON
trainval/vGDZmSnSkfo/50022 AND THIS IS MY THOUGHT
trainval/vGDZmSnSkfo/50023 THIS IS MY SOLUTION
trainval/vGDZmSnSkfo/50024 I AM NOT REALLY DEFINED BY MY BODY
trainval/VGpZ06RlVfI/50001 MOST OF ITS STUDENTS ARE GIRLS
trainval/VGpZ06RlVfI/50002 THE VAST MAJORITY ARE MEDIUM ACADEMIC ACHIEVERS AND THEY ARRIVE FROM FAMILIES WITH
trainval/VGpZ06RlVfI/50003 I WAS BORN TO A POOR FAMILY
trainval/VGpZ06RlVfI/50004 MY DAD WAS A BAKER AND MY MOM WAS A HOUSEKEEPER
trainval/VGpZ06RlVfI/50005 AND ONE SALARY WAS EXPECTED TO SUPPORT TEN PERSONS
trainval/VGpZ06RlVfI/50006 AT THAT TIME I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT AS I DO TODAY
trainval/VGUnvr6ImOo/50001 ALSO OUR SOCIETY IS MORE AND MORE BECOMING A PERFORMANCE BASED SOCIETY
trainval/VGUnvr6ImOo/50002 AND THEY ACCEPT MORE OF BOYS THAN WOMEN
trainval/vGzBcBZrOSw/50001 AND THEN I WRITE ABOUT IT ON MY BLOG SO I'M TELLING PEOPLE HERE'S HOW YOU GROW A TOMATO AND THEN I'M
trainval/vhfcedpoCLo/50001 NOW HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE EVER WANTED TO ASK A QUESTION BUT HELD BACK
trainval/vhfcedpoCLo/50002 THAT'S THE NEXT QUESTION
trainval/vhfcedpoCLo/50003 MY NAME IS JESSICA AND TODAY I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT MY CRAZY EXPERIMENTS INTO
trainval/vhfcedpoCLo/50004 IT MEANT THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IF YOU DON'T WANT ME TO KNOW SOMETHING THAT IS SECRETIVE AND
trainval/vhfcedpoCLo/50005 I SAID XAVI WHAT DO YOU MEAN
trainval/vhfcedpoCLo/50006 AND IF WE COULD MATCH THAT WITH HIS SPEECH AND WHAT HE WAS TELLING US WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING HOW MUCH BETTER WOULD WE
trainval/vhfcedpoCLo/50007 I WANT US ALL TO BE AGENTS OF CHANGE
trainval/vhhgI4tSMwc/50001 BUT I DIDN'T HANDLE IT
trainval/vhhgI4tSMwc/50002 THAT'S WHAT PSYCHOLOGISTS CALL AN AHA
trainval/vhhgI4tSMwc/50003 THAT WAS THE MOMENT I REALIZED 30 IS NOT THE NEW 20
trainval/vhhgI4tSMwc/50004 MOMENTS THAT MAKE YOUR LIFE WHAT IT IS WILL HAVE HAPPENED BY YOUR MID 30S
trainval/vhhgI4tSMwc/50005 PEOPLE WHO ARE OVER 40 DON'T PANIC
trainval/vhhgI4tSMwc/50006 BUT WHAT WE HEAR LESS ABOUT IS THAT THERE'S SUCH A THING AS ADULT DEVELOPMENT AND OUR 20S ARE THAT CRITICAL
trainval/vhhgI4tSMwc/50007 SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS WHEN YOU PAT A TWENTYSOMETHING ON THE HEAD AND YOU SAY YOU HAVE 10 EXTRA YEARS TO START YOUR
trainval/vhhgI4tSMwc/50008 NOW WHEN I HEARD THIS I WAS SO RELIEVED
trainval/vhhgI4tSMwc/50009 MY CLASSMATE GOT AN ARSONIST FOR HER FIRST CLIENT
trainval/vhhgI4tSMwc/50010 IT'S A STORY ABOUT A WOMAN NAMED EMMA
trainval/vhhgI4tSMwc/50011 SHE LOVES HER NEW CAREER SHE LOVES HER NEW FAMILY AND SHE SENT ME A CARD THAT SAID NOW THE
trainval/vHhn7z6BA0w/50001 SO IT'S NOT REALLY A CASE OF MARS AND VENUS
trainval/vHhn7z6BA0w/50002 IT'S MORE A CASE OF IF ANYTHING MARS AND SNICKERS
trainval/vHhn7z6BA0w/50003 BASICALLY THE SAME BUT YOU KNOW ONE'S MAYBE SLIGHTLY NUTTIER THAN THE OTHER
trainval/vHhn7z6BA0w/50004 IF YOU THINK THEY'RE FIGHTING THAT MEANS YOU'RE A BIT MORE OF A NASTY AGGRESSIVE PERSON
trainval/vHhn7z6BA0w/50006 IN FACT ONE RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT WHEN YOU DO TRY TO DIAGNOSE PEOPLE'S PERSONALITY USING RORSCHACH INKBLOT TESTS
trainval/vHhn7z6BA0w/50007 SO BY COMPARING HOW SIMILAR GCSE RESULTS ARE IN IDENTICAL TWINS VERSUS NON IDENTICAL
trainval/vHhn7z6BA0w/50008 BUT AGAIN THIS IS A MYTH BECAUSE NEARLY EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO INVOLVES NEARLY ALL PARTS OF YOUR BRAIN TALKING TOGETHER
trainval/vHhn7z6BA0w/50009 HOWEVER PERHAPS ONE REASON WHY THIS MYTH HAS SURVIVED IS THAT THERE IS A SLIGHT GRAIN OF TRUTH TO IT
trainval/vHhn7z6BA0w/50010 AND THEY PLAYED THE PEOPLE THE MUSIC OR THE STORIES
trainval/vHhn7z6BA0w/50011 THE PEOPLE WHO PREFERRED MOZART MUSIC TO THE STORIES GOT A BIGGER IQ BOOST FROM THE MOZART THAN THE STORIES BUT THE PEOPLE WHO
trainval/vHhn7z6BA0w/50012 SO A FAMOUS STUDY SURVEYED PEOPLE FROM 37 DIFFERENT CULTURES ACROSS THE GLOBE FROM AMERICANS TO ZULUS ON WHAT THEY
trainval/vHhn7z6BA0w/50013 BUT IN FACT WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IF YOU ANALYZE THE PATTERN OF HITS AND MISSES STATISTICALLY IT
trainval/vHhn7z6BA0w/50014 YOUR BRAIN CREATES PATTERNS FROM THE RANDOMNESS
trainval/vHhn7z6BA0w/50015 A RECENT STUDY LOOKING AT PENALTY SHOOTOUTS IN FOOTBALL SHOWS THAT PLAYERS WHO REPRESENT COUNTRIES WITH A
trainval/vHhn7z6BA0w/50016 BUT THIS STORY IS A MYTH FOR THREE REASONS
trainval/vHhn7z6BA0w/50018 OKAY SO I'VE BEEN TALKING FOR ABOUT 12 MINUTES NOW AND YOU'VE PROBABLY BEEN SITTING THERE LISTENING TO ME ANALYZING MY SPEECH
trainval/vHhn7z6BA0w/50019 MAYBE WE COULD LISTEN TO A NICE BIT OF MOZART
trainval/vHhn7z6BA0w/50020 SO HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE IDEA OF THE MOZART EFFECT
trainval/Vi8k6BG9KVk/50001 THE WORD JIHAD STANDS FOR ALL THOSE MEANINGS AS A WHOLE
trainval/Vi8k6BG9KVk/50002 SO I BECAME INVOLVED IN THE JIHAD IN AFGHANISTAN
trainval/Vi8k6BG9KVk/50003 I WANTED TO PROTECT THE MUSLIM AFGHAN POPULATION AGAINST THE SOVIET ARMY
trainval/Vi8k6BG9KVk/50004 AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS JIHAD
trainval/Vi8k6BG9KVk/50005 AND IT WAS THE SAME EVERYWHERE
trainval/Vi8k6BG9KVk/50006 I WAS COMPLETELY IMMERSED IN IT
trainval/Vi8k6BG9KVk/50007 THEY CAN REGAIN THEIR HEARTS AND RESTORE THEM BY FILLING THEM WITH HUMAN VALUES THAT HEAL
trainval/Vi8k6BG9KVk/50008 BUT NOW I BEGAN TO QUESTION HOW I KNEW WHAT I KNEW
trainval/Vi8k6BG9KVk/50009 APPROACH THE WORLD LIFE WITH LOVE
trainval/vIme03wdEFU/50001 IF WE KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT THE POLAR VORTEX WHY ARE THE WEATHER MEASUREMENTS SO OFF
trainval/Vj3gCWmJSiE/50001 THIS MEANS THE LOSS OF BEACHES AND THE LOSS OF LANDS AND THIS LAND BEING LOST IS LOST IN PIRAMBU
trainval/vJ66jv8ICjc/50001 I THINK OF IT AS A 21ST CENTURY BUDDHA
trainval/VjQ3ufqnfSM/50001 EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW RIGHT
trainval/VjQ3ufqnfSM/50002 MINE IS CUT OFF BECAUSE IT'S NOT VALID ANYMORE I GOT MYSELF A NEW ONE
trainval/VjQ3ufqnfSM/50003 THAT'S THE KIRPAN
trainval/VJRBx0JjMSM/50001 I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT'S NEEDED TO PROTECT OTHER SEX WORKERS FROM THESE THINGS
trainval/VJRBx0JjMSM/50002 MAYBE YOU'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THEM TOO
trainval/VJRBx0JjMSM/50003 BUT IF YOU'RE FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN OBEYING THE LAW AND FEEDING YOURSELF OR YOUR FAMILY YOU'RE GOING TO DO THE WORK ANYWAY AND
trainval/VJRBx0JjMSM/50006 ASSUMING YOU STILL NEED MONEY YOU'LL STAY IN THE MORE FLEXIBLE INFORMAL ECONOMY
trainval/VJRBx0JjMSM/50007 BEING CRIMINALIZED LEAVES YOU EXPOSED TO MISTREATMENT BY THE STATE ITSELF
trainval/VJRBx0JjMSM/50008 IMAGINE KNOWING IF YOU'RE BUSTED CARRYING CONDOMS IT'LL BE USED AGAINST YOU
trainval/VJRBx0JjMSM/50009 WOULD YOU PACK CONDOMS TO GO TO WORK
trainval/VJRBx0JjMSM/50010 AND SO THE FINES STACK UP AND YOU'RE CAUGHT IN A VICIOUS CYCLE OF SELLING SEX TO PAY THE FINES YOU GOT
trainval/VJRBx0JjMSM/50011 IF YOU NEED THAT MONEY THE ONLY EFFECT THAT A DROP IN BUSINESS IS GOING HAVE IS TO FORCE YOU TO LOWER YOUR PRICES OR OFFER MORE
trainval/VJRBx0JjMSM/50012 CRACKDOWNS ON BUYERS DRIVE SELLERS TO TAKE DANGEROUS RISKS AND INTO THE ARMS OF POTENTIALLY ABUSIVE MANAGERS
trainval/VJRBx0JjMSM/50013 THESE LAWS ALSO REINFORCE STIGMA AND HATRED AGAINST SEX WORKERS
trainval/VJRBx0JjMSM/50014 WHEN FRANCE TEMPORARILY BROUGHT IN THE SWEDISH MODEL TWO YEARS AGO ORDINARY CITIZENS TOOK IT AS A CUE TO START
trainval/VJRBx0JjMSM/50015 IF PROHIBITION IS THIS HARMFUL YOU MIGHT ASK WHY IS IT SO POPULAR
trainval/VJRBx0JjMSM/50016 FIRSTLY SEX WORK IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN A SURVIVAL STRATEGY FOR ALL KINDS OF UNPOPULAR MINORITY GROUPS
trainval/VJRBx0JjMSM/50017 THESE LAWS HAVE POLITICAL SUPPORT PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY TARGET PEOPLE THAT VOTERS DON'T WANT TO SEE
trainval/VJRBx0JjMSM/50018 IN FACT MANY MIGRANTS HAVE MADE A DECISION OUT OF ECONOMIC NEED TO PLACE THEMSELVES INTO THE HANDS OF PEOPLE
trainval/VJRBx0JjMSM/50019 BUT IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE SAFE WHEN THEY DO THEM
trainval/VJRBx0JjMSM/50020 AS A FEMINIST I KNOW THAT THE SEX INDUSTRY IS A SITE OF DEEPLY ENTRENCHED SOCIAL
trainval/VJRBx0JjMSM/50021 HERE IN THE UK I'M PART OF SEX WORKER LED GROUPS LIKE THE SEX WORKER OPEN UNIVERSITY AND THE ENGLISH COLLECTIVE OF
trainval/VJRBx0JjMSM/50022 AND WE FORM PART OF A GLOBAL MOVEMENT DEMANDING DECRIMINALIZATION AND SELF DETERMINATION
trainval/VJRBx0JjMSM/50023 IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AN OPTION FOR SOMEONE WHO'S DESPERATE AND NEEDS MONEY TONIGHT
trainval/VJRBx0JjMSM/50024 SEX WORKERS ARE REAL PEOPLE
trainval/VJRBx0JjMSM/50025 YOU CAN ASK EXPENSIVE ESCORTS IN NEW YORK CITY BROTHEL WORKERS IN CAMBODIA STREET WORKERS IN SOUTH AFRICA
trainval/vkEeNkHilIg/50001 THERE IS ONE PATHOLOGIST FOR EVERY CASE
trainval/vkEeNkHilIg/50002 WE HAVE A TEAM
trainval/VktGgoVvgXo/50001 AND THERE WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COBALT BLUE EXPANSE
trainval/VktGgoVvgXo/50002 WELL I TOO FELT THIS PIT OF EXITEMENT INSIDE ME
trainval/VktGgoVvgXo/50003 AND AS MUCH IS THE EXPLORER IN ALL OF US YEARNS TO BE FREE AND AS MUCH WE TRY TO EXPLORE ALL THAT WE CAN
trainval/VktGgoVvgXo/50004 ACCORDING TO THE NOAA THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERE ADMINISTRATION THE OCEAN
trainval/VktGgoVvgXo/50005 I'M NOT A PERSON WHO HATES THE OCEAN
trainval/VktGgoVvgXo/50006 BUT I'VE ALWAYS HAD A FEAR OF SHARKS AND WHAT LAID DEEP BENEATH ME IN THE WATER
trainval/VktGgoVvgXo/50007 OUR PLAN WAS TO SNORKEL OVER IT
trainval/VktGgoVvgXo/50008 THE MEDIA PORTRAYS THESE CREATURES AS MONSTERS KILLING MACHINES
trainval/VktGgoVvgXo/50009 I'M SURE EVERYONE HERE HAS DONE SOME GREAT AND PRETTY COOL THINGS
trainval/VKwFSRsaoY0/50001 AND HOW CAN MEN TAME EAGLES
trainval/VKwFSRsaoY0/50002 I WAS DESPERATE TO GO AND FIND OUT FOR MYSELF
trainval/VKwFSRsaoY0/50003 THAT WAS MY CUE
trainval/VKwFSRsaoY0/50004 SO I MAKE A BUNCH OF PHONE CALLS I BUY A TICKET OF COURSE
trainval/VKwFSRsaoY0/50005 WITHIN 72 HOURS I'M ON A PLANE HEADING NORTH
trainval/VKwFSRsaoY0/50006 AND THEY RUSH BACK HOME
trainval/VL5zqmpiJlQ/50001 I'VE DISCOVERED HOW I SHOW UP AND HOW I MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES
trainval/VlC93dig40E/50001 IT MEANS ROOM
trainval/VlC93dig40E/50002 I THINK IT WAS UP ON THAT SLIDE
trainval/VlC93dig40E/50003 AND YOU PUT THIS ON TOP OF ANOTHER PIECE OF PAPER THAT'S COATED WITH SILVER NITRATE AND YOU EXPOSE THE BACK TO SOME
trainval/VlC93dig40E/50004 SO PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK THAT TECHNOLOGY IS NOTHING MORE THAN THIS CANDY STORE THEY CAN GO INTO AND IF THEY
trainval/VLe84OkwKOA/50001 THEY DON'T COUNT IN LAW
trainval/VLe84OkwKOA/50002 THEY DON'T HAVE ANY LEGAL RIGHTS
trainval/VLe84OkwKOA/50003 AND SO ARE BOOKS YOU MIGHT HAVE OR THE CARS YOU OWN
trainval/VLe84OkwKOA/50004 AN ENRAGED CHARLES STEWART THEN HIRED SLAVE CATCHERS TO CANVASS THE CITY OF LONDON FIND HIM
trainval/VLe84OkwKOA/50006 THE NONHUMAN RIGHTS PROJECT ARGUES THAT DRAWING A LINE IN ORDER TO ENSLAVE AN AUTONOMOUS AND SELF DETERMINING BEING LIKE YOU'RE
trainval/VLe84OkwKOA/50007 WE KNOW THE EXTRAORDINARY COGNITIVE CAPABILITIES THAT THEY HAVE AND THEY ALSO RESEMBLE THE KIND THAT HUMAN BEINGS
trainval/VLe84OkwKOA/50008 THEY HAVE A SYMBOLIC CULTURE
trainval/VLe84OkwKOA/50009 THEY'RE TWO YOUNG MALE CHIMPANZEES WHO ARE BEING USED FOR BIOMEDICAL ANATOMICAL RESEARCH AT STONY BROOK
trainval/VLe84OkwKOA/50010 WE FOUND THEM
trainval/vLEUSsEeiSU/50001 THAT'S HOW AMAZING THESE TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BECOME
trainval/vLEUSsEeiSU/50005 CALL YOUR PARENTS THAT'S WHY THEY BOUGHT THIS FOR YOU
trainval/vLEUSsEeiSU/50006 SO CAN WE USE LIGHT
trainval/vLEUSsEeiSU/50007 NOW THE CHALLENGE IS
trainval/vLEUSsEeiSU/50008 SO THAT'S A BIG CHALLENGE
trainval/vLEUSsEeiSU/50009 BUT IS THIS THE ONLY THING
trainval/vLEUSsEeiSU/50010 THAT'S THE QUESTION TO ASK
trainval/vLMKtb5bipc/50001 AND THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT IS TO WRITE ALL THE TIME
trainval/VM6HZqQKhok/50001 AND THEN I BECAME TERRIFIED TO LEARN THAT THEY'D ACTUALLY BE PUTTING ME BACK AT MY OLD HIGH SCHOOL
trainval/VM6HZqQKhok/50002 BUT I DECIDED I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
trainval/VM6HZqQKhok/50003 WHY THE HELL WOULD I WANT TO DO THAT
trainval/VM6HZqQKhok/50004 WHEN WE DON'T UNDERSTAND SOMETHING WE TEND TO BE AFRAID OF IT AND IF WE KEEP OURSELVES FROM IT THAT
trainval/vMeEKBaiPbg/50001 AND THAT'S WHERE I MET DANIEL
trainval/vMeEKBaiPbg/50002 HE HAD AN ENERGY AND A LIGHT ABOUT HIM THAT EVERYBODY WANTED TO BE AROUND
trainval/vMeEKBaiPbg/50003 HE TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO CREATE A HOMEMADE BIRTHDAY CARD FOR ME
trainval/VmP574ikRFs/50001 AND THAT HAPPENED TO US
trainval/VmP574ikRFs/50002 HE WAS BORN A BEAUTIFUL BABY BOY
trainval/VmP574ikRFs/50003 ALLERGIES TO MEDICATION
trainval/VmP574ikRFs/50004 AND BY THE TIME HE WAS A TODDLER IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HANDLE
trainval/VmP574ikRFs/50005 IT WAS THE SAME THING FOR HIM
trainval/VmP574ikRFs/50006 HE WAS WITH CHRONIC DIARRHEA
trainval/VmP574ikRFs/50007 THAT'S THE STORY
trainval/VmP574ikRFs/50008 THERE'S NOTHING GOING
trainval/VmP574ikRFs/50009 THERE'S NO BLOOD FLOW GOING THROUGH THIS PART OF THE BRAIN
trainval/VmP574ikRFs/50010 AND THERE'S NO COMMUNICATION
trainval/VmP574ikRFs/50011 THERE'S NO ACTIVITY
trainval/VmP574ikRFs/50012 AND THEY'LL GET BETTER
trainval/VmP574ikRFs/50013 AND WE ARE FIGHTING THE WRONG FIGHT
trainval/VmP574ikRFs/50014 WE ARE ADVERTISING AUTISM
trainval/VmP574ikRFs/50015 WE KNOW HOW TO KEEP THEM HEALTHY
trainval/VmP574ikRFs/50016 NOW I'LL SHARE WITH YOU WHAT WE HAD TO DO ABOUT IT
trainval/VmP574ikRFs/50017 WE NEED TO CHANGE
trainval/VmP574ikRFs/50018 WE NEED TO CHANGE THE MINDS OF THE MEDICAL INSURANCES OUT THERE
trainval/VmP574ikRFs/50019 AND WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO WITH EDDIE
trainval/VmP574ikRFs/50020 THEY DON'T HAVE A PSYCHIATRIC CONDITION
trainval/VmP574ikRFs/50021 WE WILL IN FACT
trainval/VmP574ikRFs/50022 IT'S CALLED UNIVERSITY
trainval/VmP574ikRFs/50023 AND IT WILL BE THE SAME THING FOR MANY OF OUR KIDS THAT WE ARE HELPING
trainval/VMwjscSCcf0/50001 WHY IS IT THAT THE RELATIONSHIP IN CHINA IS SO IMPORTANT
trainval/VMwjscSCcf0/50002 VALERIE I AM SORRY BUT DO YOU MIND SWAPPING CHAIRS I AM NOT COMFORTABLE SITTING IN THIS ANGLE FROM THE MAIN ENTRANCE
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50001 SO MY IDEA AROUND CHANGE AND WHAT GLOBAL LANGUAGE PROJECT IS ALL ABOUT IS TAKING
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50002 THAT'S MY PASSION
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50003 THEY ARE RESERVED FOR STUDENTS WHO HAVE PARENTS WHO CAN AFFORD AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS LANGUAGE PROGRAMS
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50004 BUT WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT IS MY GRANDPARENTS WHICH YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE THEM
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50005 MY GRANDFATHER ON MY RIGHT HAND SIDE HE GREW UP IN THE SEGREGATED SOUTH
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50006 MY GRANDMOTHER ONLY WENT TO MIDDLE SCHOOL
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50007 AND THEY RAISED ME AND THEY POURED ALL THEIR HOPES AND DREAMS
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50008 TO THEM IF I COULD JUST GET A COLLEGE EDUCATION I WOULD BE OK
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50009 LIKE THAT WAS JUST THE HOLY GRAIL
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50010 THEY BELIEVED DEEPLY THAT IF I WAS ABLE TO GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE THAT I WOULDN'T BE DESTINED TO A
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50011 GOSH THEY TOLD ME THIS ABOUT EDUCATION
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50012 BUT THAT WAS ABOUT THE HOPE THAT THEY GAVE ME
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50013 THAT'S ABOUT RAISING THE BAR
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50014 AND WHEN I STAND HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY AND I SAY THAT YOU KNOW AGAIN I GREW UP DURING A TIME WHERE I COULD BE
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50015 I COULD STILL AGAIN BREAK THAT POVERTY CYCLE
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50016 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50017 AND WHEN I LOOK AT SCHOOLS IN NEW YORK AND SOME OF THEM IN PROVIDENCE I REALIZE YOU KNOW THAT AMERICAN DREAM THAT I
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50018 THEY WON'T BE AFRAID OF IT
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50019 AND THEY WERE GOING TO GIVE A GROUP OF TEENS THE CHANCE TO GO TO COLOMBIA THE COUNTRY FOR 2
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50021 THEY HAVE TO DO A SMALL FUNDRAISER BUT IF THEY CAN'T BRING UP THE MONEY WE'LL HELP THEM GET THERE
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50022 AND I SAID YOU CAN'T GET ONE PERSON TO SIGN UP FOR THIS TRIP
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50023 WHY IS THAT
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50024 THE PARENTS DIDN'T WANT THEIR CHILDREN GOING THAT FAR
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50025 IT SEEMED SO FAR SO REMOTE
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50026 THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THEM
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50027 HOW WILL WE BE TREATED WHEN WE'RE THERE
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50028 AND THIS HAPPENS ON A REGULAR BASIS
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50029 AND WHAT THE KIDS AND THE CLASS STARTED TO BELIEVE WAS THAT THEY WERE SPECIAL
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50030 AND SOMETIMES WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES LIKE LANGUAGE OR IF YOU THINK ABOUT ARTS OR
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50031 AND IT ALSO ALLOWS THEM TO EXPLORE THEIR HORIZONS
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50032 IT IS ABOUT OPENNING THESE CHILDREN UP TO OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE KNOWN EXISTED BUT NOW THAT THEY
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50033 I FELT LIKE WE WERE ON TO SOMETHING ABOUT GIVING THEM AND EXPOSING TO CAREERS WE THOUGHT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO GIVE THEM
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50034 WHAT WE DID THIS YEAR WAS VERY INTERESTING AS WELL
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50035 IT MADE ME SMILE BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WHETHER SHE IS A HAIR STYLIST USING HER LANGUAGE OR
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50036 IF YOU DON'T KNOW IT EXISTS COULD YOU BECOME IT
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50037 BUT IT'S NOT PROBABLE
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50038 AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANTED TO DO AROUND LANGUAGES
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50039 I WAS A DAUGHTER OF A TEENAGER MOTHER WHO WAS A DAUGHTER OF A TEENAGER MOTHER
trainval/vMwPTI54rqQ/50040 HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY THINK THAT YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE CHANGE
trainval/VMXdSkW6hns/50001 GIRLS WHO WERE TOLD THEY WERE TOO SENSITIVE TOO MUCH
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50001 THEY KNOW THEIR ENVIRONMENTS INTIMATELY
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50002 AW INDIANS IN THE BRAZILIAN AMAZON FOR EXAMPLE HAVE SHOWN ME HOW THEIR UNCONTACTED RELATIVES USE THE RESIN OF THE MA
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50003 UNCONTACTED KAWAHIVA INDIANS BUILD INTRICATE LADDERS UP TREES TO COLLECT HONEY FROM BEES' NESTS AND THEY MAKE TRAPS
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50004 IT'S NOT FAR THEY TOLD ME
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50005 THEY TAKE ONLY WHAT THEY NEED FROM THEIR FOREST
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50006 THEY MOVE THEIR CROPS FROM ONE AREA TO ANOTHER TO ALLOW THE SOIL TO REPLENISH AND THEY CAREFULLY CONTROL THEIR HUNTING
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50008 WE ARE NOT WATCHING THE WORLD FROM OUTSIDE
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50009 WE ARE NOT SEPARATE FROM IT
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50010 THEIR LAND IS BEING INVADED BY LOGGERS MINERS RANCHERS OIL AND GAS PROSPECTORS
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50011 DURING THE GOLD RUSH THE RUBBER BOOM THE DECADES OF FORCED CONTACT EXPEDITIONS UP UNTIL THE LATE 1980S YET
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50012 JUST BEFORE MIDDAY DRENCHED FROM THE HEAVY RAIN WE ARRIVED AT A BEAUTIFUL PATCH OF FOREST THE FAMILY
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50013 THEY FACE CATASTROPHE IF THEIR LAND IS NOT PROTECTED
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50014 THEY FOUND THEMSELVES FORCED TO ABANDON THEIR NOMADIC LIVES FORCED TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THEIR AW NEIGHBORS
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50015 WHEN I VISITED THAT VILLAGE A FEW MONTHS LATER I WAS SHOCKED AND SADDENED TO FIND THE
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50016 I TOOK THIS PHOTO TO SHOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND TO GENERATE PRESSURE IN THEIR FAVOR
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50017 WITHIN A FEW DECADES THEY WILL BE EXTINCT
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50018 AMAZINGLY AFTER THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE PUSHED THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE URGENT HEALTH CARE THE
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50019 THIS IS THE MOMENT OF FIRST
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50020 AND SOON AFTER THEY RETURNED TO THEIR UNCONTACTED LIVES IN THEIR FOREST COVERING THEIR TRACKS AS THEY WENT SO THAT NO ONE
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50026 OR WOULD YOU RUN AND HIDE FLEEING TO PROTECT YOUR FAMILIES AND FIGHT FOR YOUR FUTURE
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50027 BECAUSE OUR CONSUMPTION OF WOODEN FURNITURE OF PETROL FOR CARS OF GOLD JEWELLERY IS
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50028 AND IN CASE THAT'S NOT ENOUGH WHAT ABOUT THE HEALTH OF OUR PLANET
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50029 WELL WE NEED TO ACT FAST
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50030 I'VE SEEN RANCHERS CALL UNCONTACTED INDIANS DIRTY AND LAZY
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50031 AND I'VE WORKED WITH INDIGENOUS LEADERS WHO RECEIVE DEATH THREATS SIMPLY FOR SPEAKING OUT FOR THEIR UNCONTACTED RELATIVES' RIGHT TO
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50032 THAT THEY'RE BACKWARD AND PRIMITIVE RELICS OF A REMOTE PAST
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50033 AND WE MUST MAKE CONTACT WITH THEM TO BRING THEM INTO THE SO CALLED MODERN WORLD
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50034 ENTERING UNCONTACTED TRIBES' LAND AND FORCING CONTACT IS FATAL
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50035 UNCONTACTED TRIBES ARE WELL AWARE OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50036 IT'S A RIGHT ENSHRINED IN NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONS
trainval/VN357QrUdEc/50037 IT'S A RIGHT ENSHRINED BY THE UNITED NATIONS
trainval/VNGFep6rncY/50001 IN OTHER WORDS WHAT IS TRUE FOR 1942 IS EVEN MORE TRUE FOR TODAY
trainval/VNGFep6rncY/50002 AND IF YOU WANT TO HAVE RESULTS THAT YOU'VE NEVER HAD BEFORE WELL YOU NEED TO START DOING THINGS YOU'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE
trainval/VNGFep6rncY/50003 HE WAS WALKING ON THE CAMPUS WITH HIS ASSISTANT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE ASSISTANT LOOKED AT ALBERT EINSTEIN AND SAID
trainval/VNGFep6rncY/50004 IT'S INTERESTING IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA APPROXIMATELY THREE PER CENT OF PEOPLE ARE INCLINED TO EVEN DO DIFFERENT THINGS
trainval/VNGFep6rncY/50006 EINSTEIN THIS EXAM WHICH YOU JUST GAVE TO THE SENIOR CLASS OF PHYSICS STUDENTS
trainval/VNGFep6rncY/50007 WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THINKING
trainval/VNGFep6rncY/50008 IF YOU HAVE TUNNEL VISION THAT'S A BIT OF A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT CONFUSES PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR OWN PERFORMANCE
trainval/VNGFep6rncY/50009 THIS IS THE REASON THAT MANY PEOPLE GO THROUGH LIFE ACTING LIKE A MEDIOCRE RACE CAR DRIVER
trainval/VNGFep6rncY/50010 EINSTEIN HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY DO THAT
trainval/VNGFep6rncY/50012 IF YOU TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT YOUR INDUSTRY OR PROFESSIONAL FIELD YOU ALSO THINK
trainval/VNGFep6rncY/50013 BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS THAT BREAKTHROUGH INNOVATION EXTRAORDINARY RESULTS HAPPEN
trainval/VNGFep6rncY/50014 FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WOULD HAVE A FURNITURE BUSINESS AND ONE DAY YOU WOULD DECIDE TO NO LONGER
trainval/VNGFep6rncY/50015 ANOTHER EXAMPLE IF YOU OWNED A COMPUTER BUSINESS AND ONE DAY YOU DECIDE TO NO LONGER SELL YOUR COMPUTER USING A PHYSICAL
trainval/VNGFep6rncY/50016 THEY SAID WELL ACTUALLY THEN WE MAKE TWO KINDS OF TAXIS
trainval/vNpmq6OkSQQ/50001 TWO BOYS HIT ME TODAY IN SCHOOL
trainval/vNpmq6OkSQQ/50002 HE BROKE THE GOOD BAD NEWS IN MY FACE
trainval/vNpmq6OkSQQ/50003 BUT THERE IS NO LAW BANNING YOU FROM DRIVING
trainval/vNpmq6OkSQQ/50004 WE ARE MINORS UNTIL THE DAY WE DIE
trainval/vNpmq6OkSQQ/50005 SO FOR ME IT WASN'T ONLY ABOUT THESE ATTACKS I HAD TO FACE
trainval/vNpmq6OkSQQ/50006 I LEARNED TO BE ALWAYS THERE
trainval/vNpmq6OkSQQ/50007 ONE OF THEM IS WHEN I WAS IN JAIL
trainval/vNpmq6OkSQQ/50008 IT'S ABOUT WOMEN THEMSELVES
trainval/vNpmq6OkSQQ/50009 A FRIEND ONCE ASKED ME SHE SAID SO WHEN DO YOU THINK THIS WOMEN DRIVING WILL HAPPEN
trainval/vNpmq6OkSQQ/50010 I TOLD HER ONLY IF WOMEN STOP ASKING WHEN
trainval/vNpmq6OkSQQ/50011 AND TAKE ACTION TO MAKE IT NOW
trainval/vNyZmSg92HI/50001 WHATEVER YOU ATTEND TO YOU FORM SOME REPRESENTATION NOT NECESSARILY COMPLETELY ACCURATE BUT SOME
trainval/vNyZmSg92HI/50002 YOU'VE GOT TOO MUCH INFORMATION IN THERE
trainval/vNyZmSg92HI/50003 AND WHEN I GOT TO OXFORD CIRCUS ON THE METRO I GOT OFF THE TRAIN TO GO TO MY
trainval/VnzBGZA2z3w/50001 SO IT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE DELIGHTS OF MY ENTIRE CAREER
trainval/VnzBGZA2z3w/50002 YOU HAVE TO FIRE THIS GUY
trainval/VnzBGZA2z3w/50003 WHEN I WAS A CHILD OR WHEN I GET OLD
trainval/vo2cse4CoGM/50001 WE WERE JUST A LOT MORE NAIVE
trainval/vo2cse4CoGM/50002 I JUST THINK THAT MY GENERATION'S LACK OF EXPERIENCE IN MANAGING OUR REPUTATIONS
trainval/vo2cse4CoGM/50003 BUT MY VERY CANDID SUITEMATE IN THAT MOMENT SAID SOMETHING THAT WAS GUARANTEED TO PLEASE NO ONE AND I'M
trainval/vo2cse4CoGM/50004 YOU SEE SINCE THEN I'VE EXPERIENCED OVER AND OVER HOW PEOPLE FEEL THAT A
trainval/vo2cse4CoGM/50005 AND I THINK THAT WE'RE HAVING A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT COLLEGE EXPERIENCE BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF
trainval/vo2cse4CoGM/50006 WE PROCESS DISAGREEMENT AS AN ATTACK AND GO INTO DEFENSE MODE
trainval/vo2cse4CoGM/50007 WE GO INTO OUR REPTILE BRAINS AND WE JUST STOP THINKING
trainval/vo2cse4CoGM/50008 AND THAT'S WHY I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE THE ROLE THE PROMOTER OF FAITH PLAYED IN THE
trainval/vo2cse4CoGM/50009 AND EVENTUALLY THE CHURCH CAME TO RECOGNIZE SAINTS AS MORE THAN JUST PEOPLE WORTHY OF
trainval/vo2cse4CoGM/50010 SO EVENTUALLY THE ROLE OF THE PROSECUTOR WAS DEVELOPED
trainval/vo2cse4CoGM/50011 YOUR PEERS ARE ALWAYS ONLINE WATCHING AND RESPONDING
trainval/vo2cse4CoGM/50012 SO I THINK IN THAT SENSE YOUR EXPERIENCE HAS PERHAPS BETTER PREPARED YOU TO BE
trainval/vo2cse4CoGM/50013 BUT IN THE MODERN ERA YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE A LOT OF EYEWITNESSES
trainval/vo2cse4CoGM/50014 WELL IN MY OPINION I THINK YOU NEED ADVOCACY IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY
trainval/vo2cse4CoGM/50015 NOW THE PEOPLE WHO WERE CLAMORING FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL TO BE PROCLAIMED A SAINT
trainval/vo2cse4CoGM/50016 WE ARE JUDGING PEOPLE EVERY SECOND OF THE DAY
trainval/vo2cse4CoGM/50017 STUDIES SHOW THAT WE FORM AN OPINION ABOUT PEOPLE WITHIN THE FIRST SEVEN SECONDS THAT WE ENCOUNTER THEM
trainval/vo2cse4CoGM/50018 HOW DO YOU GAIN THE FREEDOM TO SPEAK SOMETHING WITHOUT FEAR THAT SOMEONE'S GOING TO IMMEDIATELY REJECT IT OR REJECT
trainval/vo2cse4CoGM/50019 NOW THE POSTULATOR'S PRIMARY ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY WAS TO SEEK OUT ALL EVIDENCE IN FAVOR OF
trainval/vo2cse4CoGM/50020 CHANGE CAN ONLY HAPPEN WHEN SOMEONE IS WILLING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AND CAN BE HEARD
trainval/vo2cse4CoGM/50021 BY THE 1960S THE CHURCH NEEDED TO MODERNIZE AND POPE JOHN XXIII CONVENED
trainval/VObLitSe3K0/50001 AND IN THE FIRST PLACE THE FIRST THING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT SOIL IS NOT DIRT
trainval/VObLitSe3K0/50002 SO THE WAY WES HAS PUT THIS IS THAT WE ARE SIMPLY STOPOVERS BETWEEN SOIL AND SOIL
trainval/VObLitSe3K0/50003 AND THEN WHEN YOU GO BACK TO PLANTING FOOD CROP AGAIN YOU INCORPORATE THAT INTO THE SOIL AND PUT
trainval/VObLitSe3K0/50004 5 ON HIS FARM
trainval/VoCOzuWOgSY/50001 BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAD SOME CRITICAL MASS BUT AS WE TAKE THAT FORWARD WHY IS THAT EVEN IMPORTANT WHY IS THAT RELEVANT
trainval/VoCOzuWOgSY/50002 AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS SILICON VALLEY AT LEAST IN MY CONTEXT
trainval/VoCOzuWOgSY/50003 AND I THINK SOME OF THE ELEMENTS WE'LL TALK ABOUT BUT I THINK THAT ONE IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE IS THAT IT
trainval/VoCOzuWOgSY/50004 WHEN I LOOK FORWARD 20 YEARS
trainval/VoCOzuWOgSY/50005 ANT THAT'S THE CONCEPT I HAVE IN MY MIND
trainval/VoCOzuWOgSY/50006 SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT YEAH IT STARTED WITH MARKETING BUT IT BECAME A REALITY
trainval/VoCOzuWOgSY/50007 I'LL GIVE YOU THREE EXAMPLES OF WHAT THAT MEANS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE
trainval/VoCOzuWOgSY/50008 PATENTS ARE AROUND THE LEGAL PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
trainval/VoCOzuWOgSY/50009 I THINK BY ANY MEASURE IT ABSOLUTELY IS
trainval/VoCOzuWOgSY/50010 TALENT LIKES TO BE THERE
trainval/VoCOzuWOgSY/50011 SO FOR EVERY SUPER SPECTACULAR SUCCESS THERE'S 2 OR 3 COMPANIES THAT ACTUALLY FAIL
trainval/VoCOzuWOgSY/50012 AND IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE I THINK IT'S HUMAN NATURE
trainval/VoCOzuWOgSY/50013 AND SO AS THE WATER CYCLES DEPICTED IN THIS SLIDE LARGELY SPEAKING THE WATER EVAPORATES IT GOES INTO THE
trainval/VoCOzuWOgSY/50014 IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE THAT WANT TO GROW THEIR COMPANIES
trainval/VoCOzuWOgSY/50016 I THINK WE'RE THERE
trainval/VoCOzuWOgSY/50017 IF WE COULD BREAK SOME INTERNATIONAL RANKINGS THAT WOULD BE GREAT AS WELL BUT WE CAN WORK STEP BY STEP
trainval/VoCOzuWOgSY/50018 I WORK FOR A MULTINATIONAL COMPANY
trainval/VoCOzuWOgSY/50019 YOU CAN'T HAVE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER
trainval/VoCOzuWOgSY/50020 WE HAD NO MONEY IT WAS JUST AN IDEA
trainval/VoCOzuWOgSY/50021 AND IN FACT IT WAS LARGELY FREE
trainval/VoCOzuWOgSY/50022 THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT
trainval/VoCOzuWOgSY/50023 BUILD A COMMUNITY
trainval/VoCOzuWOgSY/50024 AND REMEMBER THAT THE COMPETITION IS NOT WARSAW OR WROCLAW AS A PREVIOUS SPEAKER SAID
trainval/VoCOzuWOgSY/50025 AND I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH A QUOTE
trainval/VohNDqzWP9E/50001 AND SO I ALREADY KNOW WHAT YOU ARE THINKING
trainval/VohNDqzWP9E/50002 IN TALKING WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS I BECAME INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED BY HOW WE AS THIS SUPPORT NETWORK
trainval/VohNDqzWP9E/50003 OH I LOVE YOU
trainval/VohNDqzWP9E/50004 BUT AGAIN THEY'RE GROSSLY INEFFICIENT BECAUSE THEY CHANGE THE CHEMISTRY OF THE BRAIN AS A WHOLE AS OPPOSED TO THOSE SPECIFIC
trainval/VohNDqzWP9E/50005 AND DAD I LOVE YOU
trainval/voLcX6SpF9g/50001 HONESTLY I COULDN'T REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID BUT ONE OF THE WORDS HE MENTIONED GRABBED MY ATTENTION AND THAT WORD WAS
trainval/voLcX6SpF9g/50002 WHICH CLASS DID I BELONG TO THEN
trainval/VOXikTyZxPA/50001 BUT THERE IS MORE TO IT
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50001 THERE IS A BETTER WAY
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50002 HAVE YOU NOTICED
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50003 IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50004 WHAT CAN WE DO WITH THIS
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50005 I'M SCARED OF MATH
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50006 WHAT HAPPENS IF I HAVE A REALLY TURBULENT FLIGHT
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50007 THAT JUST MEANS THANKS FOR THE HEADS UP
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50008 WE JUST HAVE A DIFFERENT CONTEXT WHAT WILL THE FUTURE BE FOR THESE PEOPLE
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50009 I NEED A GOOD PUSH AND IS THE BEST THAT COULD'VE HAPPENED TO ME
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50011 PEOPLE LIST WHAT ARE THINGS WE COULD BEFORE THE CHANGE THAT WE COULD STILL DO
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50012 YOU GO YEAH YEAH YEAH
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50013 THIS IS JUST NEW LOOK VAM
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50014 IT'S HARD TO PICK THE DIFFERENCE
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50015 I THINK PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY FOR ACTUAL ACHIEVEMENT
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50016 DOES THAT MAKE SENSE
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50017 THIS IS JUST PHONY PHONY CHANGE
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50018 YOU DIDN'T FOOL ME
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50019 PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY'RE NOT BEING CONSULTED
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50020 WHAT WORKS IS AUTHORSHIP
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50021 IF YOU SAY HERE'S WHY WE HAVE TO CHANGE
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50022 HERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT HAVE TO CHANGE
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50023 IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT HAVE YOU EVER RENOVATED A HOUSE
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50024 WHAT DID YOU KEEP
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50025 WHAT DID YOU CHUCK
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50026 WHAT DID YOU CHANGE
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50027 WHAT DID YOU ADD
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50028 WHAT WOULD YOU DO
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50030 CAN YOU SEE THE POWER IN THIS
trainval/vPhM8lxibSU/50031 THEY'RE SICK OF BELIEVING SOMETHING THAT ISN'T REAL
trainval/vPn94XAUBoo/50001 MY COLLEAGUES AND I IN CURA AO ARE INTERESTED IN LOOKING FORWARD AT WHAT MIGHT BE
trainval/vPn94XAUBoo/50002 WHATEVER THE CAUSE WE HAVE MUCH MORE WORK TO DO BEFORE WE CAN USE BABY CORALS
trainval/vpTHi7O66pI/50001 HOW WERE WE TO DO IT
trainval/VpvzrtPtqeE/50001 AND THE SAME APPLIES TO SOCIETY
trainval/VpvzrtPtqeE/50002 WE'RE IN A SENSE A SUPERORGANISM
trainval/VPweEhht9y4/50001 WILLIAM ANDERS WAS THE FIRST TO WITNESS THE EVENT
trainval/VPweEhht9y4/50002 I'M AFRAID HOPE IS NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH
trainval/VPweEhht9y4/50003 IT DID NOT TAKE US LONG TO REALIZE THAT OUR JOURNEY HAD JUST AS MUCH TO DO WITH CONCERNS OVER THE
trainval/VPweEhht9y4/50004 PERHAPS YOUR DOMESTIC DOG FOR A WHILE BEFORE HOPEFULLY BECOMING FERAL
trainval/VPweEhht9y4/50005 DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT YOUR CAT
trainval/VPweEhht9y4/50006 NOW I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I FEEL SAD ABOUT THIS RATHER TRAGIC DIAGNOSIS OR SHOULD
trainval/VPxEde3Q1F0/50001 GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE MY NAME IS ZAHER BARAKY I'M HERE STUDYING MY EXECUTIVE MBA AT ECOLE H TELI RE
trainval/VPxEde3Q1F0/50002 PEOPLE COMING FROM THE SAME LOCAL COMMUNITY FROM THE SAME BACKGROUND FROM THE SAME STRUGGLES
trainval/vQILP19qABk/50001 THEY ARE BEING WATCHED BY ROY PRICE AND HIS TEAM WHO RECORD EVERYTHING
trainval/vQILP19qABk/50002 AND ALL OF THAT GOES BACK TO A DECISION THAT ROY HAD TO MAKE ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO
trainval/vQILP19qABk/50003 THEY RECORD WHEN SOMEBODY PRESSES PLAY WHEN SOMEBODY PRESSES PAUSE WHAT PARTS THEY SKIP WHAT PARTS THEY WATCH AGAIN
trainval/vQILP19qABk/50004 SO YOU SEE ROY PRICE IS A SENIOR EXECUTIVE WITH AMAZON STUDIOS
trainval/vQILP19qABk/50005 THAT'S THE TV PRODUCTION COMPANY OF AMAZON
trainval/vQILP19qABk/50006 AND THAT'S NOT BECAUSE A COMPANY LIKE MULTI HEALTH SYSTEMS DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH DATA
trainval/vQILP19qABk/50007 EVEN THE MOST DATA SAVVY COMPANIES GET IT WRONG
trainval/vQILP19qABk/50008 THERE'S ANOTHER TOOL THAT CAN DO THAT AND WE ALL HAVE IT AND THAT TOOL IS THE BRAIN
trainval/vQILP19qABk/50009 TED SARANDOS AND HIS TEAM MADE THAT DECISION TO LICENSE THAT SHOW WHICH ALSO MEANT BY THE WAY THAT THEY
trainval/vQILP19qABk/50010 THEY USED DATA ALL THE WAY TO DRIVE THEIR DECISION MAKING FIRST WHEN THEY HELD THEIR COMPETITION OF TV IDEAS THEN
trainval/Vqm8fXFFHyY/50001 IT'S SOMETHING CALLED INSIGHT ORIENTED THERAPY AND I THINK THAT IN MANY WAYS IT'S GOTTEN A BAD RAP IN
trainval/Vqm8fXFFHyY/50002 97 FOR OVERALL PSYCHIATRIC IMPROVEMENT AND 1
trainval/Vqm8fXFFHyY/50003 AN EFFECT SIZE OF
trainval/Vqm8fXFFHyY/50004 BECAUSE THESE NUMBERS
trainval/Vqm8fXFFHyY/50005 97 FOR OVERALL IMPROVEMENT AND 1
trainval/Vqm8fXFFHyY/50006 PART OF WHAT THAT ALSO MEANS IS THAT PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM THERAPY EVEN AFTER THEY STOP GOING
trainval/Vqm8fXFFHyY/50007 SO CLEARLY I GOT A LOT OUT OF IT
trainval/Vqm8fXFFHyY/50008 I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THAT LADY WAS GOING TO DO TO ME
trainval/Vqm8fXFFHyY/50009 I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY ROOM FOR JUDGMENT IN THERAPY AND I KNOW THAT'S A SENTIMENT I SHARE WITH MANY OF MY
trainval/Vqm8fXFFHyY/50010 IF EVERY TIME YOU GOT BEHIND THE WHEEL OF A CAR YOU HAD TO LEARN TO DRIVE ALL OVER AGAIN IT WOULD BE HARD TO GET
trainval/Vqm8fXFFHyY/50011 THE TRICKY PART IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE APPLY THIS THEORY OF LEARNING TO OUR EMOTIONAL LIVES OR TO HUMAN
trainval/Vqm8fXFFHyY/50012 IF WE HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING A PARTNER OR IF WE FEEL INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATED WITH THE ONE WE'VE GOT
trainval/Vqm8fXFFHyY/50013 WHAT A TRAINED THERAPIST DOES AMONG OTHER THINGS IS HELP US TO EXPLORE THE ROLE THAT WE ARE PLAYING IN OUR OWN
trainval/Vqm8fXFFHyY/50014 THE BEAUTY OF THIS KIND OF THERAPY IS THAT IT CARRIES WITH IT A DEEP RESPECT FOR THE
trainval/vqPAdUeU6mQ/50001 A MAN WALKS DOWN A ROAD
trainval/vqPAdUeU6mQ/50002 I WAS IMMEDIATELY GRIPPED BY THE MAGICAL AND FAIRY TALE QUALITIES OF THE SUBJECT
trainval/vqPAdUeU6mQ/50003 WHERE DOES THE PERSISTENCE COME FROM
trainval/vqqWw3xkMzA/50001 AND SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
trainval/VQRjouwKDlU/50001 YOU HAD TO GO TO CLASS
trainval/vqz49SrYRMk/50001 BUT THEY REMINDED ME THAT THE POWER TO SURVIVE AND IN FACT THE POWER TO THRIVE MENTALLY IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT
trainval/vR8msiSohZM/50001 OLD BUILDINGS STORING RICH MEMORIES ARE BEING DESTROYED
trainval/vR8msiSohZM/50002 FORTUNATELY IT'S NOT THAT WAY EVERYWHERE IN JAPAN
trainval/vR8msiSohZM/50003 I THINK MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT
trainval/vR8msiSohZM/50004 TO REMINISCE AND TO IMAGINE THEMSELVES BACK IN TIME
trainval/vR8msiSohZM/50005 THOUGH THESE IMAGES LOOK HISTORICAL THEY ARE ACTUALLY CONTEMPORARY
trainval/vR8msiSohZM/50006 HISTORY IS NOT MERELY THE PAST
trainval/vR8msiSohZM/50007 THAT'S WHAT A GOOD CONCERT STILL DOES TODAY
trainval/vR8msiSohZM/50008 WE CAN FIND EXAMPLES OF THIS IN ALMOST EVERY ASPECT OF JAPANESE CULTURE
trainval/vR8msiSohZM/50009 THE EXPOSURES ARE LONG
trainval/vR8msiSohZM/50010 WE MUST IMAGINE OR LEARN WHERE WE ARE GOING AND MEANWHILE WE MUST BE FULLY
trainval/vR8msiSohZM/50011 I HOPE I'VE HELPED YOU TO APPRECIATE THAT
trainval/VRhjc3dJtOo/50002 LET US MAKE OURSELVES INTO VESSELS UNBREAKABLE SO THAT WE
trainval/vRK7KKQH9Ck/50001 IN FACT ALL RACES AND ALL NATIONS ARE SUSCEPTIBLE
trainval/vRK7KKQH9Ck/50002 THE HUMAN CONSEQUENCES COULD BE DEVASTATING
trainval/vRK7KKQH9Ck/50003 PEOPLE STOP GOING TO WORK
trainval/vRK7KKQH9Ck/50004 REMEMBER IT TOOK THREE MONTHS TO DIAGNOSE EBOLA
trainval/vRK7KKQH9Ck/50005 WOULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE IF WE COULD HAVE DETECTED EBOLA THREE MONTHS EARLIER WHEN IT FIRST
trainval/vRK7KKQH9Ck/50006 IT'S LOCATED IN DURBAN IN SOUTH AFRICA
trainval/vRK7KKQH9Ck/50007 IT'S ONE OF THE POOREST PARTS OF SOUTH AFRICA AND IT'S ALSO THE EPICENTER OF THE HIV PANDEMIC
trainval/vrU6YJle6Q4/50001 THEY'RE LIKE WE KNOW
trainval/vrU6YJle6Q4/50002 I HAD MISSED THE POINT
trainval/VS5CCbyap5Q/50001 SOMETIMES EVEN BEING MADE REDUNDANT
trainval/VS5CCbyap5Q/50002 WE DON'T REALLY NEED MUCH FROM ANYONE
trainval/VS5CCbyap5Q/50003 SO WE ENGAGE LESS
trainval/VS5CCbyap5Q/50004 AND OF COURSE THE DYING OF COMMUNITY IN AN AGE WHERE DIRECT COMMUNICATION HAS BEEN
trainval/VS5CCbyap5Q/50005 THEY WERE QUITTING JOBS THEY DIDN'T LIKE
trainval/VS5CCbyap5Q/50006 IF YOU WANTED A FIRST AIDER OR AN EXPERT IN FIRE EXTINGUISHERS THERE WAS STEVE OR ANDY
trainval/vSjlCJaEwZE/50002 PRESUMABLY IT JUST LAYS SO FAR OUTSIDE THE REALM OF THIS GUY'S IMAGINATION THAT A SOLDIER IN THE BRITISH
trainval/vSjlCJaEwZE/50004 EMBOLDENED BY THIS HE HATCHED WHAT PROBABLY REMAINS I THINK ONE OF THE BALLSIEST CRIMINAL
trainval/vSjlCJaEwZE/50005 HE MARCHED THE SOLDIERS DOWN TO THE LOCAL RAILWAY STATION AND THEY TRAVELED ALL THE WAY TO K PENICK WHICH IS A TOWN
trainval/vSjlCJaEwZE/50006 WHAT HE'D DONE IS EVENTUALLY CONFISCATED 4000 MARKS AS PART OF THE TRIAL AS EVIDENCE IN THE TRIAL AND THEN
trainval/vSjlCJaEwZE/50007 SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY YES AND SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY NO
trainval/vSjlCJaEwZE/50008 AND IN SOME WAYS THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY SURPRISING
trainval/vSjlCJaEwZE/50010 SO IT DEEPENS THE ANXIETY
trainval/vSjlCJaEwZE/50011 ALL OF US STRIVE TO DISGUISE OUR FLAWS IN THE EYES OF OTHER PEOPLE
trainval/vSjlCJaEwZE/50012 WE DO LIVE IN A WORLD WHICH IS OVERLY IMPRESSED BY SUPERFICIAL CHARACTERISTICS LIKE YOUR TITLE OR YOUR
trainval/VSJpBJal3F8/50001 IS THIS A TIME TO FIGHT FLIGHT OR FLEE
trainval/VSJpBJal3F8/50003 LIKE A DOZEN
trainval/VSJpBJal3F8/50004 HE JUST LOOKED AT ME DAD YOU JUST DON'T GET IT
trainval/VSJpBJal3F8/50005 HE HAS SO MANY POTENTIAL ANSWERS
trainval/VSJpBJal3F8/50006 HE'S PROCESSING SO MANY DIFFERENT POSSIBLE VARIATIONS
trainval/VSJpBJal3F8/50007 WHEN HE'S ASKED WHY CAN'T YOU JUST GIVE A RESPONSE WHY CAN'T YOU JUST
trainval/VSJpBJal3F8/50008 MY CLASSROOM WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PILOT FOR THE FRIENDS FOR LIFE PROGRAM
trainval/VSJpBJal3F8/50009 BUT STILL I'LL GET DISTRACTED I'LL THINK WHAT ELSE MIGHT IT BE
trainval/VSJpBJal3F8/50010 WHAT CAN IT BE
trainval/VSJpBJal3F8/50011 WE HAVE TO TAKE IT FOR WHAT IT IS
trainval/VSJpBJal3F8/50012 HERE ARE MY RULES WHEN WORKING WITH GENERALIZED ANXIETY AND ANY SORT OF MENTAL ILLNESS
trainval/VSJpBJal3F8/50013 IT WON'T BE EASY BUT GET THEM IN THE SCHOOL
trainval/VSJpBJal3F8/50014 NOT EVEN THE CLASSROOM WE CAN WORRY ABOUT THE CLASSROOM LATER
trainval/VSJpBJal3F8/50015 WE NEED TO GET RID OF THAT GAME
trainval/vSONFixSe4k/50001 AND THE FACT THAT IT'S SOLID AT ROOM TEMPERATURE IS A SIGN THAT BACON GREASE IS LOADED WITH
trainval/vSONFixSe4k/50002 AND THIS IS MY MOST IMPORTANT POINT
trainval/vSONFixSe4k/50003 I LEFT MY FRYING PAN ON THE PICNIC TABLE AND IT RAINED LAST WEEK
trainval/vSONFixSe4k/50004 OR COPPER PIPES
trainval/vSONFixSe4k/50005 WHO HAS COPPER PIPES
trainval/vSONFixSe4k/50006 AND WE USED TO THINK ISN'T THAT GREAT
trainval/vSONFixSe4k/50007 UNTIL WE REALIZED IRON IS A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD
trainval/vSONFixSe4k/50008 SO YOU WANT TO GET IT FROM FOOD THAT'S THE FORM THAT NATURE HAS DESIGNED FOR US AND THAT'S THE FORM THAT WE'VE EVOLVED WITH
trainval/vSONFixSe4k/50009 IF YOU HAVE THOSE DICED SALTY ALMONDS AND YOU'VE EATEN THEM
trainval/vSONFixSe4k/50010 THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT SALTY CASHEWS AND ALMONDS IS IT JUST ME
trainval/vSONFixSe4k/50011 AND IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN I NEED A FIRE EXTINGUISHER
trainval/vSONFixSe4k/50012 THAT PURPLE COLOR THOSE ANTHOCYANINS HAPPEN TO BE POWERFUL ANTIOXIDANTS
trainval/vSONFixSe4k/50013 SO BACK INTO THE LABORATORY
trainval/vSONFixSe4k/50014 AND ALSO WHO EATS OFF A PYRAMID ANYWAY
trainval/vSONFixSe4k/50015 IT DECIDES WHAT SHOULD BE LET THROUGH INTO MEMORY AND WHAT SHOULD NOT BE LET THROUGH
trainval/VStEmE85QDE/50001 SOME ASPECTS OF THIS FAILURE ARE INADVERTENT AND INNOCENT LIKE HOW SOME SCIENTISTS COMMUNICATE
trainval/VStEmE85QDE/50002 WHEN I FIRST STARTED WORKING WITH CLIMATE SCIENTISTS I REALIZED THAT PEOPLE HAD A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING SOME OF THEM
trainval/VStEmE85QDE/50003 ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING NOW
trainval/VStEmE85QDE/50004 THE MEDIA MAY NOT TELL US WHAT TO THINK BUT THEY TELL US WHAT TO THINK ABOUT AND IT'S NOT GLOBAL WARMING
trainval/VStEmE85QDE/50005 SO WHAT CAN WE DO
trainval/VStEmE85QDE/50006 WE NEED TO CREATE A CONVERSATION AROUND THESE SHARED VALUES AND AROUND HOW CLIMATE CHANGE IS AFFECTING ALL
trainval/VStEmE85QDE/50007 THE SOLUTIONS TO CLIMATE CHANGE ARE HERE AND AVAILABLE TO US NOW AND THEY OFFER SUCH A
trainval/VSUWNySSpLI/50002 REMIND THEM THAT THE YEAR HAS PASSED TO BE DOCILE OR SMALL
trainval/VSUWNySSpLI/50003 SOME OF US SAID FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT WE WERE WOMEN TOOK THIS OATH OF SOLIDARITY SERIOUSLY
trainval/VSUWNySSpLI/50004 SOME OF US BORE CHILDREN AND SOME OF US DID NOT AND NONE OF US QUESTIONED WHETHER THAT MADE US REAL OR APPROPRIATE OR
trainval/VSUWNySSpLI/50005 WERE YOU FEARFUL OR FEARSOME
trainval/VSUWNySSpLI/50006 WHAT COLORED THE WALLS OF YOUR REGRET
trainval/VSUWNySSpLI/50007 WHAT DID YOU DO FOR WOMEN IN THE YEAR IT WAS TIME
trainval/VSUWNySSpLI/50008 AND ARE YOU A HERO
trainval/VSUWNySSpLI/50009 SHE WILL NOT CARE ABOUT THE ARC OF YOUR BROW THE WEIGHT OF YOUR CLUTCH
trainval/VSUWNySSpLI/50010 SHE WILL NOT ASK OF YOUR MENTIONS
trainval/VSUWNySSpLI/50011 THERE WERE STILL LAWS FOR EVERY WAY WE USED OUR PRIVATES WHILE THEY PAWED AT THE SOFT FOLDS OF US GRABBED
trainval/VSUWNySSpLI/50012 SAY DAUGHTER I STOOD THERE WITH THE MOMENT DRAWN ON MY FACE LIKE A DAGGER AND FLUNG IT BACK AT ITSELF SLICING
trainval/VSUWNySSpLI/50013 TELL HER THE TRUTH HOW YOU LIVED IN SPITE OF CROOKED ODDS
trainval/VSUWNySSpLI/50014 TELL HER YOU WERE BRAVE AND ALWAYS ALWAYS IN THE COMPANY OF COURAGE MOSTLY THE DAYS WHEN YOU JUST HAD YOURSELF
trainval/VSUWNySSpLI/50015 TELL HER SHE WAS BORN AS YOU WERE AS YOUR MOTHERS BEFORE AND THE SISTERS BESIDE THEM IN THE AGE OF
trainval/VSUWNySSpLI/50016 WE WERE TRAINED TO DODGE TO WAIT TO COWER AND COVER TO WAIT
trainval/VSUWNySSpLI/50017 WE WERE TOLD TO BE SILENT
trainval/VT3XyORCFDA/50001 IT'S NOT SOMETHING I WAS VERY HAPPY ABOUT
trainval/VT3XyORCFDA/50002 AND I HAVE THESE PALPITATIONS THAT ARE SHOWING UP
trainval/VT3XyORCFDA/50003 I HOPE YOU WILL GO OUT AND MAKE PERSONAL HEALTH HAPPEN FOR YOURSELVES AND FOR EVERYONE
trainval/vu7eInSBt4I/50001 IT'S A CROSS CULTURAL EXCHANGE
trainval/vu7eInSBt4I/50002 FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF DURBAN
trainval/vu7eInSBt4I/50003 WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH MY HAIR
trainval/vu7eInSBt4I/50004 MY HAIR IS IMPORTANT TO ME
trainval/vu7eInSBt4I/50005 IT'S WRAPPED UP IN MY CULTURAL HERITAGE
trainval/vu7eInSBt4I/50006 SEE I KEEP MY HAIR NATURAL SO IT'S NOT TO DEVIATE TOO FAR FROM THE MASTERWORK THE CREATOR HAS GIVEN
trainval/vu7eInSBt4I/50007 I THOUGHT TO MYSELF
trainval/vu7eInSBt4I/50008 MAYBE THAT'S WHY
trainval/vu7eInSBt4I/50009 I'LL FIND IT I'LL FIND IT
trainval/vu7eInSBt4I/50010 I LIKE THEM ALREADY
trainval/vu7eInSBt4I/50011 HE HAD BEEN CONSCRIPTED INTO MY GROUP HE REALLY WANTED TO BE IN
trainval/vu7eInSBt4I/50012 ONE DAY WE GO TO ANOTHER MALL
trainval/vUQLN4o63SY/50001 THAT MUST BE NECROPHILIA
trainval/vUQLN4o63SY/50002 SO AFTER SIX YEARS MY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES URGED ME TO PUBLISH SO I PUBLISHED THE FIRST CASE OF HOMOSEXUAL
trainval/vUQLN4o63SY/50003 HE CALLED ME FROM CAMBRIDGE MASSACHUSETTS
trainval/VUT6GQveD0E/50001 BEGINNING MIDDLE AND END
trainval/VUT6GQveD0E/50002 BUT I NEVER FOUND THAT REALLY SUPER INSIGHTFUL
trainval/VUT6GQveD0E/50003 THEY HAVE FIVE
trainval/vvEH93EQiKg/50001 I JUST FEEL LOCKED IN FEAR
trainval/vvhiNSqq6oo/50001 YET THESE MEN REMAIN DEAD
trainval/vvhiNSqq6oo/50002 AND ARE MONITORING THEIR PROGRESS TO SEE IF IT WILL EFFECTIVELY KILL THEM
trainval/vvhiNSqq6oo/50003 AND I WAS THEREFORE ABLE TO PHOTOGRAPH THE FULLY ASSEMBLED REMAINS
trainval/vvhiNSqq6oo/50004 SO THEY'RE TESTING ITS VIRULENCE
trainval/vvhiNSqq6oo/50005 IT'S COMMONLY REPORTED IN UKRAINE THAT CHILDREN WHEN LEAVING THE ORPHANAGE ARE TARGETED FOR HUMAN
trainval/vvlozhvQPJw/50001 I REMEMBERED YOUR SHELTER WAS A SUCH A SAFE WARM PLACE TO STAY SHE SAID SO I THOUGHT OF YOU WHEN MY
trainval/vvlozhvQPJw/50002 THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY JOBS IN OUR ECONOMY THAT JUST DON'T PAY A LIVING WAGE
trainval/vvlozhvQPJw/50003 IF WE CONTINUE ON THIS TRAJECTORY I'M CONFIDENT WE'LL MAKE A LASTING CHANGE WITH AND FOR THIS
trainval/vvlozhvQPJw/50004 LET'S STOP BLAMING JACKIE FOR BEING BORN POOR FOR GROWING UP POOR AND ENDING UP POOR AS THOUGH IT'S SOMEHOW
trainval/VvpUZjRVoBI/50001 AND HE DISPLACED US FROM THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE TO JUST BE ONE OF MANY IN THE UNIVERSE SO WE COULD SEE HIM
trainval/VvpUZjRVoBI/50002 BRUNO SAID WAIT A MINUTE
trainval/VvpUZjRVoBI/50003 WHY ARE WE SO FASCINATED BY EVERYTHING THAT WE FIND IN THE NIGHT SKY
trainval/VvpUZjRVoBI/50004 WE'RE ONE OF MANY PLANETS IN THIS SOLAR SYSTEM
trainval/VvpUZjRVoBI/50005 OUR SYSTEM IS ONE OF MANY SYSTEMS IN THIS GALAXY
trainval/VvpUZjRVoBI/50006 THE CREATION OF HIGHER ELEMENTS HAPPENS WHERE CARBON IS MADE WHERE NITROGEN IS MADE
trainval/VvpUZjRVoBI/50007 WHERE THE CALCIUM THAT'S IN YOUR BONES IS MADE
trainval/VvpUZjRVoBI/50008 THEY SEE AMINO ACIDS IN STELLAR NEBULA WHERE NEW STARS ARE BEING BORN
trainval/VvpUZjRVoBI/50009 WHERE NEW STAR SYSTEMS ARE BEING BORN
trainval/VvpUZjRVoBI/50010 WHAT IS IT ABOUT SPACE
trainval/VvpUZjRVoBI/50011 THERE'S A LOT ABOUT SPACE THAT KEEPS US INTERESTED
trainval/VvpUZjRVoBI/50012 SPACE IS ABOUT YOU AND ME AND WHERE WE CAME FROM
trainval/VvpUZjRVoBI/50013 MAYBE 5 YEARS MAYBE 10 MAYBE 20 MAYBE 50 BUT OF THESE THOUSANDS OF PLANETS THAT WE'RE DISCOVERING
trainval/VvpUZjRVoBI/50014 THE VIDEO BEGINS AND ENDS WITH THIS MAN
trainval/VvpUZjRVoBI/50015 WHO PAID FOR THIS
trainval/VvpUZjRVoBI/50016 WHY DID RED BULL PAY FOR THIS
trainval/VvpUZjRVoBI/50017 AND YOU DID
trainval/VvpUZjRVoBI/50018 LAUGHING PAY FOR A TICKET TO GO INTO SPACE WITH THIS GUY
trainval/VvpUZjRVoBI/50019 WITH HIS COMPANY
trainval/VvpUZjRVoBI/50020 I THINK THAT'S WHY PEOPLE WANT TO BE A PART OF SPACE
trainval/VvpUZjRVoBI/50021 AND I THINK THAT THAT'S AN IDEA WORTH SHARING
trainval/vVsXO9brK7M/50001 THAT FORMULATION FORCES YOU TO BE OUTWARD FACING
trainval/vVsXO9brK7M/50002 SO SINCE YOU ALL DID SO WELL WE HAVE TIME FOR JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA CREDIT
trainval/vVsXO9brK7M/50003 YOU'RE GOING TO KNOW YOUR LIFE PURPOSE NOW IN THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES
trainval/vVsXO9brK7M/50004 LOOK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THE UNEXAMINED LIFE IS NOT WORTH LIVING BUT IF ALL YOU'RE
trainval/vVsXO9brK7M/50005 ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE
trainval/vVsXO9brK7M/50006 THAT WAS THE FIRST ONE ONLY FOUR TO GO
trainval/vVsXO9brK7M/50007 WHAT DO YOU LOVE TO DO
trainval/vVsXO9brK7M/50008 DON'T RELEASE IT YET
trainval/vVsXO9brK7M/50009 ON THE COUNT OF FIVE
trainval/vVsXO9brK7M/50010 THAT'S WHAT YOU DO
trainval/vVsXO9brK7M/50011 WHO DO YOU DO IT FOR
trainval/vVsXO9brK7M/50012 WHAT DO ALL THOSE PEOPLE WANT OR NEED
trainval/vVsXO9brK7M/50013 WHAT DO THEY WANT OR NEED
trainval/vVsXO9brK7M/50014 IN JUST ONE OR TWO WORDS
trainval/vVsXO9brK7M/50015 HOLD IT DON'T RELEASE IT YET
trainval/vVsXO9brK7M/50017 NOW THIS IS THE BEST ONE
trainval/vVsXO9brK7M/50018 HOW DO THEY CHANGE
trainval/vVsXO9brK7M/50019 ON THE COUNT OF FIVE HOW DO THEY CHANGE OR TRANSFORM AS A RESULT OF WHAT YOU GIVE THEM
trainval/vVsXO9brK7M/50020 NOW WE'RE GOING TO PUT THIS ALL TOGETHER KIND OF IN A SENTENCE OK
trainval/vVsXO9brK7M/50021 SO WHEN PEOPLE ASK YOU THIS QUESTION SO WHAT DO YOU DO
trainval/vVsXO9brK7M/50023 IT'S THAT TRANSACTIONAL THING WHERE IT'S LIKE
trainval/vVY8L56oxSM/50001 BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE'RE RESTORING HOMES THE SYSTEM IS NOT ABOUT EMPOWERING PEOPLE
trainval/vVY8L56oxSM/50002 AND PEOPLE START SHARING STORIES
trainval/vVY8L56oxSM/50003 AND THIS HAS GROWN INTO THE WORK THAT I DO TODAY CALLED VARD RESTORED WHERE WE HAVE OVER 50
trainval/vVY8L56oxSM/50004 HE WANTED TO PAINT ON THE SAME WALLS WE HAD BEEN WORKING SO HARD TO TRY TO GET RESTORED
trainval/vVY8L56oxSM/50005 WE USED TO BE 5000 PEOPLE
trainval/vVY8L56oxSM/50006 THEY'RE THE ONES WHO DECIDE IN THIS VILLAGE
trainval/vVY8L56oxSM/50007 AND WE MANAGED TO COLLECT MATERIALS FROM OVER 40 BUILDINGS AND INCORPORATE THEM INTO THE LIBRARY
trainval/vVY8L56oxSM/50008 WHEN WE MADE THE ART PROJECT A SUCCESS IT WAS BECAUSE WE TOOK TIME TO TALK WITH ALL THE PEOPLE AND GET THE WHOLE
trainval/vVY8L56oxSM/50009 IS THIS INTERESTING FOR YOU
trainval/vw5HJhIlJp4/50001 BUT THEY HAD HUSTLED TO FEED THEIR KIDS AND PAY THEIR RENT
trainval/vw5HJhIlJp4/50002 WHY ARE YOU SO PASSIONATE
trainval/vw5HJhIlJp4/50003 AND THAT'S REALLY HOW I BECAME AN ENTREPRENEUR
trainval/vw5HJhIlJp4/50004 SO MAYBE YOU COULD INTERVIEW HER
trainval/vw5HJhIlJp4/50005 THE BIASES WHETHER INTENTIONAL OR OTHERWISE ARE PERVASIVE AND SO ARE THE MISLEADING MENTAL
trainval/vw5HJhIlJp4/50006 MICROFINANCE IS AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL TOOL THAT LEADS TO SELF SUFFICIENCY AND SELF RESPECT BUT WE MUST
trainval/vw5HJhIlJp4/50007 SHE SELLS CHOCOLATES
trainval/vw5HJhIlJp4/50008 AND SHE HAD COME TO WASHINGTON NOT SEEKING A HANDOUT AND NOT SEEKING A MICROLOAN
trainval/vw5HJhIlJp4/50009 SHE HAD COME SEEKING SERIOUS INVESTMENT DOLLARS SO THAT SHE COULD BUILD THE FACTORY AND BUY THE EQUIPMENT SHE
trainval/vw5HJhIlJp4/50010 WE DON'T NEED TO INVENT SOLUTIONS BECAUSE WE HAVE THEM CASH FLOW LOANS BASED IN INCOME RATHER THAN
trainval/vw5HJhIlJp4/50011 ORG THE MICROLENDER IS ACTUALLY NOW EXPERIMENTING WITH CROWDSOURCING SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED
trainval/vw5HJhIlJp4/50012 AND THAT'S JUST TO START
trainval/vw5HJhIlJp4/50013 AND NOT ONE COUNTRY IN ALL THE WORLD HAS ELIMINATED ITS ECONOMIC PARTICIPATION GAP
trainval/vw5HJhIlJp4/50014 WE HAVE SO MUCH ROOM TO GROW
trainval/vw5HJhIlJp4/50015 AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WOMEN THEY ARE EITHER EXCEPTIONS TO BE DISMISSED OR ABERRATIONS TO
trainval/vw5HJhIlJp4/50016 SO WHY WOULDN'T WE CELEBRATE AND ELEVATE THESE CHANGE MAKERS AND JOB CREATORS
trainval/vW99KFDSBk8/50001 THEY ARE ALL SUPPLIED WITH PLENTY OF WATER
trainval/vwhSTukb07U/50001 I WISH SHE SPOKE UP MORE
trainval/vwhSTukb07U/50002 EVENTUALLY I WAS LEFT WONDERING
trainval/vwhSTukb07U/50003 DO I HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY I AM IN ORDER TO STOP BEING CALLED OUT BY TEACHERS FOR SOMETHING THAT COMES SO NATURALLY TO
trainval/vwhSTukb07U/50004 I AM QUIET IN SCHOOL
trainval/vwhSTukb07U/50005 THE POWER OF INTROVERTS IN A WORLD THAT CAN'T STOP TALKING STATES IN HER OFFICIAL TED TALK THAT INTROVERTS
trainval/vwhSTukb07U/50006 AND DESPITE OUR LARGE PRESENCE INTROVERTS ARE NOT BEING ACKNOWLEDGED ENOUGH
trainval/vwhSTukb07U/50007 THEY HAVE FOR YEARS BEEN FOCUSING ON CATERING TO THE DIFFERENT LEARNING TYPES WHETHER IT BE VISUAL AUDITORY
trainval/vwhSTukb07U/50008 GRADES ASSIGNMENTS HOMEWORK
trainval/vWJwa7lntTs/50001 I NEVER PLANNED TO WRITE VIDEO GAMES BUT THESE MOMENTS THAT REALLY CHANGE OUR LIVES THEY OFTEN COME AS THE
trainval/vWJwa7lntTs/50002 WE MADE A VIDEO GAME THAT'S HARD TO PLAY
trainval/vWJwa7lntTs/50003 UNSPEAKABLY HARD AT TIMES BUT IT WAS ALSO PURE HOPE
trainval/vwTDeT4v7RM/50001 WE NEED ACTIVE SYSTEM
trainval/vwTDeT4v7RM/50002 AND HOW DO WE DO THAT
trainval/vXTFLMmOKV4/50001 I REALLY LOVE POETRY
trainval/vXTFLMmOKV4/50004 ONE SHOT OR TWO INHALED BY SOFT TISSUE STOMPED STRAIGHT ON ANOTHER DOWNSOUTH
trainval/vY2l2xfDBcE/50001 BUT WE KNOW THIS IS CRITICAL
trainval/vY2l2xfDBcE/50002 GO FIND ANOTHER BANK
trainval/vY2l2xfDBcE/50003 A HUNDRED PERCENT OF THEM WENT TO COLLEGE
trainval/vY2l2xfDBcE/50005 I NEED THAT DATA IN SEPTEMBER
trainval/vY2l2xfDBcE/50006 I NEED THAT DATA IN NOVEMBER
trainval/vY2l2xfDBcE/50007 BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS
trainval/vY2l2xfDBcE/50009 AND WE'VE GOT TO DO BETTER
trainval/vY2l2xfDBcE/50010 YOU'D BETTER STAY IN SCHOOL
trainval/VynSxLrtZaY/50001 AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS EXACTLY WHAT YOU'D EXPECT THAT SOME GROUPS WERE VERY MUCH MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN OTHERS
trainval/VynSxLrtZaY/50002 THE SWEDES EVEN HAVE A SPECIAL TERM FOR THIS
trainval/VynSxLrtZaY/50003 WHEN ALEX PENTLAND SUGGESTED TO ONE COMPANY THAT THEY SYNCHRONIZE COFFEE BREAKS SO THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE
trainval/VynSxLrtZaY/50004 WE'RE USED TO TALKING ABOUT STARS
trainval/vYV4tAq3wVg/50001 IT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT SPACE AND TIME
trainval/vYV4tAq3wVg/50002 MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT SURVIVING INSTEAD OF LIVING IS THE ONLY OPTION
trainval/vzi4AopBEBg/50001 FRESH OUT OF COLLEGE I WENT TO WORK FOR A CONSULTING FIRM
trainval/vzi4AopBEBg/50002 DURING ORIENTATION THE LEADERS DISHED OUT ADVICE
trainval/vzi4AopBEBg/50003 THEY RIDICULED RESIDENTS ASKING FOR HELP WHILE PUBLICLY INSISTING THAT THE BROWN SMELLY
trainval/vzi4AopBEBg/50004 HE WAS CHARACTERIZED A ROGUE EMPLOYEE AND SILENCED
trainval/vzi4AopBEBg/50005 AMONGST THEM WAS ONE PITHY COUNSEL I WILL NEVER FORGET
trainval/vzi4AopBEBg/50006 NOW WHEN I WAS GETTING INVOLVED WHEN I SAID YES TO THIS I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS
trainval/vzi4AopBEBg/50007 THIS WAS SCIENCE AND SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC
trainval/vzi4AopBEBg/50008 THIS IS WHAT I CAME TO GRADUATE SCHOOL FOR AND THIS IS HOW I WOULD RATHER SPEND MY LIFE
trainval/vzi4AopBEBg/50009 THIS GROUP AND MANY OTHERS GOT FLINT'S KIDS PROTECTED
trainval/vzi4AopBEBg/50010 THESE UNHEALTHY CULTURES THAT ARE FESTERING IN THESE GROUPS WHERE THE FOCUS IS ON MEETING REGULATIONS
trainval/vzi4AopBEBg/50011 EVERYONE WAS EXPECTED TO FOLLOW ORDERS COMING FROM THE TOP
trainval/vzi4AopBEBg/50012 IT WASN'T UNTIL I ARRIVED IN GRADUATE SCHOOL AND WITNESSED FIRSTHAND THE CRIMINAL ACTIONS OF
trainval/vzi4AopBEBg/50013 NOT ONE MENTION OF OUR MORAL AND PROFESSIONAL OBLIGATION OF PREVENTING HARM TO THE PUBLIC
trainval/vzi4AopBEBg/50014 I'M NOT SAYING EVERY SCIENTIST SHOULD BE AN ACTIVIST
trainval/vzi4AopBEBg/50015 THERE ARE REAL AND SOMETIMES VERY PAINFUL CONSEQUENCES OF SPEAKING UP
trainval/vzi4AopBEBg/50016 YOU KNOW WE FELL IN LOVE WITH SCIENCE WHEN WE WERE KIDS AND YET WE SOMEHOW SPEND MOST OF OUR TIME DURING HIGH
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50001 IN REALITY THAT'S WHAT MAKES GREAT RESEARCH AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES GREAT MEDICINE
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50002 THE PROBLEM IS PARTIAL THICKNESS THIS SECOND DEGREE BURN CAN PROGRESS TO A THIRD DEGREE BURN IF YOU DON'T
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50003 I WILL MAKE ANOTHER ASSERTION
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50004 THIS ONE IS GROUNDED ON BASIC FACT
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50005 IF I'M ABLE TO DRIVE DOWN THE STREET IT DOESN'T MAKE A WEIRD NOISE IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG THEN AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED MY
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50006 BUT THAT'S GOING ON AND IT'S STILL USED EVERYDAY JUST LIKE IT HAD BEEN 200 YEARS AGO
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50008 THEREFORE IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHAT EXACTLY IS GOING THROUGH THEIR BLOOD
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50009 THIS IS BOTH EXCITING AND SCARY TO A LOT OF PEOPLE BECAUSE IF WE CAN PERSONALIZE YOUR DIAGNOSIS PERSONALIZE YOUR MANAGEMENT MEDICINE
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50010 NOW I CAN PERSONALIZE MY KIDS
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50011 I'M HERE SOLELY AS SOMEONE WHO HAS DONE SOME WORK FOR A FEW YEARS IN A PRETTY EXCITING AREA AND I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT A
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50012 I LIKE BLUE EYES I WANT BLUE EYES FOR MY KIDS
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50013 THERE ARE INSTITUTIONS SAN DIEGO STATE MAJOR COMPANIES
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50014 THERE ARE HUGE GRANTS GOING AROUND PURELY TO TRY TO GET THE MONEY FROM THIS PRIZE
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50015 SO WHAT I'LL PRESENT HERE ARE A FEW ASSERTIONS AND THEN I'LL GO AT THE END AND ASK YOU A QUESTION
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50016 IT'S A PRETTY BOLD STATEMENT TO MAKE
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50017 THESE ASSERTIONS AREN'T FACT
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50018 AND BURNS DON'T ALL COME IN THE SAME SHAPE AND SIZE
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50019 I CAN SHOW YOU TWO BURNED PATIENTS WITH THE EXACT SAME BURNED AREA AND THEIR MODE OF MANAGEMENT IS PHENOMENALLY DIFFERENT
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50020 BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT MANAGEMENT OF THE INITIAL BURN INJURY
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50021 FEW PEOPLE WHO WILL SAY THINGS THAT ARE ALL ENCOMPASSING LIKE THIS ARE REALLY TRYING TO TELL YOU FACT THOSE WHO SAY THEY ARE ARE WRONG
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50022 IN FACT THE FDA ISN'T EVEN REALLY WORRIED ABOUT THE MANAGEMENT OF THE INITIAL BURN INJURY
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50023 WE GET A SCAR ON OUR HAND YOU KNOW I GOT A BAD PAPER CUT AND I GOT A TINY LITTLE SCAR
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50024 OK THAT'S OKAY
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50025 THIS GUY'S FACE IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE THAT FOREVER
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50026 BUT INSTEAD THEY'LL MAKE YOU THINK
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50027 YOU'LL AGREE YOU'LL DISAGREE
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50028 PATIENTS WITH NOT AS BAD WOUNDS DON'T USUALLY COST THIS MUCH
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50029 PATIENTS WHO WILL DIE BECAUSE OF THEIR BURN INJURIES COST HUNDREDS UPON HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO MANAGE
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50030 SO WHAT IS A BURN
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50031 I'M TALKING ABOUT THIS PRETTY ABSTRACTLY LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT BURNS ARE
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50032 YOU HAVE A GREAT TIME AT THE BEACH YOU GET A LITTLE BIT OF A SUNBURN YOU TURN RED YOU CAN'T SLEEP ON YOUR RIGHT SHOULDER AT NIGHT IT RUINS YOUR
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50033 THE FIRST ONE I'VE ALREADY SAID
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50034 THEREFORE I CAN MAKE YOUR TUMOR LIGHT UP
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50035 YOU HAVE TO KEEP A BURNED PATIENT'S HAND COMPLETELY STATIONARY UNDER THE MACHINE TO GET A GOOD READING
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50036 THE SIGNAL FOR A VISIBLE RED LIGHT GOES BARELY A MILLIMETER BELOW YOUR SKIN
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50037 FINALLY IT'S THE PURE BULK OF HAVING THIS APPARATUS IN YOUR BURN UNIT THAT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50038 THERE'S AN EXPENSE FACTOR THERE'S AN OPERATION FACTOR THERE'S A PURELY EXPERIENCE BASED TACTIC NOT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN ULTRASOUND
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50039 THAT MAKES WHATEVER READINGS YOU GET FROM THIS MACHINE NOT QUANTITATIVE AND BY THAT I MEAN THAT YOUR TEMPERATURE IS
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50040 YOU SEE RED THEREFORE CUT YOU SEE BLUE THEREFORE DON'T
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50041 THAT'S SIMPLY NOT GOOD ENOUGH WHEN TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IMPACTS A PATIENT'S LIFE SO MUCH
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50042 THAT MEANS I CAN WAVE AT YOU AND YOU'LL GET A READING FROM IT
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50043 I DON'T RECOMMEND YOU DO THAT IF WE ACTUALLY TAKE A SCAN IT'S NOT GREAT
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50044 BUT YOU GET THE IDEA OF WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET ACROSS
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50045 THEREFORE IF A MODEL WITH A PIG WORKS THEN IT IS MORE LIKELY TO WORK ON A HUMAN THAN IF WE WERE TO USE ANOTHER ANIMAL
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50046 5 CENTIMETER WOUND
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50048 IF I HAVE THAT STAMP I KNOW EXACTLY HOW DEEP THIS BURN GOES
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50049 SO I'M GOING TO GO TO ASSERTION NUMBER 3
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50050 BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS DYE GOING THROUGH YOUR BODY WE'VE JUST TALKED ABOUT BURNS WELL WHAT ELSE CAN WE USE WITH THIS
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50051 WHAT ELSE MAKES THIS SO COOL
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50052 THE ANSWER IS
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50053 DRIVING BACK HOME AND THEY'D NEED TO GET CALLED BACK IN BECAUSE HOURS AFTER THEIR SURGERY SOMETHING LOOKED LIKE IT WAS GOING
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50054 THIS APPLIES MOSTLY TO PATIENTS THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT WITH BREAST CANCER WHO NEED BREAST RECONSTRUCTIONS
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50055 THIS TYPE OF COMPROMISE OF SKIN DURING THE BREAST RECONSTRUCTION CAN OCCUR IN UP TO 40 OF PATIENTS
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50056 THAT IS A HUMONGOUS STRESS TO A PATIENT THAT'S ALREADY HAD CANCER
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50058 THERE IS A BIT OF DYING SKIN WE HAVE TO CUT AGAIN
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50059 I SHOULD DESCRIBE WHAT THAT IS
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50060 WHEN YOU HAVE A BREAST CANCER PATIENT YOU NEED TO KNOW WHETHER THE CANCER IS SPREADING
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50061 IT'S A PRETTY CRUDE MANAGEMENT BUT WE'VE GOTTEN REALLY GOOD AT IT
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50062 I HAVE A FINAL ASSERTION WHICH IS THAT WE'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50063 FROM THAT DIAGNOSTIC GOLDEN AGE WE WILL THEN ENTER A MANAGEMENT GOLDEN AGE
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50064 ONE MUST HAPPEN BEFORE THE OTHER
trainval/vzKA1y3cdYI/50065 SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THESE APPLICATIONS ALREADY AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO KEEP ON MOVING FORWARD
trainval/vZWokpaQ3NE/50001 WE WERE CHARGED WITH COMING UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT WAS GOING TO IMPROVE THIS PROCEDURE AS WELL AS IMPROVE
trainval/vZWokpaQ3NE/50002 THAT SOLUTION MIGHT HAVE TAKEN THE FORM OF A PIECE OF IMAGING SOFTWARE OR IT MIGHT HAVE TAKEN THE FORM OF A MEDICAL
trainval/vZWokpaQ3NE/50003 EVERY TIME YOU GET STRESSED OUT WE GET CLOSE TO A DEADLINE YOU WANT TO BAIL
trainval/vZWokpaQ3NE/50004 LET'S GIVE UP
trainval/vZWokpaQ3NE/50005 LET'S BE SLACKERS
trainval/vZWokpaQ3NE/50006 WELL WE GOT TO START SOMEWHERE WHAT IS THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE THING THAT WE COULD FOCUS ON
trainval/vZWokpaQ3NE/50007 ALRIGHT SO WHAT DO WE KNOW
trainval/vZWokpaQ3NE/50008 I FIND THAT IN ORDER TO GET UNSTUCK I FIRST HAVE TO GET OUT OF MY HEAD
trainval/vZWokpaQ3NE/50009 THEY BRING UP MICROCATHETERS SO THAT THERE'S SUPPORT AND THEY TRY TO NAVIGATE
trainval/vZWokpaQ3NE/50010 I KNOW YOU'RE ALL EXCITED ABOUT THIS
trainval/vZWokpaQ3NE/50011 AND THE REALITY IS IS YOUR EGO GETS ALL IN THE MIX
trainval/vZWokpaQ3NE/50012 AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO FORGET OURSELVES AND WE NEED TO FOCUS ON LEARNING AS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN
trainval/vZWokpaQ3NE/50013 BECAUSE IN THE BEGINNING WE WERE ALL GETTING CRANKY WHEN WE WERE GETTING INTO ANALYSIS PARALYSIS MODE
trainval/vZWokpaQ3NE/50014 BUT THEN WHEN WE STARTED PLAYING AROUND AND TALKING TO EACH OTHER THE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES HELPED US TO MAKE
trainval/vZWokpaQ3NE/50015 YOU CAN'T CONTROL YOUR WAY TO INNOVATION
trainval/vZWokpaQ3NE/50016 AND PEOPLE THAT ARE HAVING FUN THINK BETTER
trainval/vZWokpaQ3NE/50017 PAC MAN IS SAVING LIVES
trainval/vZWokpaQ3NE/50018 BECAUSE YOU ALL ACKNOWLEDGED IN THE BEGINNING THAT YOU GET STUCK SOMETIMES
trainval/vZWokpaQ3NE/50019 AND TO GET UNSTUCK I REMEMBER THE REVERSE PAC MAN AND THE LESSONS I LEARNED FROM IT
trainval/vZWokpaQ3NE/50020 AND HERE IS WHAT THOSE ARE
trainval/W0StyxgMk1o/50001 TOGETHER AS A SUM THEY ARE BIGGER THAN JUST ONE DECISION
trainval/W0StyxgMk1o/50002 UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T REALIZE IT ALWAYS
trainval/W0StyxgMk1o/50003 MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO OPEN AND FAST
trainval/W0StyxgMk1o/50004 WE STARTED TO LOOK AT FEATURES HOW TO CONNECT THE CAMERA APPLICATION TO THE INTERNET
trainval/W0StyxgMk1o/50005 AN INNOVATION AS YOU KNOW IS A HUGE BUSINESS DRIVER
trainval/W0StyxgMk1o/50006 BECAUSE THEY HAVE UNDERSTOOD THEY HAVE TO GAIN THIS CREATIVE CONFIDENCE TO INNOVATE WELL
trainval/W0StyxgMk1o/50007 I STARTED TO EXPERIMENT
trainval/W0StyxgMk1o/50010 ALL THIS THINGS NEED TO BE SOLVED
trainval/W0WOfMeWvsQ/50001 LET'S GO FORWARD
trainval/W0WOfMeWvsQ/50002 CORRUPTION IS RAMPANT
trainval/W1KIgMXPR28/50002 WHAT THAT MEANT THAT IF YOU STAYED OUT OF TROUBLE YOU'RE GOING TO STAY ALIVE
trainval/W1KIgMXPR28/50003 TEN MONTHS LATER I QUIT MY JOB
trainval/W1KIgMXPR28/50004 WAS I ABLE TO LIVE AS A COWARD LIKE EVERYONE ELSE OR WAS I GOING TO MAKE A STAND
trainval/w1TBZhdSsN0/50001 HOW COULD I IMAGINE SOMETHING WHICH I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO IMAGINE
trainval/w1TBZhdSsN0/50002 THIS LOOKS LIKE A CROCHET PATTERN
trainval/w1TBZhdSsN0/50003 THE SAME NIGHT I STARTED TO CROCHET
trainval/w1TBZhdSsN0/50004 SO I TRIED I HAD TO SLOW DOWN THIS EXPONENTIAL GROWTH AND MAKE THIS RATIO CLOSER TO ONE
trainval/w1TBZhdSsN0/50006 WELL WHAT IS A CURVATURE
trainval/w1TBZhdSsN0/50007 IF I WOULD BE IN A HYPERBOLIC PLANE I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO IT BECAUSE IF I WOULD TRY TO FOLD IT AND GET
trainval/w1TBZhdSsN0/50008 OH YEAH NOW THAT'S GREAT
trainval/w1TBZhdSsN0/50009 CROCHET INSTRUCTIONS IN A MATH JOURNAL
trainval/w1TBZhdSsN0/50010 IT'S THE BEST IF YOU CAN MAKE IT YOURSELF
trainval/w1TBZhdSsN0/50011 AND THEN SHE SAID
trainval/w2itwFJCgFQ/50001 WE FIRST CAPTURED THE DYNAMICS WITH A SET OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
trainval/w2itwFJCgFQ/50002 THE FIRST IS THAT GRAVITY ACTS ON ALL OBJECTS IN THE SAME WAY
trainval/w2mJMS09Qjk/50001 DURING THE RACE EVERYTHING CAME TOGETHER
trainval/w2mJMS09Qjk/50002 I SHOULD HAVE BEEN OPTIMISTIC ETC
trainval/w32u2NwCve0/50001 I WANTED TO BE AN ARCHAEOLOGIST UP UNTIL HIGH SCHOOL
trainval/W3C23m71Yws/50001 OR MAYBE THEY ARE BUT I JUST COULDN'T SEE IT BACK THEN
trainval/W3C23m71Yws/50002 PHARMACEUTICAL TECHNOLOGY DOES NOT
trainval/W3C23m71Yws/50003 BUT HERE'S THE BEST NEWS OF ALL
trainval/w3q89BTJj3o/50001 AND ALL OF THESE THINGS JUST KIND OF BECAME NORMAL TO ME AND I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT WOW THIS COULD BE CONNECTED TO
trainval/w3q89BTJj3o/50002 SO THROUGHOUT MY RESEARCH I BECAME REALLY INTO JUICING
trainval/w3q89BTJj3o/50003 I KEPT READING MORE AND MORE ABOUT THE VALUE OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND THE WAY THAT THE PHYTONUTRIENTS THE ENZYMES
trainval/w3q89BTJj3o/50004 JUICING IS A GREAT THING BECAUSE IT'S REALLY CONCENTRATED NUTRITION SO YOU CAN'T NECESSARILY SIT DOWN AND
trainval/w3q89BTJj3o/50005 AND I WAS PROBABLY ABOUT 14 AT THE TIME
trainval/w3q89BTJj3o/50006 I WOULD GET HOME AND JUICE
trainval/w3q89BTJj3o/50007 SO I WAS EATING A GREAT DIET AND I WAS EATING A LOT OF VARIETY IN MY DIET BUT I KEPT SHOWING UP
trainval/w3q89BTJj3o/50008 AND JUICING WAS REALLY MY KEY
trainval/w3q89BTJj3o/50009 YOU'RE ACTUALLY NOT ABSORBING WHAT YOU READ ON THAT LABEL BECAUSE YOUR BODY EXCRETES THE FIBER
trainval/w3q89BTJj3o/50010 THERE'S TWO TYPES OF JUICING
trainval/w3q89BTJj3o/50011 THE LITTLE JACK LALANNE JUICER THAT I STARTED ON IS CALLED A CENTRIFUGAL JUICER
trainval/w3q89BTJj3o/50012 SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT THAT WHEN YOU'RE BUYING ORGANIC PRODUCE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY
trainval/w3q89BTJj3o/50013 AND I HAD HAD SOME HEALTH ISSUES
trainval/w3q89BTJj3o/50014 IT'S ABOUT 100 POUNDS
trainval/w3q89BTJj3o/50015 SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY JUICE A DAY IN ADVANCE AND IT WILL STILL BE RICH IN ENZYMES VITAMINS AND MINERALS 24 HOURS
trainval/w3q89BTJj3o/50016 SO I MOVED TO SAN DIEGO FOR LAW SCHOOL AND I TOLD MY PARENTS ALL I NEED FOR SCHOOL IS THIS
trainval/w3q89BTJj3o/50017 GROWING UP I HAD REALLY BAD ECZEMA ALL OVER MY BODY
trainval/w3q89BTJj3o/50018 AND THEY WERE JUST LIKE WHAT
trainval/w3q89BTJj3o/50019 SO EVENTUALLY I GOT IT AS A JOINT BIRTHDAY CHRISTMAS PRESENT AND I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS JUST LIKE THE
trainval/w3q89BTJj3o/50020 I COULDN'T FIND IT
trainval/w3q89BTJj3o/50021 I COULDN'T GO TO A JUICE BAR
trainval/w3q89BTJj3o/50022 I COULDN'T BUY IT
trainval/w3q89BTJj3o/50023 AND NOW AT EVERY CORNER YOU SEE A JUICE BAR
trainval/w3q89BTJj3o/50024 THIS YOUNG FITNESS CULTURE EVERYBODY GOING TO YOGA CLASS GRABS A GREEN JUICE
trainval/w3q89BTJj3o/50025 IT WAS ON MY LEGS
trainval/w3q89BTJj3o/50026 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE JUICING TO REALLY GO ORGANIC BECAUSE JUICING REALLY MAKES ALL OF THE TOXINS IN THE
trainval/w3q89BTJj3o/50027 AND I THINK THAT IN GENERAL IN OUR SOCIETY NOW EVERYBODY'S STARTING TO SEE THEIR HEALTH DECLINE AND THEY'RE WONDERING
trainval/W3SRjJtd6Eo/50001 WELL LISTEN HERE IS THE PROBLEM
trainval/W3SRjJtd6Eo/50002 IT'S TO TRAIN AND DEVELOP
trainval/W3SRjJtd6Eo/50003 AND THEN MOVE ON TO THE NEXT STEP
trainval/W3SRjJtd6Eo/50004 SO I'LL ASK THE QUESTION
trainval/W3SRjJtd6Eo/50005 YOU CAN'T SAY
trainval/W3SRjJtd6Eo/50006 IT SAYS THAT IT'S ESTIMATED THAT OF YOUR WORKING AGE POPULATION OF PEOPLE WITH A DISABILITY THAT ARE
trainval/W3SRjJtd6Eo/50007 DO YOU KNOW WHY
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50001 IT WAS MY WAY
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50002 WOMEN JUST REALLY WANTED TO PARTICIPATE
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50003 AND I AM REALLY EXCITED TO BE TALKING TO THEM ABOUT IT
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50004 IT IS STILL MY WAY
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50005 THEY ARE WORRYING ABOUT IT ALONG WITH OTHER THINGS LIKE HOW THEY ARE GOING TO PAY THE BILLS HOW THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR PARENTS
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50006 THERE IS NO BABY PANIC
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50008 SO OF COURSE WHEN THE TIME CAME I WAS ON TOP OF THAT
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50009 I WAS ON TOP OF THAT
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50010 HAVING A BABY WITHOUT ENOUGH FOLIC ACID IN MY BLOOD WAS BAD
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50011 I EVEN ALMOST HAVE PH
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50012 BUT THEN I LOOK AROUND THEN I THINK OH
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50013 AND THERE ARE RISKS THAT YOUR CHILD MIGHT HAVE A PROBLEM
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50014 BUT I DON'T HAVE A PLAN
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50015 I'M NOT SURE HOW I FEEL ABOUT THAT
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50016 I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHAT A PLAN WOULD LOOK LIKE
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50017 AND I KNOW THAT I AM NOT ALONE
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50018 LOTS OF WOMEN ARE WAITING TO HAVE CHILDREN OR DECIDING NOT TO HAVE CHILDREN
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50019 IN 2008 THE AVERAGE AGE FOR A WOMAN TO HAVE HER FIRST CHILD WAS 25
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50020 THAT WAS THE AVERAGE AGE TO HAVE HER FIRST CHILD
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50021 ALSO IN 1970 ONLY 1 OUT OF 100 WOMEN HAD A BABY PAST AGE
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50023 DO I WANT TO RISK MY TRAINING THE PROFITABILITY I HAVE THE CAREER I WORKED FOR TO
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50024 AND THERE ARE POLICIES THAT WORK GREAT FOR THAT
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50025 IN SOME PLACES THESE ARE AVAILABLE
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50026 AND AMID THIS COMPLICATED SET OF FACTORS THOUGH WE SEE IN THE MEDIA
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50027 WHAT THEY WERE THINKING ABOUT IT
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50028 I DID MY RESEARCH I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WAY AHEAD OF TIME I READ EVERYTHING
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50029 AND HERE IS WHAT I FOUND
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50030 WHICH IT MAKES SENSE RIGHT
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50031 THERE IS NOBODY SAYING
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50032 IT HAS TO HAPPEN BY 30
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50033 IT HAS TO HAPPEN BY 35
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50034 AND THERE SHOULDN'T BE
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50035 THE WOMEN WHO ARE WORRIED ARE THE ONES WHO REALLY CARE ABOUT THIS TOPIC
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50036 WE NEED TO STOP DOING THAT
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50037 WHICH IS A GREAT THING
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50038 AND THAT WAS DIFFERENT ACROSS THE BOARD
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50039 AND THEN FOURTH I FOUND THAT HIGH LEVELS OF WORRY ABOUT FUTURE FERTILITY WERE NOT
trainval/W4I68CGUV3w/50040 LOTS OF WOMEN DON'T WANT TO HAVE KIDS
trainval/W4LYn4mIP18/50001 GOOD FOOD FOR OXFORD SCHOOLS WORKS IN THREE DIFFERENT AREAS
trainval/W4LYn4mIP18/50002 CONSIDERING I FEEL LIKE I'M A PRETTY FUN PERSON
trainval/W4LYn4mIP18/50003 WHEN CAN WE EAT THAT
trainval/W4LYn4mIP18/50004 IT CAN'T JUST STAY WITH THE KIDS
trainval/W4LYn4mIP18/50005 FARMER'S MARKETS ARE POPPING UP IN OUR COMMUNITY AND I'VE ONLY BEEN THERE FOR A YEAR AND A HALF DOING THIS TYPE OF
trainval/W4LYn4mIP18/50006 THEY ARE TAKING IT ON
trainval/W4LYn4mIP18/50007 WE'RE STARTING TO CREATE A FARM TO SCHOOL NETWORK IN THE STATE AND REALLY HELPING THESE PROJECTS THAT WERE
trainval/W4LYn4mIP18/50008 SO NOW IS THE TIME TO WORK TOWARDS THIS PARADIGM SHIFT THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT AND
trainval/w4RLfVxTGH4/50001 BUT HISTORIANS DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
trainval/w4RLfVxTGH4/50002 WE WANT THEM TO WIN
trainval/w4RLfVxTGH4/50003 THIS SHAPES HOW WE THINK ABOUT OUR HEALTH OUR RELATIONSHIPS HOW WE DECIDE HOW TO VOTE WHAT
trainval/w4RLfVxTGH4/50004 THIS MINDSET IS WHAT I'M PERSONALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT
trainval/w5T0wS1OdMo/50001 AND THEN BAXTER GOES TO WORK FOR THE REST OF THE DAY
trainval/w5T0wS1OdMo/50002 YOUR JOB IS TO MAXIMIZE IT
trainval/w5T0wS1OdMo/50003 YOU FIGURE OUT HOW
trainval/w5T0wS1OdMo/50004 YOU CAN CALL IT A DIGITAL ATHENS
trainval/w6vVXmwYvgs/50001 IN MY CLASSROOM I LIKE TO USE A STUDENT TEACHING STUDENT MODEL
trainval/w6vVXmwYvgs/50002 GENIUS HOUR IS BASED ON GOOGLE'S 20 POLICY WHERE KIDS WILL ACTUALLY GET 1 HOUR A
trainval/w6vVXmwYvgs/50003 BUT GUESS WHAT
trainval/W7kZWmw3JxY/50001 MY NERVES TOOK OVER EVERYTHING
trainval/w7rewjFNiys/50001 PETE BEACH FLORIDA AND WHEN I ARRIVED I FOUND ABOUT THREE APARTMENTS' WORTH OF STUFF CRAMMED IN A
trainval/w7rewjFNiys/50002 I KNOW MOM CERTAINLY DID
trainval/w8lH8tNlAXc/50001 OR DOES SOMEBODY WANT TO RUN A MARATHON OR DOES SOMEBODY WANT TO BALLROOM DANCE
trainval/w8lH8tNlAXc/50002 HOW WOULD YOU WANT TO ENHANCE A HUMAN BODY
trainval/w8lH8tNlAXc/50003 SHE TOOK MY HEART
trainval/W8OiVZrAj4c/50001 WE OPEN THE DOORS OUTSIDE AND THE WORLD CHANGES
trainval/W8OiVZrAj4c/50002 IT BECOMES POSSIBLE IN A WAY THAT JUST CAN'T HAPPEN INDOORS
trainval/W8OiVZrAj4c/50003 TO A PLACE THAT IS MORE THAN HUMAN
trainval/W8OiVZrAj4c/50004 WHAT ABOUT THOSE LANGUAGES THAT TELL US HOW TO MOVE ON THE GROUND HOW TO FOLLOW
trainval/W8OiVZrAj4c/50005 EVERY NEXT STEP IS A POSSIBILITY WHERE YOU HAVE TO DECIDE YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE
trainval/W8OiVZrAj4c/50007 GO OUT THERE
trainval/W8OiVZrAj4c/50008 YOU CAN STILL RUN INTO A BEAR AND BE SPEAKING WITH IT
trainval/W8OiVZrAj4c/50009 IT DIDN'T RUN TOO FAR IT RAN MAYBE ANOTHER 20 FEET TURNED AROUND AND STOOD ON ITS HIND LEGS JUST TO GET A
trainval/W8OiVZrAj4c/50010 JASPER SAID CAN I TAKE A PICTURE OF IT
trainval/W8OiVZrAj4c/50011 IT'S SAYING I'M VERY INTERESTED IN YOU
trainval/W8OiVZrAj4c/50012 WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME MAKING THE LAND ADJUST TO US MAKING THE WORLD CHANGE FOR
trainval/W8OiVZrAj4c/50013 HE SAID YOU KNOW WE WERE SO FOCUSED ON THE MOUNTAIN BACK THEN
trainval/W8OiVZrAj4c/50014 I WANT TO SEE HOW THE SUNRISE AFFECTS THIS CANYON IN A DIFFERENT WAY EVERY TIME
trainval/W8OiVZrAj4c/50015 THE CRACKS WERE MY ROUTES THE MAP WAS ONE TO ONE THE LAND ITSELF WAS THE MAP I
trainval/W8OiVZrAj4c/50016 WE NEED TO TRAVEL OUT THERE AND WE DON'T HAVE TO SUFFER OUT THERE
trainval/W8OiVZrAj4c/50017 WHEN YOU WATCH KIDS IT'S NOT JUST ALL BLOOD AND GUTS
trainval/W8OiVZrAj4c/50018 THAT'S ALL IT TAKES
trainval/W8OiVZrAj4c/50019 BUILD UP THAT LANGUAGE ENTER THAT WORLD
trainval/w96osGZaS74/50001 SO I DECIDED TO DO SOME RESEARCH
trainval/w96osGZaS74/50002 I WAS WORRIED
trainval/w96osGZaS74/50003 MY NEXT STOP WAS LANCASTER PENNSYLVANNIA AND I WASN'T SURE IF I WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO PULL IT OFF HERE IT'S KIND
trainval/w96osGZaS74/50004 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHILDREN AT SCHOOL WHO ARE TOO HUNGRY TO CONCENTRATE ELDERS WHO ARE STUCK AT HOME WITH
trainval/w96osGZaS74/50005 BUT TIME AFTER TIME PEOPLE WOULD COME UP TO ME AND ASK HEY CAN I EAT THIS FOOD
trainval/w96osGZaS74/50006 WELL OF COURSE I WANTED TO SAY YES
trainval/w96osGZaS74/50007 AND AT EVERY SINGLE ONE NEARLY EVERY MORSEL OF FOOD WAS TAKEN HOME AT THE END
trainval/w96osGZaS74/50008 WHY IS ALL THIS FOOD BEING WASTED
trainval/w96osGZaS74/50009 THERE IS ACTUALLY A HUGE NETWORK OF IT
trainval/w96osGZaS74/50010 SELL BY DATES SUGGESTED SELL BY DATES BEST BY DATES EXPIRATION DATES A LOT OF MYSTERY AROUND THEM
trainval/w96osGZaS74/50011 SUGGESTED SELL BY DATE IS A SUGGESTION AND BEST BY DATE DOES NOT SAY BAD AFTER
trainval/w96osGZaS74/50012 I BELIEVE WHERE THERE IS A WILL THERE IS A WAY
trainval/w96osGZaS74/50013 A VERY MINUSCULE AMOUNT
trainval/w96osGZaS74/50014 YOU GREW IT
trainval/W9wwvA5BRZc/50001 THEY FORMED A BOND
trainval/W9wwvA5BRZc/50002 WHAT HAPPENS THEN
trainval/W9wwvA5BRZc/50003 ALL OF THEIR HOMES WERE WASHED AWAY BY THE TSUNAMI TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO
trainval/W9wwvA5BRZc/50004 WELL LAST YEAR THAT NUMBER WAS 6
trainval/w9xg5TAhuJc/50001 AND AS I STARTED TO COME OUT TO MORE AND MORE PEOPLE I ENDED UP GETTING INTRODUCED TO OTHER WOMEN WHO WERE LIKE ME
trainval/w9xg5TAhuJc/50002 THEY NEVER LOVED ME BECAUSE I WAS STRAIGHT
trainval/W9YBCwgrwQA/50001 I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON THE BUSINESS RESULTS BECAUSE THAT'S AN AREA THAT I'M MORE FAMILIAR WITH
trainval/W9YBCwgrwQA/50002 HIGH EXECUTIVE'S FUNCTIONING SKILLS
trainval/W9YBCwgrwQA/50003 WHERE WOMEN WERE FOUND LACKING IN WHAT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT TODAY WERE IN TWO AREAS
trainval/W9YBCwgrwQA/50004 BUT WITH REGARD TO NEGOTIATING PROFITABLE DEALS I THINK THAT THERE IS A SUBSTANTIVE DIFFERENCE
trainval/W9YBCwgrwQA/50005 THAT'S THE ZERO SUM
trainval/W9YBCwgrwQA/50006 AND WOMEN ARE MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE AND THEREFORE MUCH MORE PERSUASIVE WHEN THEY'RE NEGOTIATING IN A POSITIVE SUM
trainval/W9YBCwgrwQA/50007 AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT 10 YEARS AGO I PROPOSED TEARING DOWN A 50 YEAR OLD COMPLETELY
trainval/W9YBCwgrwQA/50008 WE WERE GOING TO DO ALL THE THINGS THAT WE NEEDED TO DO AND WE WERE BRINGING IN A GREAT BUSINESS AND A GREAT EMPLOYER AND A GREAT
trainval/W9YBCwgrwQA/50009 WE DON'T WIN
trainval/W9YBCwgrwQA/50010 YOU CAN' FIGHT CITY HALL AND WIN
trainval/W9YBCwgrwQA/50011 WE WEREN'T KIND OF OUT IN THE STICKS
trainval/W9YBCwgrwQA/50012 BUT IT WAS AN AMAZING LESSON ABOUT HOW TO PERSUADE HOW TO BE PERSUASIVE IN A
trainval/W9YBCwgrwQA/50013 I MEAN THIS WAS THEIR HOMES BEHIND US THAT HAVE IN GROUND SWIMMING POOLS
trainval/W9YBCwgrwQA/50014 THAT IS MOST CERTAINLY THE MESSAGE
trainval/W9YBCwgrwQA/50015 AND I TRULY BELIEVE IT'S A PROBLEM THAT SOLVES ITSELF
trainval/W9YBCwgrwQA/50016 I MEAN THIS IS A FANCY PART OF TOLEDO
trainval/W9YBCwgrwQA/50017 AND WE NEED TO SURVEY YOUR HEIRLOOM TOMATOES IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE DOWN THIS FENCE
trainval/wa7H1A81bdM/50001 SO I KEPT DOING THIS
trainval/wAdwurHhvSI/50001 SO EVER SINCE THEN BEFORE I WOULD GO ANYWHERE I WOULD CALL THE FBI
trainval/wAdwurHhvSI/50002 YOU DON'T HAVE TO WASTE YOUR ENERGY OR YOUR RESOURCES
trainval/wAdwurHhvSI/50003 WHY WERE YOU THERE
trainval/wAdwurHhvSI/50004 WHO PAYS FOR YOUR TRIPS
trainval/wAdwurHhvSI/50005 I'M GOING TO PASS THIS ONTO THE TAMPA OFFICE
trainval/wAdwurHhvSI/50006 WELL THE FIRST ONE WAS IS YOUR NAME HASAN
trainval/wAdwurHhvSI/50007 IS TODAY TUESDAY
trainval/wAdwurHhvSI/50008 AND EVERYTHING'S AUTOMATED AT THE OTHER END
trainval/wAdwurHhvSI/50009 WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS
trainval/wAdwurHhvSI/50010 BECAUSE NO ONE'S REALLY WATCHING
trainval/wAdwurHhvSI/50011 I'M WATCHING WHO'S WATCHING ME
trainval/WaGq9XwSVys/50001 AND IF YOU ARE I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE EVEN OLYMPIC ATHLETES SPEND A LOT OF TIME OUT OF FIRST
trainval/WaGq9XwSVys/50002 I WON STUFF
trainval/WaGq9XwSVys/50003 MAN DID I LOVE IT
trainval/WaGq9XwSVys/50004 AND YOU NEVER KNOW YOUR BRONZE MIGHT JUST BE THE GOLD THAT YOU WERE SEARCHING FOR
trainval/WaGq9XwSVys/50005 WE ALSO SAW MOMENTS OF DISAPPOINTMENT ON THE PODIUM WHEN ATHLETES HAD COME SO CLOSE TO GOLD BUT
trainval/Wai4ub90stQ/50001 THESE CHANGES AND OTHERS LIKE THEM CHANGED THE WAY THAT PORTLANDERS LIVE AND THEIR VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED PER DAY THE
trainval/Wai4ub90stQ/50002 AND I LEARNED A NEW WORD LAST WEEK
trainval/Wai4ub90stQ/50003 AND WE TAKE CAR CRASHES FOR GRANTED
trainval/Wai4ub90stQ/50005 IT'S JAPAN IT'S FOUR PER 100000
trainval/Wai4ub90stQ/50006 DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S THREE PER 100000
trainval/Wai4ub90stQ/50007 IF WE CONTINUE TO PILE UPON OURSELVES IN CITIES AS THEY DO IN EUROPE WE SHALL BECOME AS CORRUPT AS THEY ARE IN EUROPE AND TAKE TO
trainval/Wai4ub90stQ/50008 WELL GUESS WHAT
trainval/Wai4ub90stQ/50009 YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF IT
trainval/Wai4ub90stQ/50010 AND YOU SEE THIS ALIGNMENT THIS STRANGE ALIGNMENT
trainval/wAIP6fI0NAI/50001 PEOPLE WOULD ADMIT SHAMEFUL SECRETS ABOUT THEMSELVES AND OTHER PEOPLE WOULD SAY OH MY GOD I'M EXACTLY THE
trainval/wAIP6fI0NAI/50002 YOU ARE THE WORLDWIDE NUMBER ONE TRENDING TOPIC ON TWITTER
trainval/wAIP6fI0NAI/50003 AND SO TO HER SHAME SHE WROTE SHE SHUT UP AND WATCHED AS JUSTINE'S LIFE GOT
trainval/wAIP6fI0NAI/50004 SOMEBODY WORKED OUT EXACTLY WHICH PLANE SHE WAS ON SO THEY LINKED TO A FLIGHT TRACKER WEBSITE
trainval/wAIP6fI0NAI/50005 AND IF SOMEBODY GETS IN THE WAY WE SCREEN THEM OUT
trainval/wAIP6fI0NAI/50006 IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF DEMOCRACY
trainval/wAIP6fI0NAI/50007 BUT IT WAS WORSE THAN THAT
trainval/wAIP6fI0NAI/50009 I FAVOR HUMANS OVER IDEOLOGY BUT RIGHT NOW THE IDEOLOGUES ARE WINNING AND THEY'RE
trainval/wAIP6fI0NAI/50011 WE WERE ALL SO EXCITED ABOUT DESTROYING JUSTINE AND OUR SHAMING BRAINS ARE SO SIMPLE MINDED THAT WE
trainval/waRCSCQnoeY/50001 YOU CAN LISTEN TO A PODCAST ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GROW UP DALIT IN KOLKATA
trainval/waRCSCQnoeY/50002 QUITE THE CONTRARY
trainval/waRCSCQnoeY/50003 AND THIS MAKES SENSE OF COURSE RIGHT
trainval/waRCSCQnoeY/50004 YOU WITH YOUR SHINY SKIN AND YOUR BIKE YOU'RE ANGRY AT ME
trainval/waRCSCQnoeY/50005 A RECENT REPORT BY THE PEW CENTER ON TRENDS IN AMERICA INDICATES THAT
trainval/WAuDCOl9qrk/50001 I MADE A COMPUTER OUT OF PEOPLE
trainval/WAuDCOl9qrk/50002 NOW WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
trainval/WAuDCOl9qrk/50003 IT'S A POWERFUL THING
trainval/WAuDCOl9qrk/50004 BUT IN 96 I MADE MY LAST PIECE
trainval/WAuDCOl9qrk/50005 AT RISD YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DRAW FROM AN IMAGE
trainval/wBObnvIZGwE/50001 WHAT IF I LIVE TO BE A 100
trainval/WbuIl6phdco/50001 HE HAD THIS HYPOTHESIS AND HE TESTED IT IN PEOPLE
trainval/WbuIl6phdco/50002 WE JUST HAVE BETTER STATISTICS
trainval/WbuIl6phdco/50003 IT CAN'T BE NETWORKED
trainval/WbuIl6phdco/50004 IT CAN'T BE INTEGRATED
trainval/WbuIl6phdco/50005 IT CANNOT BE USED BY PEOPLE WHO AREN'T CREDENTIALED
trainval/WbuIl6phdco/50006 IT WASN'T THE POINT
trainval/WbuIl6phdco/50007 PEOPLE YOU DON'T KNOW COME IN AND LOOK AT YOU AND POKE YOU AND PROD YOU AND WHEN I TELL CANCER SURVIVORS
trainval/WbuIl6phdco/50008 WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU
trainval/WbuIl6phdco/50009 WHEN I GOT THESE RESULTS I STARTED TALKING TO DOCTORS AND THEY TOLD ME NOT TO TELL ANYONE AND MY REACTION IS IS THAT GOING TO HELP
trainval/WbuIl6phdco/50010 IT'S NOT THE MOST SCIENCE POSITIVE STATE {LG}
trainval/WbuIl6phdco/50011 I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE POLITICS OF HEALTH CARE I'M TALKING ABOUT THE WAY WE SCIENTIFICALLY APPROACH HEALTH CARE
trainval/WbuIl6phdco/50012 IT'S TO BE NAKED DIGITALLY IN PUBLIC
trainval/WbuIl6phdco/50013 IT JUST TAKES ALL OF SOME OF US
trainval/wC33HAqSSx8/50001 HI THIS IS VLADIMIR I'M FROM MOSCOW AND WE HAVE THIS SLIGHT PROBLEM TRYING TO CONVERT OURSELVES
trainval/wC33HAqSSx8/50002 THAT'S THE POWER OF SELF ORGANIZING COMPLEX SOCIAL SYSTEMS
trainval/wC33HAqSSx8/50003 NO ONE REALLY PLANS THIS
trainval/wC33HAqSSx8/50004 NO ONE CAN GRASP ALL THE DETAILS OF THE LONDON BREAD SUPPLY CHAIN SYSTEM
trainval/wC33HAqSSx8/50005 BUT IT WORKS ANYWAY
trainval/wC33HAqSSx8/50006 AND IF THAT INSIGHT HAD BEEN IN PLACE IN SAY THE SOVIET UNION 1920 LOTS OF THE HORRORS OF THE
trainval/wC33HAqSSx8/50007 DO SOMETHING ELSE
trainval/wC33HAqSSx8/50008 PEOPLE CHANGE ALL THE TIME THE WORLD IS CHANGING AND YOU MAKE NEW DECISIONS EACH DAY
trainval/wC33HAqSSx8/50010 BUT THE HEROES OF THIS STORY ARE ACTUALLY THE ONES THAT MADE THE CONSCIOUS EFFORT TO CHANGE THEIR OPINION BECAUSE THAT'S A VERY
trainval/wc3VhvgUtB8/50001 THAT IS IN FACT WHAT THE GROUPS WHO MANAGE TO ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL DO DIFFERENTLY
trainval/wCf62ksaplI/50001 THIS STUDY POWERFULLY DEMONSTRATES THE UNSTABLE NATURE OF LANGUAGE IN SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
trainval/WCGuG0uT6ks/50001 AND YOU GO MY GOD IT'S REALLY FAR AWAY AND IT'S A GIANT WATERFALL
trainval/WCGuG0uT6ks/50002 AND YOUR BODY SOMEHOW KNOWS THAT
trainval/WCj82W7XkjI/50001 IN SEPTEMBER 2007 I WENT TO BANGLADESH WORKING WITH HABITAT FOR HUMANITY
trainval/WCj82W7XkjI/50002 WALKING THROUGH LAND THAT USED TO HAVE VILLAGES ON IT
trainval/WCj82W7XkjI/50003 LITERALLY GRABBED THE KIDS BY THE EARS DRAGGING THEM OFF THE COURT
trainval/WCj82W7XkjI/50004 THEY HAD NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE
trainval/WCj82W7XkjI/50005 THAT YOU CAN BE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO BE YOU CAN BE WHOEVER YOU WANT TO BE BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY VALUE
trainval/WCj82W7XkjI/50006 IT'S THE SAME THING IN BANGLADESH
trainval/WCj82W7XkjI/50007 AND I GOT THE CALL THAT HE PASSED AWAY
trainval/WCj82W7XkjI/50008 NOW LET'S SEE IF WE CAN PAY FOR THE FUNERAL
trainval/WCj82W7XkjI/50009 SO WE RING UP BANGLADESH AND SAY HEY WHATEVER YOU PAID FOR THE FUNERAL PLEASE LET US KNOW WE'LL PROVIDE YOU WITH THAT AS WELL AS A
trainval/WCj82W7XkjI/50010 THAT'S REALLY HARD TO DEAL WITH
trainval/WCj82W7XkjI/50011 WHY WAS HE JUST LAYING ON THE TABLE
trainval/WCj82W7XkjI/50012 WHY WOULD WE PUT THE GUY IN THE GROUND
trainval/WCj82W7XkjI/50013 THAT'S A TOUGH REALITY
trainval/WCj82W7XkjI/50014 I TELL THESE STORIES NOT TO MAKE YOU SAD SO I HOPE AS THE FIRST SPEAKER THIS DOESN'T GET YOU DOWN FOR THE REST OF
trainval/WCj82W7XkjI/50015 I HOPE YOU THINK ABOUT THAT FOR THE REST OF THE DAY
trainval/wcSMzf3ztcs/50001 SO THE MEDIA WE ARE SHOWN CAN AFFECT SOCIETY BY AFFECTING THE WAY WE VIEW DIVERSE GROUPS
trainval/wcWD7fERQCc/50001 I CAN TRACK YOU
trainval/wcWD7fERQCc/50004 WE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED THE VESTIBULO OCULAR REFLEX TO TRACK THINGS WITH OUR EYES LIKE THIS
trainval/wcWD7fERQCc/50005 I CAN MOVE MY HEAD
trainval/wcWD7fERQCc/50006 HE'S AN AUDIO ENGINEER
trainval/wcWD7fERQCc/50009 WELL HECK YEAH IT DOES
trainval/wcWD7fERQCc/50010 YOU CAN DO THAT
trainval/wD3S6JIUF7M/50001 ONLY HALF OF THE US STATES MENTION MORE THAN A SINGLE TRIBE AND JUST FOUR STATES MENTION THE
trainval/wD3S6JIUF7M/50002 PLEASE DO SOMETHING
trainval/wD3S6JIUF7M/50003 THEY ARE NATIVE PEOPLE BEING PUSHED OFF THEIR HOMELANDS FROM RISING SEA LEVELS
trainval/wD3S6JIUF7M/50004 ONE IN THREE NATIVE WOMEN ARE RAPED IN HER LIFETIME
trainval/wD3S6JIUF7M/50005 WE WERE SO EMPOWERED
trainval/wD3S6JIUF7M/50006 THAT FOOD YOU EAT COMES FROM SOMEWHERE
trainval/wD3S6JIUF7M/50007 HOW CAN YOU HELP
trainval/wD3S6JIUF7M/50008 THE TAP WATER YOU DRINK COMES FROM SOMEWHERE
trainval/wD3S6JIUF7M/50009 IT SHAPES THE WAY WE TEACH
trainval/wD3S6JIUF7M/50010 ARE YOU MEETING THOSE REQUIREMENTS
trainval/wD3S6JIUF7M/50011 THAT WOULD CHANGE OUR LIVES IF TREATIES WERE ACTUALLY UPHELD
trainval/wD3S6JIUF7M/50012 IT'S IN OUR PLANTS IN OUR MEDICINES IN OUR LIVES EVERY SINGLE DAY
trainval/wDkH7Qpu6V4/50001 HOW IN THE WORLD COULD I SAY NO
trainval/wDxjss7kHRw/50001 WE SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE AND WE LIVE IN THE SAME FAMILY
trainval/wDxjss7kHRw/50002 LIFE HAPPENS IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME
trainval/wDxjss7kHRw/50003 IN AVIATION IT IS SCARY WHEN LIFE HAPPENS
trainval/wDxjss7kHRw/50004 BUT IT TURNS OUT IT WAS THE LANGUAGE
trainval/wDxjss7kHRw/50005 IT WAS A LANGUAGE ISSUE
trainval/wDxjss7kHRw/50006 I'M FINE AND YOU
trainval/wDxjss7kHRw/50007 IT SEEMS LIKE AN IMPORTANT THING
trainval/wDxjss7kHRw/50008 I KNOW WHAT LANGUAGE STANDARDS ARE
trainval/wDxjss7kHRw/50009 I HAD NO IDEA EXCEPT TO SAY PLEASE GOD THIS IS WAY BIGGER THAN ME
trainval/wDxjss7kHRw/50010 SO I DECIDED I HAD TO LEARN HOW TO FLY
trainval/wDxjss7kHRw/50011 AND THE BABY PILOT I AM I SEE I AM WAY TOO HIGH I SEE THE RUNWAY WAY OVER THERE
trainval/wDxjss7kHRw/50012 FOR ME AVIATION ENGLISH CAME AT A JUNCTION WHERE MY BACKGROUND AND
trainval/wDxjss7kHRw/50013 WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE NATIONAL PRIDE
trainval/weCFbknwZa8/50001 BECAUSE THERE IS SUCH A STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH STRESS AND MENTAL HEALTH
trainval/weCFbknwZa8/50002 YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THE TYPES OF STRESSES WE FACE IN THE MODERN WORLD ARE VERY DIFFERENT TO OUR CAVEMEN
trainval/weCFbknwZa8/50003 BUT IF NOT WE BECOME STRESSED
trainval/weCFbknwZa8/50004 PUT SIMPLY IT'S A SITUATION OR AN EVENT THAT EXCEEDS OR IS PERCEIVED TO EXCEED
trainval/weCFbknwZa8/50005 AND THIS RESULTS IN AN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE AND A BIOLOGICAL ADAPTATION SUCH AS
trainval/weCFbknwZa8/50006 SO STRESS IS SOMETHING OF AN EVENT THAT IS OUT OF OUR CONTROL THAT WE FEEL WE CAN'T COPE WITH AND CAUSES A
trainval/weCFbknwZa8/50007 SO IT'S A GOOD THING IT'S OUR FIGHT AND FLIGHT RESPONSE IT PROMOTES THE SURVIVAL OF THE
trainval/weCFbknwZa8/50008 THIS MEANS THEY ARE UNDER REGULATION OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM DURING STRESS
trainval/weCFbknwZa8/50009 AND THIS MAY HELP US PROMOTE BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES
trainval/weCFbknwZa8/50010 ONLY THE SOLDIERS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM RESPOND
trainval/weCFbknwZa8/50011 IT PROMOTES A PROTECTION AGAINST INFECTIONS
trainval/weCFbknwZa8/50014 AND IN THE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE VERY LITTLE SOCIAL SUPPORT IF YOU ACTUALLY PROVIDE THEM WITH A SUPPORT NETWORK THEIR IMMUNE
trainval/weCFbknwZa8/50015 AND WE MAY BE ABLE TO IMPROVE THEIR IMMUNE FUNCTION AND IMPROVE THEIR OVERALL WELLBEING
trainval/weCFbknwZa8/50016 AND WE NEED TO ENGAGE THE POLICY MAKERS
trainval/weCFbknwZa8/50017 SO HOW DOES THE PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE TO STRESS MANIFEST IN THE MODERN ERA
trainval/weCFbknwZa8/50019 IT'S ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THE MOST COMMON DISEASES FACING THE MODERN WORLD SUCH
trainval/weCFbknwZa8/50020 THESE ARE SOME OF THE BIGGEST KILLERS CURRENTLY IN SOCIETY
trainval/weCFbknwZa8/50021 BUT DESPITE THIS AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT STRESS MANAGEMENT IS EASY AND AFFORDABLE TO
trainval/weCFbknwZa8/50022 SO WE REALLY NEED TO ENCOURAGE THE POLICY MAKERS TO TAKE STRESS SERIOUSLY AND PUT IT UPON THE
trainval/wEM9c7RoVms/50001 SO I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION
trainval/wEM9c7RoVms/50002 MY FAVORITE PASS TIME IS SLEEPING AND DREAMING
trainval/wEM9c7RoVms/50003 LIKE WHO HAD EVER THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD HAVE ONE DAY SOMETHING LIKE A MOBILE PHONE
trainval/wEM9c7RoVms/50004 I MEAN WHEN I WAS A CHILD IF SOMEBODY SAID SOMEBODY IS LIKE THIS I WOULD HAVE SAID IMPOSSIBLE
trainval/wEM9c7RoVms/50005 BUT TODAY WE ALL HAVE MOBILE PHONES
trainval/wEM9c7RoVms/50006 GOODNESS I MEAN I'M ASTONISHED RIGHT NOW
trainval/wEM9c7RoVms/50007 AND YOUR IMPOSSIBLE WILL BECOME POSSIBLE
trainval/wEM9c7RoVms/50008 BELIEVE ME IT WILL
trainval/weWl6PqAdHY/50001 AND SHE IS PAVING THE WAY AND SHOWING WHAT'S
trainval/weyd0UMdP7g/50001 HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER CROPS
trainval/weyd0UMdP7g/50002 THEY DO NOT
trainval/weyd0UMdP7g/50003 SO IN ANOTHER STUDY WE DID WE USED PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA ABOUT SEARCHES IN GOOGLE
trainval/weyd0UMdP7g/50004 TO ME WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THE PRINCIPLE
trainval/WF6SDe4USvE/50001 THAT'S WHY I LIKE WHAT I DO
trainval/WfDSFRPjQTo/50001 I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED THIS OR NOT
trainval/WfDSFRPjQTo/50002 GOING BACK TO THAT STORMTROOPER IF I DID GET THAT CHEST PLATE OFF IN TIME WHAT WOULD YOU
trainval/WfDSFRPjQTo/50003 I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH ONE POINT
trainval/WFImhWa5oUw/50001 HE HAD NO FAMILY TO SUPPORT HIM
trainval/WfjzkO6SDEI/50001 THINK ABOUT IT
trainval/WfjzkO6SDEI/50002 I HAD TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT AND STOP COLLUDING
trainval/WfjzkO6SDEI/50003 IT IS NOT HAVING A VAGINA THAT MAKES LIFE HARDER FOR WOMEN
trainval/wfNX1cHkSfE/50001 HE WOULD SAY
trainval/wfNX1cHkSfE/50002 HAPPY AT WORK
trainval/wfNX1cHkSfE/50003 WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT HAPPY
trainval/wfNX1cHkSfE/50004 I THINK IT'S BECAUSE WHEN WE ARE IN DOUBT WE LOOK TO OUR RESUME
trainval/wfNX1cHkSfE/50005 THAT'S WHAT DETERMINES HOW EACH EGG IS UNIQUE
trainval/wfNX1cHkSfE/50006 IT COMES FROM WHO YOU GET TO BE WHILE YOU'RE DOING THAT JOB
trainval/wfNX1cHkSfE/50007 THE ANSWER CAME TO ME IN A FLASH
trainval/wfNX1cHkSfE/50008 I NEEDED TO ALLOW THE DREAM TO CHANGE FORM
trainval/wfNX1cHkSfE/50009 BUT WHEN WE GO TO PICK THAT COLLEGE MAJOR THE QUESTION CHANGES FROM WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP
trainval/wfNX1cHkSfE/50010 BUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT THIS SUBJECT I THINK OF MY GRANDFATHER MY IMMIGRANT GRANDFATHER WHO LEFT POLAND
trainval/wfNX1cHkSfE/50011 BUT AT THE TIME WE MET HE WASN'T SURE WHAT HE WANTED TO DO NEXT
trainval/wfNX1cHkSfE/50012 SHE WAS A TOP SALESPERSON SHE WON ALL THE CARS ALL THE TRIPS BUT SHE STARTED TALKING ABOUT HOW SHE WAS
trainval/wfNX1cHkSfE/50013 ALL THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED WHICH MADE THAT RESUME THAT MADE YOUR LIFE STORY THAT'S WHAT REVEALS YOUR BLUEPRINT
trainval/wfNX1cHkSfE/50014 EVERYONE'S UNIQUE WE DON'T CROSS OVER WE DON'T HAVE TO COMPETE
trainval/wfNX1cHkSfE/50015 BUT IT'S AN EPIDEMIC THAT HAS A CURE
trainval/wfNX1cHkSfE/50016 AND THEN WHAT DO YOU DO
trainval/wfW3aZCFfLA/50001 IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FOR INSTANCE WE HAVE HAD AN ENORMOUS INCREASE IN ABUSE
trainval/wfW3aZCFfLA/50002 WHEN I BECAME PRESIDENT THE DIFFERENCE WAS 39 PERCENT
trainval/wfW3aZCFfLA/50003 SO WE'VE MADE SOME PROGRESS PARTIALLY BECAUSE I WAS PRESIDENT
trainval/wfW3aZCFfLA/50004 I DIDN'T EVEN GO DOWN TO DETAIL ABOUT THAT
trainval/WGBTz8ciZLg/50001 THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I DID
trainval/wgKmdbTmbDk/50001 WHAT IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF STRESS IN YOUR LIFE
trainval/wgKmdbTmbDk/50002 NO ONE HAD EVER DONE IT
trainval/wgPLGS1BvQo/50001 THE ELVIS IS ALIVE PEOPLE
trainval/wgPLGS1BvQo/50002 THEY ARE THE SAME
trainval/wgPLGS1BvQo/50003 WHAT DID THEY HAVE
trainval/wgPLGS1BvQo/50004 I PUBLISHED MY WORK THE BOOK WAS PUBLISHED DENYING THE HOLOCAUST
trainval/wgPLGS1BvQo/50005 THE GROWING ASSAULT ON TRUTH AND MEMORY IT CAME OUT IN MANY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES INCLUDING HERE IN PENGUIN UK
trainval/wgPLGS1BvQo/50006 HE HADN'T ALWAYS BEEN A HOLOCAUST DENIER BUT IN THE LATE 80S HE EMBRACED IT WITH GREAT
trainval/wgPLGS1BvQo/50007 IPSO FACTO I DAVID IRVING AM NOT A HOLOCAUST DENIER
trainval/wgPLGS1BvQo/50008 AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T SEEN DENIAL SPOILER ALERT
trainval/wgPLGS1BvQo/50009 THIS WAS NOT A MAN WHO SEEMED AT ALL ASHAMED OR RETICENT ABOUT BEING A HOLOCAUST DENIER
trainval/wgPLGS1BvQo/50010 HIS VIEW OF HISTORY WAS TENDENTIOUS HE LIED HE DISTORTED AND MOST
trainval/wgPLGS1BvQo/50011 WE SHOWED A PATTERN IN OVER 25 DIFFERENT MAJOR INSTANCES
trainval/wgPLGS1BvQo/50012 NOT IN MOST CASES AND NOT IN THE PREPONDERANCE OF CASES BUT IN EVERY SINGLE INSTANCE WHERE HE MADE SOME
trainval/wgPLGS1BvQo/50013 BUT HERE WAS THE PROBLEM
trainval/wgPLGS1BvQo/50014 I'M REMINDED OF A NEW YORKER CARTOON
trainval/wgPLGS1BvQo/50015 WE MUST HOLD THEIR FEET TO THE FIRE
trainval/wgPLGS1BvQo/50016 THE TIME TO FIGHT IS SHORT
trainval/Wgt8QUHQjw8/50001 ANOTHER GROUP SIMILARLY FOUND AUTOMATIC RESPONSES TO BEAUTY WITHIN OUR PLEASURE
trainval/Wgt8QUHQjw8/50002 WITHIN THE ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX THERE'S OVERLAPPING NEURAL ACTIVITY IN RESPONSE TO
trainval/Wh9O3SciOYs/50001 I BELIEVE THAT TRAUMA IS THE NUMBER ONE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN OUR COUNTRY
trainval/WHjKnNbYiOs/50001 IMAGINE WORLDWIDE HOW A TROVE OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN
trainval/WHjKnNbYiOs/50002 THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT TRANSFORMED ME FROM A MEDIEVAL SCHOLAR A READER OF TEXTS INTO A
trainval/WHjKnNbYiOs/50003 WHAT AN UNSATISFYING WORD READER IS
trainval/WHjKnNbYiOs/50004 I READ AND TAUGHT THE SAME CLASSICS THAT PEOPLE HAD BEEN READING AND TEACHING FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS
trainval/WHjKnNbYiOs/50005 AND SO OUT OF THE BLUE I DECIDED TO WRITE TO THE LEAD IMAGING SCIENTIST ON THE ARCHIMEDES PALIMPSEST
trainval/WHjKnNbYiOs/50006 THERE ARE ABOUT FIVE OF THESE IN THE WORLD
trainval/WIebxoTx408/50001 AND I HAD VERY NICE FLAT NORMAL BLOOD SUGARS
trainval/WIebxoTx408/50003 AND I KIND OF DO UNDERSTAND THE LINK BETWEEN CHOCOLATE AND LIVING BUT IN ANY CASE I WAS
trainval/WIebxoTx408/50004 SO WHAT WOULD YOU DO
trainval/WIebxoTx408/50005 SO I REALLY BELIEVE IN KNOWLEDGE AND TRAINING
trainval/WIebxoTx408/50006 AN UNTREATED DIABETIC MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE AS MUCH AS 14 PERCENT
trainval/WIebxoTx408/50007 BUT THE ULTIMATE POWER IS YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE RIGHT
trainval/WIebxoTx408/50008 SO I DID THE N 1 EXPERIMENT
trainval/WIebxoTx408/50009 SO N MEANING JUST ONE SUBJECT RIGHT
trainval/WIebxoTx408/50010 AND WHILE MOST PEOPLE CAN TOLERATE A FAIR AMOUNT OF CARBOHYDRATE THERE MIGHT BE A CERTAIN AMOUNT
trainval/WiGZGBowXQg/50001 OSCAR WILDE ONCE SAID AN ECONOMIST KNOWS THE PRICE OF EVERYTHING BUT THE VALUE OF
trainval/wIkvIKeRNoY/50001 BUT THEY'LL ALSO THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE WHAT IMPACT IS IT GOING TO HAVE ON THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT
trainval/wIkvIKeRNoY/50002 SO ACTUALLY IF YOU WANT TO GO AND MAKE YOUR OWN MINI CEMETERY THEN YOU CAN
trainval/wIkvIKeRNoY/50003 BUT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT FOR FORMAL REQUIREMENTS
trainval/wIkvIKeRNoY/50004 ONLY 45 PERCENT OF PEOPLE HAVE EVER TALKED ABOUT THIS
trainval/wIkvIKeRNoY/50005 AND THE REASONS THAT PEOPLE GIVE
trainval/wIkvIKeRNoY/50006 BUT WHEN IT COMES TO OUR CITIES AND THINKING ABOUT HOW DEATH FITS IN OUR CITIES THERE'S MUCH LESS
trainval/WiNI6INAytE/50001 KAREN BENTRUP OUR VOLUNTEER GARDEN MANAGER AND I STOOD BEHIND THE SCIENCE BUILDING AND VIEWED THE WASTED
trainval/Wj4E90stS2c/50001 WE CHOOSE ONE IDEOLOGY AND WE ADOPT IT WHOLESALE
trainval/Wj4E90stS2c/50002 AND SO THIS USED TO BE UNDERSTANDABLE RIGHT
trainval/Wj4E90stS2c/50003 WE COULDN'T VOTE ON EVERY ISSUE BECAUSE THE ONLY TECHNOLOGY WE HAD WAS PEN AND PAPER AND A
trainval/Wj4E90stS2c/50004 SO HOW CAN I BE SO SURE ABOUT THIS
trainval/Wj4E90stS2c/50005 THEY HAVE REALLY POWERFUL PROCESSES
trainval/Wj4E90stS2c/50006 THEIR JOB IS TO HELP THE GROUP DECIDE
trainval/Wj4E90stS2c/50007 AND THAT'S WHAT DEMOCRACY IS
trainval/Wj4E90stS2c/50008 AND THE ANSWER IS IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING
trainval/Wj4E90stS2c/50009 WELL IN ESTONIA THEIR E RESIDENCY PROGRAM ASKS USERS FOR FEEDBACK TO SUCH A
trainval/Wj4E90stS2c/50010 SO DON'T GET ME WRONG
trainval/Wj7hmzfX5eQ/50001 ONE OF MY ROLE MODELS AND SOURCE OF INSPIRATION BREN BROWN ONCE STATED THOSE WORDS
trainval/Wj7hmzfX5eQ/50002 PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS PILED ON ANXIETY CREPT IN
trainval/Wj7hmzfX5eQ/50003 HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO SEE MYSELF THIS IMAGE OF A LEADER OF A SUCCESSFUL AND WORTHY PERSON IF I COULD NOT
trainval/Wj7hmzfX5eQ/50004 THIS WILL GIVE ME SUCCESS IN THE POOL
trainval/Wj7hmzfX5eQ/50005 I REFUSED TO FACE WHAT WAS BEING DEALT TO ME
trainval/Wj7hmzfX5eQ/50006 I TURNED TOWARDS THE CONTROL THAT ANOREXIA THAT ED WAS GIVING ME
trainval/Wj7hmzfX5eQ/50007 IT'S THIS ODD PUZZLE EATING DISORDER ARE IN THAT FROM THE INSIDE LOOKING OUT YOU LONG FOR
trainval/Wj7hmzfX5eQ/50009 BUT YOU HAVE ITS VOICE SCREAMING IN YOUR HEAD THAT YOU'RE FAT THAT YOU'RE WORTHLESS YOU
trainval/Wj7hmzfX5eQ/50010 NO LONGER DID I CARE ABOUT MY HIPS MY SWIMMING ACADEMICS MY FRIENDS MY HEALTH
trainval/Wj7hmzfX5eQ/50011 I ADMITTED I HAD A PROBLEM
trainval/Wj7hmzfX5eQ/50012 I ADMITTED THIS WAS MY LIFE
trainval/Wj7hmzfX5eQ/50013 WE DEALT WITH OUR ANXIETIES IN VERY SIMILAR WAYS
trainval/Wj7hmzfX5eQ/50014 NOT AT FIRST OF COURSE BUT AFTER MY RESIDENTIAL STAY AND GOING TO LIVE WITH MY DAD FOR A WHILE I LEARNED MORE AND
trainval/Wj7hmzfX5eQ/50015 I TOOK A SEMESTER OFF OF SCHOOL IN 2013
trainval/Wj7hmzfX5eQ/50016 FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS FLED BACK IN AND I HAD A CHOICE
trainval/Wj7hmzfX5eQ/50017 I COULD CHOOSE TO LET MY ED TAKE OVER TO HAVE MY BRAIN TELL ME TO STARVE TO RUN WHEN I WASN'T ALLOWED TO
trainval/wjWSv0IPTSM/50001 AND THERE IS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BEING SPENT ON THAT
trainval/wjXClLxcFTQ/50001 I WASN'T MUCH DIFFERENT
trainval/wjXClLxcFTQ/50002 WE SAW EACH OTHER EVERY DAY
trainval/wjXClLxcFTQ/50003 I'M FROM HUEYTOWN ALABAMA
trainval/wJxSRo564Dc/50001 I SAIL THE WORLD
trainval/wKIHuxe2fi0/50001 SO JUST LIKE ARCHEOLOGISTS WHO DIG THE CENTURIES OLD RUBBISH
trainval/wKIHuxe2fi0/50002 IT IS CLEARLY LINKED TO ONE SINGLE EVENT
trainval/wKIHuxe2fi0/50004 I THEN TWEETED ABOUT IT
trainval/wKIHuxe2fi0/50005 THAT'S FINE BECAUSE I'M NOT 100 CONVINCED MYSELF
trainval/WKlIytaSlu4/50001 I STUMBLED AND MUMBLED AS I RESPONDED
trainval/WKlIytaSlu4/50002 THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY YOUNG AFRICAN CHILDREN DIE
trainval/WKlIytaSlu4/50003 AFRICA HAS HAD A MIXED AFFAIR WITH ORGANIZED RELIGION WITH BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE
trainval/WKlIytaSlu4/50004 NOW BOTH ISLAM AND CHRISTIANITY UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF SOCIAL IMPACT AS CRITICAL
trainval/WKlIytaSlu4/50005 BY CLAIMING THAT WE HAVE NO POWER OVER OUR PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE WE GIVE TOO MUCH
trainval/WKlIytaSlu4/50006 THAT WOULD DEMONSTRATE WHAT WE PREACH AND WHAT WE SPEAK ABOUT AS PEOPLE OF FAITH
trainval/WkNpElapS9s/50001 WHEN I PICKED UP MY DAUGHTER THAT AFTERNOON SHE WAS VISIBLY UPSET
trainval/WkNpElapS9s/50002 THAT'D MEAN WE HAD NO MONEY FROM MARKETING OR PR
trainval/WkNpElapS9s/50003 HER NAME WAS ELLIE
trainval/WKXmw7uZc5U/50001 AND I WAS AN AMAZING ART STUDENT
trainval/WKXmw7uZc5U/50002 BUT ONCE I FINISHED THE PROGRAM I PROMPTLY FELL APART
trainval/WKXmw7uZc5U/50003 ON JANUARY 15TH I SENT AN EMAIL TO ALL MY FRIENDS AND RELATIVES DESCRIBING MY
trainval/WKXmw7uZc5U/50004 BUT I HAVE A FEELING THAT YOU MAY APPRECIATE IT IF I TALKED ABOUT THEM AS A WHOLE RATHER THAN PIECE BY
trainval/WLMJHdySgE8/50002 I READ A STUDY THAT ASKED LITTLE CHILDREN WHAT WORRIES THEM MOST
trainval/WLMJHdySgE8/50003 IS JACK WORRIED ABOUT BEING HIT
trainval/WLMJHdySgE8/50004 AND I DON'T MEAN SPANKING
trainval/WLMJHdySgE8/50005 BUT THE TROUBLE IS YOU ONLY HAVE THREE AND IF YOU GIVE UP ALL THREE REMINDER STICKS YOU HAVE TO SIT OUT
trainval/WLMJHdySgE8/50006 SO WHY IS THIS
trainval/WLMJHdySgE8/50007 HE'S SERVED SEVERAL TOURS IN AFGHANISTAN
trainval/WLMJHdySgE8/50008 HE'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE PEOPLE
trainval/Wm0GKnd3JvA/50001 BUT I'VE NEVER QUITE GOTTEN A PROBLEM LIKE FOLD WHATEVER YOU WANT
trainval/Wm0GKnd3JvA/50002 AND MY ART SKILLS WERE CRAPPY
trainval/Wm0GKnd3JvA/50003 AND IF YOU ARE SURE OF WHERE YOU'RE GOING I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THE SECOND STORY OF HAVING ENOUGH
trainval/wmE8dQcZgB4/50001 WE ALL KNOW YOU CAN'T TAKE THE SQUARE ROOT OF A NEGATIVE
trainval/wMsOYqJ4ShA/50001 AND THIS IS TRUE FOR EVERY SINGLE CANCER
trainval/Wn1imxwGscs/50001 HAVE ANY OF YOU EVER HAD A CHALLENGE THAT'S SO GREAT THAT YOU KNEW THERE WAS NO WAY YOU COULD ACCOMPLISH IT ON YOUR OWN
trainval/Wn1imxwGscs/50002 BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT I WANT TO KIND OF GET YOU UP TO SPEED ON WHAT WE ACTUALLY DID THIS PAST SUMMER
trainval/Wn1imxwGscs/50003 THERE IS A CATHEDRAL THAT WE ENDED AT
trainval/Wn1imxwGscs/50004 WHO KNOWS WHY THESE PEOPLE DID WHAT THEY DID TO HELP ME
trainval/Wn1imxwGscs/50005 SO I WON'T SAY THAT WE WERE COCKY WE WERE FEELING REALLY CONFIDENT BECAUSE WE'D JUST COME OVER THE PYRENEES
trainval/Wn1imxwGscs/50006 AND THEY SAID WE'RE WAITING FOR JUSTIN HE'S IN A WHEELCHAIR WE WANT TO GET HIM OVER THIS MOUNTAIN PASS
trainval/Wn1imxwGscs/50007 AND THEY SAID ALL RIGHT WE'LL STOP
trainval/Wn1imxwGscs/50008 AND SOME LIVES TRIUMPH IN THE FACE OF THAT ADVERSITY AND SOME LIVES DON'T
trainval/wN3ovSzal3g/50001 AND WE WERE AMONG THE FORTUNATE FEW TO BE ABLE TO BOARD A PLANE ONTO SAFER GROUND
trainval/wN3ovSzal3g/50002 IT MATTERS BECAUSE AS A RESULT OF THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT IN 1948 HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
trainval/wN3ovSzal3g/50003 SO IN IT HE WRITES HI TAMARA HOW ARE YOU
trainval/wN3ovSzal3g/50004 YOUR GRANDFATHER BUILT IT AS THE FIRST HOUSE IN NORTH ALNUZHA
trainval/wn8S33NBB04/50001 NOT ONLY WORLDWIDE BUT JUST HERE IN THE UNITED STATES
trainval/wn8S33NBB04/50002 AND PERHAPS EVEN MORE DISTURBING THE EQUIVALENT OF THE UNDERGRADUATE POPULATION HERE AT UNIVERSITY PARK
trainval/wn8S33NBB04/50003 AND THINK ABOUT THAT IT'S NOT JUST THE FRESHMAN NOT JUST THE SOPHOMORES AND NOT JUST ONE YEAR BUT
trainval/wn8S33NBB04/50004 SO FOR EXAMPLE A BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION FOR SMOKING CESSATION MIGHT INCLUDE PRE CESSATION
trainval/wn8S33NBB04/50005 SUPERVISED PRACTICE QUIT ATTEMPTS SO THAT THE PERSON WILL HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT IT'S LIKE WHEN THEY QUIT SMOKING FOR REAL
trainval/wn8S33NBB04/50006 COUNSELING OFFERED ACROSS THE ENTIRE QUITTING PROCESS IN PERSON AND POSSIBLY OVER THE
trainval/wn8S33NBB04/50007 NOW LET'S THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A SECOND
trainval/wn8S33NBB04/50008 ONLY WHEN THEY HAD A SET OF COMPONENTS WHERE THEY UNDERSTOOD THE OPERATION OF THE COMPONENTS REALLY WELL THEY WERE
trainval/wn8S33NBB04/50009 DID ANY OF THOSE PROTOTYPE SPACECRAFT FAIL
trainval/wn8S33NBB04/50010 BECAUSE I REMEMBER MY FATHER'S REACTION TO THE REPORT
trainval/wn8S33NBB04/50011 WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THAT APPROACH
trainval/wn8S33NBB04/50012 IF IT TURNS OUT THAT THE INTERVENTION THAT THE INTERVENTION FAILED IT DIDN'T WORK WE DON'T KNOW WHY IT DIDN'T WORK
trainval/wn8S33NBB04/50013 AND EITHER WAY WE'RE LEFT WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT ARE THE STEPS WE NEED TO TAKE SO THAT THE NEXT INTERVENTION WE
trainval/wn8S33NBB04/50014 AND YET WE HAVE NOT BEEN WORKING PROGRAMMATICALLY TOWARD BETTER AND BETTER AND BETTER BEHAVIORAL
trainval/wn8S33NBB04/50015 WHAT IF WE STARTED USING ENGINEERING APPROACHES TO DEVELOP BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS
trainval/wn8S33NBB04/50016 HE QUIT SMOKING AS A RESULT OF READING THAT REPORT AND SO DID MANY OTHER PEOPLE
trainval/wn8S33NBB04/50017 THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW OF COURSE MANY FEWER PEOPLE SMOKE
trainval/wn8S33NBB04/50018 OUR HOPE IS THAT AFTER WE'VE DEVELOPED THIS BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION THE WORK OF OTHERS AND POSSIBLY OUR FUTURE
trainval/wn8S33NBB04/50019 OR BETTER IN SOME OTHER INCREMENTAL WAY
trainval/wn8S33NBB04/50020 THE IDEA IS TO JUST TO KEEP GETTING BETTER AND BETTER AND BETTER
trainval/wn8S33NBB04/50021 I THINK WE CAN IF WE TAKE A PAGE FROM NASA'S BOOK AND ENGINEER BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS
trainval/wn8S33NBB04/50022 WE'RE EXAMINING THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE 15 COMPONENTS IN A SET OF 3
trainval/wn8S33NBB04/50023 THESE EXPERIMENTS ARE TAKING PLACE IN ORDINARY HEALTHCARE SETTINGS WHERE YOU MIGHT GO IF YOU NEEDED A ROUTINE
trainval/wn8S33NBB04/50024 WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF ANALYZING IT NOW
trainval/WNDWYW4yWEM/50001 WAIT FOR THE GO
trainval/WNDWYW4yWEM/50002 LITTLE LARVAE HATCH OUT IN FRESH WATER
trainval/WNDWYW4yWEM/50003 THEY FEED ON OTHER LITTLE THINGS
trainval/WNDWYW4yWEM/50005 IT'S QUITE INCREDIBLE
trainval/WNDWYW4yWEM/50006 WHICH UP UNTIL NOW HAS HAD THE LONGEST KNOWN INSECT MIGRATION
trainval/WNDWYW4yWEM/50007 THEY TRAVEL AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME WITH THE SAME WINDS TO MAKE THE CROSSING
trainval/WNDWYW4yWEM/50008 I KNOW THEY TRAVEL AT THE SAME ALTITUDE
trainval/WNDWYW4yWEM/50009 IT'S KNOWN ABOUT THE AMUR FALCON
trainval/WNDWYW4yWEM/50010 THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEWHERE TO BREED
trainval/WNDWYW4yWEM/50011 AND THE DRAGONFLIES ARE THERE
trainval/WNj1Y11tSx8/50002 UNTIL RECENTLY SLEEP PROBLEMS THAT OCCURRED IN THE CONTEXT OF MAJOR LIFE STRESS OR MEDICAL OR
trainval/WNj1Y11tSx8/50003 WELL THE EVIDENCE IS IN AND THE RESULTS ARE CLEAR
trainval/wNokfBHccVI/50001 THAT WAS THE DAY THAT I SHATTERED THE BALANCE MYTH
trainval/wNokfBHccVI/50002 TO SET YOUR OWN AND TO SET THEM THE WAY THAT YOU WANT
trainval/wNokfBHccVI/50003 SO HOW DO WE GET ALL OF THOSE THINGS DONE
trainval/wOiKRVH0nQ8/50001 YET COMPARATIVELY WE HAVE ABOUT A DOZEN TARGETED MEDICATIONS
trainval/wOiKRVH0nQ8/50002 SO WE DEVELOPED AN IDEA A RATIONALE THAT PERHAPS IF WE MADE A MOLECULE THAT PREVENTED THE POST IT
trainval/wOiKRVH0nQ8/50003 WE THOUGHT WE'D JUST SEND IT TO PEOPLE AND SEE HOW THE MOLECULE BEHAVES
trainval/wOiKRVH0nQ8/50004 WE SENT IT TO OXFORD ENGLAND WHERE A GROUP OF TALENTED CRYSTALLOGRAPHERS PROVIDED THIS PICTURE WHICH HELPED US
trainval/wOiKRVH0nQ8/50005 THE BAR IS CALLED THE MIRACLE OF SCIENCE
trainval/wOiKRVH0nQ8/50006 WELL THEY PROBABLY WOULD KEEP THIS A SECRET UNTIL THEY TURN THE PROTOTYPE DRUG INTO AN ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL
trainval/wOiKRVH0nQ8/50007 SO WE DID JUST THE OPPOSITE
trainval/wOiKRVH0nQ8/50008 AND WE'RE ABLE FINALLY TO ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT'S BEEN SO PRESSING FOR SO MANY YEARS WHY DO I HAVE
trainval/wOiKRVH0nQ8/50009 NOW THE BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVES ALL OF YOU
trainval/wOiKRVH0nQ8/50010 THIS RESEARCH IS FUNDED BY THE PUBLIC
trainval/wOiKRVH0nQ8/50011 AND ONE THING I'VE LEARNED IN BOSTON IS THAT YOU PEOPLE WILL DO ANYTHING FOR CANCER AND I LOVE THAT
trainval/WonC2e5aOGE/50002 A LOT OF PEOPLE IN MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY WERE DYING AND THEY WERE DYING BACK TO BACK TO BACK
trainval/WonC2e5aOGE/50003 AND THEY WEREN'T OLD
trainval/WonC2e5aOGE/50004 SO I WENT BACK TO MY RESEARCH WHICH IS MY SAFE SPACE
trainval/WonC2e5aOGE/50005 AN EVERYDAY DEATH IS WHEN YOU'RE IN A MEETING AND YOUR BOSS CALLS ON YOU TO EXPOUND UPON A POINT MAYBE ON A PROJECT BUT YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
trainval/WonC2e5aOGE/50006 ANOTHER EVERYDAY DEATH IS WHEN YOU GET A REJECTION LETTER THE FIFTH ONE
trainval/WonC2e5aOGE/50007 AND IF WE DON'T MANAGE THESE WELL WE'RE NOT LIVING WELL
trainval/WonC2e5aOGE/50008 SO TWO THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN YOU'RE CONFRONTED WITH YOUR MONSTER
trainval/WonC2e5aOGE/50009 THE SECOND THING THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO RUN
trainval/WonC2e5aOGE/50010 MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST QUIT
trainval/WonC2e5aOGE/50011 ASSUME THE POSITION
trainval/WonC2e5aOGE/50012 YOU'LL WANT TO GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE
trainval/WonC2e5aOGE/50013 I'M THE BOSS
trainval/WonC2e5aOGE/50014 NOW WHY DOES THIS WORK
trainval/WonC2e5aOGE/50015 AND HOW DO WE RUN
trainval/WoS7PGFjwDQ/50001 HELLO GOOD MORNING IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU
trainval/WoS7PGFjwDQ/50002 IT'S ABOUT ONE PERCENT
trainval/WoS7PGFjwDQ/50003 THE PERSPECTIVE IS VERY SIMPLY THIS
trainval/WoS7PGFjwDQ/50004 THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES WELL ALRIGHT HOW ARE WE DOING
trainval/WOxSQHtJWlo/50001 IT IS IF WE'RE PAYING OFF THE GREEK DEBT EVERY YEAR IN THE BURDEN OF ILLNESS PRODUCED BY
trainval/WOxSQHtJWlo/50002 AND ALSO THE RESILIENCE IN THE BRAIN CAN BE IMPAIRED AND THAT WILL LEAD TO DISORDERS
trainval/WOxSQHtJWlo/50003 MODERN NEUROSCIENCE HAS SHOWN THEY WERE RIGHT
trainval/WOxSQHtJWlo/50005 MOST OF OUR GOVERNMENTS PERPETUATE THIS LIE
trainval/WpEjt71l08I/50001 IN 2015 IT HAD DROPPED TO 8
trainval/WpEjt71l08I/50002 25 SECONDS EIGHT AND A QUARTER SECONDS
trainval/WpEjt71l08I/50003 IT'S JUST THE IDEA YOUR BRAIN IS ADAPTABLE IT CAN CHANGE AND REORGANIZE ITSELF
trainval/WpEjt71l08I/50004 BECAUSE YOUR BRAIN IS MADE UP OF AROUND 21 BILLION BRAIN CELLS OR NEURONS AND THEY MAKE ALL SORTS OF
trainval/WpEjt71l08I/50005 THEN MY BRAIN REINFORCES THE CONNECTION OH
trainval/WpEjt71l08I/50006 BUT IF I'M WALKING DOWN THE STREET I WALK PASS SOMEBODY'S HOUSE AND THERE'S THIS ROTTWEILER OUT IN THE FRONT YARD BARKING GROWLING IT'S
trainval/WpEjt71l08I/50007 SO IF I NEED TO KNOW THIS DOCTOR WHO FACTOID OR TIDBIT I CAN ASK BEN AND THE ODDS ARE HE'LL BE ABLE TO TELL ME ABOUT
trainval/WpEjt71l08I/50008 THAT'S THE IDEA BEHIND TRANSACTIVE MEMORY
trainval/WpEjt71l08I/50009 BUT SINCE DIGITAL MEMORY HAS BECOME SO READILY AVAILABLE WE STARTED TO RELY ON COMPUTERS ON THE
trainval/WpEjt71l08I/50010 IF I COPY THAT LIST OF FACTS INTO A COMPUTER FIRST I WILL REMEMBER LESS OF THEM BECAUSE BY
trainval/WpEjt71l08I/50011 THE WHOLE REASON I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU THIS SHARING THIS INFORMATION WITH YOU TELLING YOU HOW AND WHY
trainval/WpEjt71l08I/50012 BECAUSE ONCE YOU ACCEPT THAT KNOWLEDGE YOU CAN START TO ASK YOURSELF QUESTIONS SAY THINGS TO YOURSELF LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/WpEjt71l08I/50013 EVEN IF THE GOING GETS TOUGH OR WEIRD OR SCARY DON'T PANIC AND JUST KEEP SWIMMING
trainval/WpEjt71l08I/50014 I'LL EMBRACE THAT SHORT ATTENTION SPAN AND BECOME THIS MULTI TASKING MACHINE
trainval/WpEjt71l08I/50015 THAT'S A PERFECTLY VALID OPTION
trainval/WpEjt71l08I/50016 BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY YOU'VE CHOSEN WHICH PATH YOU WANTED TO PURSUE
trainval/WpEjt71l08I/50017 YOU ARE ALL LIKE DORY
trainval/wPFA8n7goio/50001 AND IF YOU CLOSED YOUR EYES YOU'D BE ABLE TO MENTALLY NAVIGATE IT
trainval/wPFA8n7goio/50002 NO POWERPOINT IS USED IN TWO DAYS
trainval/wPFA8n7goio/50003 BUT INSTEAD THE ENTIRE TEAM CREATES A SHARED MENTAL MODEL THAT THEY CAN ALL AGREE ON AND MOVE
trainval/wPFA8n7goio/50004 AND I BELIEVE THAT THESE THREE PRINCIPLES CAN BE APPLIED TO SOLVING SOME OF THE VERY TOUGH PROBLEMS THAT WE
trainval/WpldYJ3sSIo/50001 I'M GOING TO START WITH AN EXAMPLE FROM SOME WORK THAT WE DID ON NEWBORN HEALTH
trainval/WpldYJ3sSIo/50002 SO HERE'S A PROBLEM FOUR MILLION BABIES AROUND THE WORLD MOSTLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
trainval/WpldYJ3sSIo/50003 IT TURNS OUT HALF OF THOSE KIDS OR ABOUT 1
trainval/WpldYJ3sSIo/50004 IT'S FANTASTIC IT'S GOING TO BLOW YOUR MIND
trainval/WpldYJ3sSIo/50005 PROBABLY WHAT HAPPENED IS A HOSPITAL IN JAPAN UPGRADED THEIR EQUIPMENT AND DONATED THEIR OLD STUFF TO NEPAL
trainval/WpldYJ3sSIo/50006 SO WE GOT STARTED
trainval/WpldYJ3sSIo/50007 SO WE STARTED WITH THEM SAYING WELL WHAT DO YOU WANT
trainval/WpldYJ3sSIo/50008 WHAT'S A PROBLEM YOU WANT TO SOLVE
trainval/WpldYJ3sSIo/50009 THERE'S ONE WAY TO TREAT JAUNDICE AND THAT'S WHAT'S CALLED AN EXCHANGE TRANSFUSION
trainval/WpldYJ3sSIo/50010 FROM A PHOTOTHERAPY STANDPOINT MAYBE NOT THE BEST BEHAVIOR
trainval/WpldYJ3sSIo/50011 WE DECIDED WE CAN'T PUT A DO NOT ENTER SIGN NEXT TO THE VENT
trainval/WpldYJ3sSIo/50014 ARE WE DESIGNING FOR THE WORLD THAT WE WANT
trainval/WpldYJ3sSIo/50015 ARE WE DESIGNING FOR THE WORLD THAT'S COMING WHETHER WE'RE READY OR NOT
trainval/WpldYJ3sSIo/50016 I'VE SINCE LEARNED THAT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD YOU HAVE TO DESIGN OUTCOMES
trainval/wQ0NNmo42SA/50001 I'VE BEEN USING IT FOR A WHILE AND I'M USED TO IT
trainval/WQ2PFoHptK8/50001 ALL OF OUR STATUSES ARE DIFFERENT
trainval/WQ2PFoHptK8/50002 ALL OF OUR HOPES AND DREAMS WHAT WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH IS DIFFERENT AND OUR PATHS WILL BE DIFFERENT THEY ARE ALL STORIES
trainval/WQ2PFoHptK8/50003 WE WERE AT THE BEACH HE WAS RAISING HIS SON AND HE WAS PRODUCTIVE
trainval/WQ2PFoHptK8/50004 I MEAN I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO HIM
trainval/WQ2PFoHptK8/50005 SO WE WENT TO THE FINANCE INDUSTRY
trainval/WQ2PFoHptK8/50006 CAN WE DO THE EVEN HARDER THING
trainval/WQ2PFoHptK8/50007 SO THANK YOU
trainval/WQ82Uukl6rg/50001 I IMAGINE MOST OF THE PEOPLE SITTING IN THIS ROOM SPENT MOST OF THEIR TIME WHEN THEY WERE IN MIDDLE SCHOOL
trainval/WQ82Uukl6rg/50002 WHY ARE WE SURPRISED WHEN SO MANY STUDENTS DROP OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL
trainval/WQ82Uukl6rg/50003 HE WAS JUST BEING WHAT I WAS
trainval/WQ82Uukl6rg/50004 THAT'S ALL IT IS
trainval/WQ82Uukl6rg/50005 THAT'S WHAT I AM
trainval/WQ82Uukl6rg/50006 AND IT'S GREAT
trainval/WQG8EJTY48M/50001 THAT WAS MY AHA
trainval/WQG8EJTY48M/50002 I CREATED MY OWN STORY
trainval/WQG8EJTY48M/50003 WE'RE GOING TO RECREATE THIS STORY
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50001 WHETHER THIS IS A PERSONAL DECISION WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO INSTALL A BURGLAR ALARM IN YOUR HOME OR A NATIONAL DECISION WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO INVADE
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50002 YOU'VE HEARD IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THE WORLD IS SAFER BECAUSE SADDAM HUSSEIN IS NOT IN POWER
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50003 THAT MIGHT BE TRUE BUT IT'S NOT TERRIBLY RELEVANT
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50004 THE QUESTION IS WAS IT WORTH IT
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50005 THAT'S HOW YOU THINK ABOUT SECURITY IN TERMS OF THE TRADE OFF
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50006 NOW THERE'S OFTEN NO RIGHT OR WRONG HERE
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50007 AND IT'LL DEPEND ON WHERE WE LIVE WHETHER WE LIVE ALONE OR HAVE A FAMILY HOW MUCH COOL STUFF WE HAVE
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50008 A LOT OF TIMES THESE TRADE OFFS ARE ABOUT MORE THAN JUST SECURITY AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50009 NOW PEOPLE HAVE A NATURAL INTUITION ABOUT THESE TRADE OFFS
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50010 WE MAKE THEM EVERY DAY
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50012 I'LL GIVE YOU THE SHORT ANSWER
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50013 A LOT OF GOOD EXPERIMENTS IN THIS
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50014 REALLY WE HAVE TWO SEPARATE CONCEPTS MAPPED ONTO THE SAME WORD
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50015 I TELL PEOPLE IF IT'S IN THE NEWS DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT BECAUSE BY DEFINITION NEWS IS SOMETHING THAT ALMOST
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50016 AND LANGUAGE IS ACTUALLY A PROBLEM HERE
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50017 AND THERE'S SOME BASIC INNUMERACY GOING ON
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50018 I MEAN THE JOKE ONE TWO THREE MANY IS KIND OF RIGHT
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50019 ONE MANGO TWO MANGOES THREE MANGOES 10000 MANGOES 100000 MANGOES IT'S STILL MORE MANGOES YOU CAN EAT
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50020 AND THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO DO THIS
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50021 ONE YOU CAN MAKE PEOPLE ACTUALLY SECURE AND HOPE THEY NOTICE
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50023 THERE AREN'T ENOUGH EXAMPLES OF FAILURES
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50024 THIS MODEL IS AN INTELLIGENT REPRESENTATION OF REALITY
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50025 MODELS CAN COME FROM INDUSTRY
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50026 THINK OF CANCER BIRD FLU SWINE FLU SARS
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50027 IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE RISKS YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE COSTS YOU'RE LIKELY TO GET THE TRADE OFF WRONG AND YOUR
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50029 AND I CALL THAT THEIR AGENDA
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50030 COMPARE THAT TO THE SECONDHAND SMOKE DEBATE PROBABLY ABOUT 20 YEARS BEHIND
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50031 ALL EXAMPLES OF MODELS CHANGING
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50032 MODELS ARE HARD TO DISLODGE
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50033 SO EVIDENCE AGAINST OUR MODEL WE'RE LIKELY TO IGNORE EVEN IF IT'S COMPELLING
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50034 STRONG FEELINGS CAN CREATE A MODEL
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50035 AND WE RELY ON OTHERS
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50036 WE RELY ON PROXIES
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50037 IT HAS TO GET VERY COMPELLING BEFORE WE'LL PAY ATTENTION
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50038 IT'S A MODEL WE JUST ACCEPT PRETTY MUCH BY FAITH
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50039 AND THAT'S OK
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50040 IT ACTUALLY DOES
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50041 WE LIVE IN A TECHNOLOGICAL WORLD REALITY CHANGES ALL THE TIME
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50042 WE DON'T KNOW
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50043 1982 I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE WILL REMEMBER THIS THERE WAS A SHORT EPIDEMIC OF TYLENOL POISONINGS IN THE
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50044 IT'S A HORRIFIC STORY
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50045 WE'RE TERRIBLE AT MODELS THAT SPAN 80 YEARS
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50046 THOSE TAMPER PROOF CAPS
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50047 THAT CAME FROM THIS
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50048 I'LL GIVE YOU ONE A SYRINGE
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50049 BUT IT MADE PEOPLE FEEL BETTER
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50050 I VISIT HER IN THE HOSPITAL
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50051 I GO HOME I LOOK IT UP
trainval/wQJC2MMB8nA/50052 IT BASICALLY NEVER HAPPENS
trainval/WruaJOkaXCU/50001 BUT HERE'S WHAT I WOULDN'T TELL THEM
trainval/wSepGxx36To/50001 WITHOUT STUDENT LOANS MANY STUDENTS MANY STUDENTS WOULD BE LOCKED OUT OF HIGHER ED ENTIRELY
trainval/wSepGxx36To/50002 COLLEGE IS EXPENSIVE
trainval/wSepGxx36To/50003 AND ULTIMATELY THE GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD GO INTO A TAILSPIN
trainval/wSepGxx36To/50004 WE GOT TO HAVE SOME SKIN IN THIS GAME
trainval/wSepGxx36To/50005 THE PERCENTAGE COULD BE EQUAL TO THAT COLLEGE'S THREE YEAR COHORT DEFAULT RATE AS PUBLISHED BY THE
trainval/wSepGxx36To/50006 THAT WAY THE OVERALL PENALTY THAT INSTITUTIONS WOULD PAY SCALES ROUGHLY
trainval/wSepGxx36To/50007 THAT'S A SUBTLE POINT
trainval/wSepGxx36To/50008 AND IT'S GETTING MORE EXPENSIVE EVERY YEAR
trainval/wSepGxx36To/50009 BUT THOSE THAT DON'T WILL PAY MUCH MUCH MORE
trainval/wSepGxx36To/50010 BUT SOME INSTITUTIONS WOULD SHARE MUCH MORE PAIN THAN OTHERS
trainval/wSepGxx36To/50011 NOW THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME STRONG SUPPORT FOR THIS IDEA
trainval/wSepGxx36To/50012 BUT THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE
trainval/wSepGxx36To/50013 AS STATE GOVERNMENTS STRUGGLE TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGETS STUDENTS ARE PICKING UP A LARGER SHARE OF THE TOTAL
trainval/wSepGxx36To/50014 WELL SENATOR RICHARD DURBAN PUTS IT THIS WAY
trainval/wSepGxx36To/50015 YOU REALLY ONLY HAVE TO KNOW THREE NUMBERS TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF FOR PROFITS IN THIS MESS
trainval/wSepGxx36To/50016 BUT OTHER COLLEGES MOST OTHERS WOULD DO THINGS LIKE STRETCHING OUT LOAN ELIGIBILITY FOR STUDENTS
trainval/wSepGxx36To/50017 IT'S A ONE FOLLOWED BY TWELVE ZEROS
trainval/wSepGxx36To/50018 MY NAME IS CHUCK WHITE AND I SERVE AS PRESIDENT OF WEBER STATE UNIVERSITY IN OGDEN UTAH
trainval/wSF82AwSDiU/50001 THIS IS KNOWN AS THE COOLIDGE EFFECT
trainval/wSF82AwSDiU/50002 WHY IS THAT
trainval/wSF82AwSDiU/50003 WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE WHEN SCIENTIST EXAMINED FORMER INTERNET ADDICTS THEY FOUND THAT
trainval/wSHYZv6HzAs/50001 ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT MAKE ME WHO I AM
trainval/wSHYZv6HzAs/50002 REALLY NOT TRUE
trainval/wSHYZv6HzAs/50003 HEY THIS PLANE IS GOING DOWN WHO CAN FLY
trainval/wSHYZv6HzAs/50004 PUT YOUR HAND UP
trainval/wSHYZv6HzAs/50005 I CAN I'M CONFIDENT
trainval/wSHYZv6HzAs/50006 THERE'S NO MAGIC BUTTON
trainval/wSHYZv6HzAs/50007 AFTER SIX OR SEVEN I'M LIKE
trainval/wsIrdxDJpSQ/50001 IT HAS HALF THE CO2 EMISSIONS AND IT DOESN'T COME WITH THE TOXIC BYPRODUCTS THAT ARE FOUND IN COAL
trainval/wsIrdxDJpSQ/50002 SAPO 34 IS VERY STABLE
trainval/wsIrdxDJpSQ/50003 IT CAN FUNCTION UNDER A WIDE RANGE OF PRESSURES AND IT CAN TAKE TEMPERATURES UP TO 700
trainval/wsIrdxDJpSQ/50004 50 MIXTURE OF CO2 TO METHANE INTO A 1
trainval/wsIrdxDJpSQ/50005 99 MIXTURE OF CO2 TO METHANE OR BETTER AND
trainval/wsIrdxDJpSQ/50006 WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS BY INCREASING THE LENGTH OF OUR MEMBRANES AND ADDING IN MULTIPLE CHANNELS
trainval/WSKPrVG3Evs/50001 IMAGINE YOU WERE IN THAT EVENT HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IN THAT EVENT
trainval/WSKPrVG3Evs/50002 I DO THAT ALL THE TIME I'M A MIMIC
trainval/WSKPrVG3Evs/50003 AND JUST WHAT AMOUNT OF ENERGY COULD ACTUALLY BE UNLEASHED AS A RESULT OF THAT
trainval/WSKPrVG3Evs/50004 WE CAN'T SCRIPT THAT
trainval/WSKPrVG3Evs/50005 HOW WILL THEY BOUNCE OFF THAT
trainval/WSKPrVG3Evs/50006 ANOTHER STUDENT MIGHT SAY
trainval/WSKPrVG3Evs/50007 NO I DON'T WANT TO GO THAT DIRECTION
trainval/WSKPrVG3Evs/50008 WINSTON CHURCHILL SAID
trainval/WSKPrVG3Evs/50009 IF YOU'RE ENGAGING ON TWITTER INFORMATION IS SWIRLING AROUND IN THIS SPACE VIA
trainval/WSKPrVG3Evs/50010 WHAT PERMISSIONS WILL WE GIVE YOU
trainval/WSKPrVG3Evs/50011 DO YOU NEED TO ASK PERMISSION TO TALK
trainval/WSKPrVG3Evs/50012 AND YEAH IT'S PRIVATE I CAN'T GET INTO YOUR HEAD YOU CAN'T GET INTO MINE
trainval/WsmVX5C1HXY/50001 CHANGE THE WORK WEEK
trainval/WSsjBMSWSYE/50003 THE PROJECT AIM IS REALLY QUITE SIMPLE
trainval/WSsjBMSWSYE/50007 FOUR AND A HALF HOURS ON THE TABLE AND EVERYTHING WAS DONE
trainval/WSsjBMSWSYE/50008 WE DON'T NEED ANY OF THAT
trainval/WSsjBMSWSYE/50009 HE OPENS YOU UP HE ACCESSES THE AORTA WHILE YOUR HEART IS BEATING ALL AT THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE
trainval/WSsjBMSWSYE/50010 SO IT REALLY IS GREAT
trainval/WSsjBMSWSYE/50011 WELL THE ANSWER TO THAT IS A MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM
trainval/WSsjBMSWSYE/50013 WE HAD TO GET GOOD QUALITY IMAGES FROM WHICH TO MAKE THE CAD MODEL
trainval/WSsjBMSWSYE/50014 SO ONE NEEDS TO BE CAREFUL WITH DISCIPLINARY CONVENTIONS
trainval/WSsjBMSWSYE/50016 BECAUSE HE IS SO SUCCESSFUL
trainval/WSsjBMSWSYE/50017 YOU HAVE AN EQUIVALENT IN POLAND NO DOUBT
trainval/WSsjBMSWSYE/50018 THEY'VE REALLY GOT TO START TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND EXERCISE A BIT OF IMAGINATION IF THAT'S NOT TOO MUCH TO ASK
trainval/wstksuaSMD4/50001 HE HAD A LOVELY SENSE OF HUMOR TOO
trainval/WtLMST8TyeY/50001 WE HAVE THESE GREAT NEW PARTNERS IN OUR DREAM FOR A BRIGHTER FUTURE
trainval/WtLMST8TyeY/50002 THINK OF THINGS THAT COULD BE AT RISK OF DYING OUT LIKE SMALL AGRICULTURE OR SKILLED TRADES
trainval/WtLMST8TyeY/50003 THAT'S THREE TIMES AS MANY AS NEW YORK CITY TAKES
trainval/Wtp7R97jz5k/50001 AROUND THE WORLD WE'RE SPENDING ABOUT A QUARTER OF A TRILLION DOLLARS EVERY YEAR ON BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH A QUARTER
trainval/Wtp7R97jz5k/50002 THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY
trainval/Wtp7R97jz5k/50003 DO YOU REALIZE IT'S BEEN 200 YEARS SINCE PARKINSON DESCRIBED THE DISEASE NAMED AFTER HIM
trainval/Wtp7R97jz5k/50004 WE STILL REALLY DON'T HAVE AN IDEA ABOUT WHAT CAUSES IT
trainval/Wtp7R97jz5k/50005 AND MAYBE WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT MAKING SOME DISCOVERY THAT HELPS ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIG PROBLEMS LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE
trainval/Wtp7R97jz5k/50006 AND IT'S THE SYSTEM THAT JUST HAS TO CHANGE
trainval/Wtp7R97jz5k/50007 WE NEED TO REMEMBER WHAT PASTEUR SAID MORE THAN A CENTURY AGO
trainval/Wtp7R97jz5k/50008 WE USE THE SAME INCENTIVE SYSTEM THE SAME SYSTEM OF SCIENCE AS ALL AROUND THE WORLD
trainval/Wtp7R97jz5k/50009 AND WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT ANY INDIVIDUAL LIKE ME
trainval/Wtp7R97jz5k/50010 I'M AN IRRELEVANT COG IN THE MACHINE
trainval/Wtp7R97jz5k/50011 ANY EXPERIMENT THAT'S BEEN DONE HERE IN CANADA IS LIKELY TAKING PLACE IN TEN OTHER PLACES AROUND THE WORLD AT
trainval/Wtp7R97jz5k/50012 AND THAT QUARTER OF A TRILLION DOLLARS I TOLD YOU ABOUT IF WE KEEP DIVIDING IT UP BY COUNTRY AND
trainval/Wtp7R97jz5k/50013 IN AN OPEN SCIENCE WORLD IF CANADIAN SCIENTISTS WORK IN A CERTAIN AREA AND LET THE WORLD KNOW THEN OTHER PEOPLE AROUND THE
trainval/Wtp7R97jz5k/50014 PROJECTS LIKE THE ALLAN INSTITUTE IN SEATTLE WHOSE MAPPING OF THE BRAIN IS BEING SHARED WITH THE
trainval/Wtp7R97jz5k/50015 AND DOES IT DELIVER
trainval/Wtp7R97jz5k/50016 ACADEMICS HAVE USED OUR REAGENTS TO MAKE BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERIES IN CANCERS THAT ARE
trainval/Wtp7R97jz5k/50017 WE NEED YOUR HELP
trainval/wtvhqeVoeqI/50001 THIS IS THE HEAD IN HANDS MOMENT
trainval/wUKAVcj9NVA/50001 AND THIS IS A GREAT AND NECESSARY THING BUT MOST OF THAT ATTENTION HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON A VERY FEW
trainval/wUKAVcj9NVA/50002 WE NEED CLEAN WATER TO DRINK
trainval/wUKAVcj9NVA/50003 AND MEANWHILE OUR TRANS CHILDREN SUFFER
trainval/wUKAVcj9NVA/50004 ONE TIME I ASKED HER WHAT HER FAVORITE COLOR WAS
trainval/wUKAVcj9NVA/50005 WE NEED SHELTER AND LOVE
trainval/wVGjQSnLg4Y/50001 AND THAT HAS TO HAPPEN WITH BIOTECH
trainval/wvIOoxPxpfQ/50001 IT IS CAUSING CASES OF CHOLERA TO RISE
trainval/wvIOoxPxpfQ/50002 A WARMER CLIMATE MEANS THESE STORMS ARE BECOMING MORE INTENSE AND MORE LONG LIVED
trainval/wvIOoxPxpfQ/50003 OUR COASTLINES THEY'RE OUR FAVORITE PLACE TO LIVE WE'VE DESTROYED A LOT OF THESE HABITATS
trainval/wvIOoxPxpfQ/50004 THE SEA LEVEL IS RISING AND THERE IS VERY LITTLE ROOM FOR THESE HABITATS TO RETREAT TO
trainval/wvIOoxPxpfQ/50005 WHAT CAN I DO
trainval/WvvuLDX7iIk/50001 WHAT ABOUT THE LATE 1940S WHEN THE AUTOMOBILE BECAME VERY POPULAR AND WE SUDDENLY HAD
trainval/WvvuLDX7iIk/50002 I THEN PUT THAT QUESTIONNAIRE ON VARIOUS DATING SITES IN 40
trainval/WvvuLDX7iIk/50003 MEN'S JOBS BECAME MORE IMPORTANT THEY HAD TO MOVE THE ROCKS FELL THE TREES PLOW THE LAND
trainval/WvvuLDX7iIk/50004 AND IN FACT IN MY STUDIES OF 5000 PEOPLE EVERY YEAR I ASK THEM WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR
trainval/ww4kNxYE0c4/50001 IT WAS ALL I COULD DO TO HOLD ONTO THIS AMAZING CREATURE
trainval/ww4kNxYE0c4/50002 THEN IT SORT OF CALMED DOWN IN THE PALMS OF MY HANDS AND STARTED FLASHING COLORS JUST PULSING ALL OF THESE COLORS
trainval/ww4kNxYE0c4/50003 AND THE AQUARIUM HAD A LOT OF BIG FISH TANKS BUT NOT A LOT OF INVERTEBRATE DISPLAYS AND BEING THE SPINELESS GUY I
trainval/ww4kNxYE0c4/50004 AND THEN I REALIZE THE OCTOPUS WON THE ARMS RACE {LG}
trainval/ww4kNxYE0c4/50005 A MAN CAME INTO THE AQUARIUM
trainval/ww4kNxYE0c4/50006 MAYBE I CAN DO THIS ALL THE TIME
trainval/ww4kNxYE0c4/50007 YEAH I'LL BE A FILMMAKER
trainval/ww4kNxYE0c4/50008 AND WHAT I LEARNED IN SCHOOL THOUGH WAS REALLY BENEFICIAL
trainval/ww4kNxYE0c4/50009 DOWN YOU GO
trainval/ww4kNxYE0c4/50010 I'VE BEEN TO A PLACE THAT WAS A PRETTY TRASHED BAY
trainval/ww4kNxYE0c4/50011 I THINK MARGARET MEAD SAID IT BEST
trainval/ww4kNxYE0c4/50012 INDEED IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT EVER HAS
trainval/ww4kNxYE0c4/50013 AND I APPLAUD THAT
trainval/wWLf4u2xJVM/50001 WE NOW STAND ON THE VERGE OF ANOTHER REVOLUTION IN GEOLOCATION ACCURACY
trainval/WWloIAQpMcQ/50001 THIS WILL PROBABLY MAKE YOU FEEL A LITTLE BIT ANXIOUS AND YOU'LL PROBABLY WANT TO START RUNNING
trainval/WWloIAQpMcQ/50002 THIS ANXIOUS FEELING THAT YOU GET IS GOOD BECAUSE IT PROTECTS YOU IT
trainval/WWloIAQpMcQ/50003 I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN
trainval/WWloIAQpMcQ/50004 IT TOOK THE ANXIETY OUT OF EVERYTHING AND REPLACED IT WITH EXCITEMENT
trainval/WWloIAQpMcQ/50005 THE REASON WHY THIS WORKS SO WELL IS THAT IT SPEEDS UP YOUR DECISION MAKING AND CATAPULTS YOU
trainval/WWloIAQpMcQ/50006 DO IT BADLY FREES YOU UP TO TAKE ACTION
trainval/wX78iKhInsc/50001 YOU SEE IN THE END EDUCATION IS ABOUT LEARNING
trainval/wX78iKhInsc/50002 I'VE TRAVELED THE WHOLE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF THIS COUNTRY
trainval/wX78iKhInsc/50003 ECONOMY OVER 10 YEARS OF NEARLY A TRILLION DOLLARS
trainval/wX78iKhInsc/50004 I'M NOT HERE TO ARGUE AGAINST SCIENCE AND MATH
trainval/wX78iKhInsc/50005 CHILDREN ARE NATURAL LEARNERS
trainval/wX78iKhInsc/50006 IT'S LIKE PEOPLE ARE SAILING INTO A HEADWIND ALL THE TIME
trainval/wX78iKhInsc/50007 IT SHOULDN'T OBSTRUCT IT WHICH OF COURSE IT OFTEN DOES
trainval/wX78iKhInsc/50008 AND THE THIRD PRINCIPLE IS THIS THAT HUMAN LIFE IS INHERENTLY CREATIVE
trainval/wX78iKhInsc/50009 IT'S WHY WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT R SUM S
trainval/wX78iKhInsc/50010 IT'S THE COMMON CURRENCY OF BEING A HUMAN BEING
trainval/wX78iKhInsc/50011 IT'S WHY HUMAN CULTURE IS SO INTERESTING AND DIVERSE AND DYNAMIC
trainval/wX78iKhInsc/50012 NO I'M FINE
trainval/wX78iKhInsc/50013 THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS OF THE TEST
trainval/wX78iKhInsc/50015 THEY RECOGNIZE THAT YOU CAN'T IMPROVE EDUCATION IF YOU DON'T PICK GREAT PEOPLE TO TEACH AND KEEP GIVING THEM CONSTANT
trainval/wX78iKhInsc/50016 NOTHING GROWS THERE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T RAIN
trainval/wX78iKhInsc/50017 CULTURE IS AN ORGANIC TERM ISN'T IT
trainval/wxCtIdI3xL0/50001 THERE IS NO LIFE POSSIBLE AT THE SURFACE OF MARS TODAY BUT IT MIGHT STILL BE HIDING UNDERGROUND
trainval/wxCtIdI3xL0/50002 MARS MAY HOLD THAT SECRET FOR US
trainval/WXOd4qh3JKk/50001 I WOULD ALSO SAY
trainval/WXqjacxw8zg/50001 OR YOU OPEN OUR POST BOX AND YOU FIND PILES OF ADVERTISEMENTS WE CALL THAT JUNK
trainval/WXqjacxw8zg/50002 AND I VE BEEN TRULY HONORED TO CO LEAD THIS CONSORTIUM TOGETHER WITH DRS
trainval/WxUf326kZ1I/50001 THEY HADN'T FOUND THE SAUCE YET
trainval/wYCSHKl4RPU/50001 THIS IS HOW SCIENCE LEARNS
trainval/wYCSHKl4RPU/50002 SARCOMA IS A VERY RARE FORM OF CANCER
trainval/wYCSHKl4RPU/50003 REMEMBER THAT A ONE IN A MILLION DIAGNOSIS IF IT HAPPENS TWICE IN ONE FAMILY IS
trainval/wyhF7q3Sbpk/50001 BUT THEY'RE NOT
trainval/wz0mlDELSo0/50001 AND THEY ARE SO COOL THAT THEY HAVE EVEN DEVELOPED A HAND SIGN
trainval/wZ2TF8SPGQ4/50001 THE REASON IS THAT SOMETIMES IT'S THE CHEAPEST SAFEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE TECHNOLOGY
trainval/wZ2TF8SPGQ4/50002 THERE'S NO CONVENTIONAL METHOD
trainval/wZ2TF8SPGQ4/50003 BUT THIS APPROACH DOES NOT WORK WELL IN BANGLADESH
trainval/wZ2TF8SPGQ4/50004 THAT'S BECAUSE THESE INSECTICIDE SPRAYS ARE DIFFICULT TO FIND THEY'RE EXPENSIVE AND THEY DON'T PREVENT THE INSECT
trainval/wZ2TF8SPGQ4/50005 MORE THAN HALF WILL DIE
trainval/wZ2TF8SPGQ4/50006 THESE ARE PRECISELY THE SAME ORGANIZATIONS THAT MOST OF US TRUST WHEN IT COMES TO OTHER IMPORTANT SCIENTIFIC
trainval/wZ2TF8SPGQ4/50007 LET'S CELEBRATE SCIENTIFIC INNOVATION AND USE IT
trainval/wZ2TF8SPGQ4/50008 FARMERS THERE CANNOT AFFORD THE SEED
trainval/wZ2TF8SPGQ4/50009 THESE SEEDS ARE NOT BEING SOLD
trainval/wZ2TF8SPGQ4/50010 THIS IS THE HEROIN STRATEGY
trainval/wZ2TF8SPGQ4/50011 THERE'S NO ORGANIC METHOD
trainval/wZ2TF8SPGQ4/50012 FOR EXAMPLE THE SEED THAT'S BEING DISTRIBUTED THE FLOOD TOLERANT RICE THIS IS DISTRIBUTED FREELY
trainval/WzDygsn0Djs/50001 WE HAVE BELIEFS ABOUT WHAT SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE CAN BE TRUSTED
trainval/WzDygsn0Djs/50002 AND WE HAVE BELIEFS ABOUT RELIGIOUS SPIRITUAL AND SUPERNATURAL REALITIES
trainval/WzDygsn0Djs/50003 SO YOU MAY FOR EXAMPLE SEE ANOTHER PERSON IN TERMS OF THE CONSTRUCTS A MAN OR WOMAN
trainval/WzDygsn0Djs/50004 AND WHILE IT IS TRUE I BELIEVE THAT MOST PERSONS DO NOT HAVE AN ARTICULATE AND ORGANIZED PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE EVERYONE
trainval/WzDygsn0Djs/50005 THEY'RE SO BASIC TO OUR THINKING THAT THEY BECOME INVISIBLE TO US THEY PRESENT THEMSELVES AS THE OBVIOUS TRUTHS
trainval/WzDygsn0Djs/50006 WE USE THEM TO THINK PERCEIVE AND ACT IN A LARGELY HABITUAL AND UNCONSCIOUS WAY BUT WE RARELY REFLECT UPON THEM
trainval/WzDygsn0Djs/50007 THEY SEE THE WORLD MORE IN TERMS OF GOOD VERSUS EVIL US VERSUS THEM
trainval/WzDygsn0Djs/50008 WE EVEN SHIFT THEM AWAY FROM PERSONS WHO WE DISLIKE
trainval/WzDygsn0Djs/50009 SO WE GROUP TOGETHER INTO RELIGIONS POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES COMMUNITIES MOVEMENTS NATIONS AND SO ON
trainval/WzDygsn0Djs/50010 IF YOU VOTED FOR RIGHT WING PARTY YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENDORSE THE NORMATIVISTIC PERSPECTIVE OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH
trainval/WzDygsn0Djs/50011 SO THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING A POLITICAL DEBATE OR READING A POLITICAL ARTICLE
trainval/WzDygsn0Djs/50012 WE CHEER FOR OUR FAVORITE TEAM WE APPLAUD WHEN IT SCORES WE SUPPORT OUR TEAMMATES AND WE MAKE
trainval/WzDygsn0Djs/50014 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY THE PERSONALITY PSYCHOLOGIST SILVAN TOMKINS
trainval/wznroZvpVHU/50001 THEY WERE NUTS
trainval/wznroZvpVHU/50002 BUT I PUSHED MYSELF
trainval/wznroZvpVHU/50003 A BOOK IS A GIFT YOU CAN OPEN AGAIN AND AGAIN
trainval/wznroZvpVHU/50004 AT THE BOTTOM IS COLOMBIA AND MEXICO WITH 2
trainval/wznroZvpVHU/50005 9 BOOKS READ PER PERSON A YEAR
trainval/wZzHnZzmS58/50001 AND THESE ARE OUR PHOTONS THAT WE USE IN THESE COLOR EXPERIMENTS TO TELEPORT
trainval/X03jYXszD3Q/50001 A TEN MINUTE WALK TOOK ME AN HOUR AND A HALF
trainval/X03jYXszD3Q/50002 CLIMBING UP THE STAIRS TO MY HOUSE 20 MINUTES
trainval/X1DlJpPqDFo/50001 I DOCUMENT WHAT THESE GROUPS DO WHEN THEY'RE NOT SHOOTING
trainval/X1LtIS8VGkk/50001 NOW LET ME EXPLAIN
trainval/X1LtIS8VGkk/50002 AS A PEER MENTOR I WAS ABLE TO SERVE AS A CLASSMATE TO JULIA A SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENT FOR THE
trainval/X1LtIS8VGkk/50003 JULIA AND I WERE EQUALLY OVERWHELMED
trainval/X1LtIS8VGkk/50004 NOW I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING WHERE WAS THE TEACHER
trainval/X1LtIS8VGkk/50005 THE STUDENTS IN THE PEER CONNECTIONS PROGRAM AND SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES DESERVE EQUAL EDUCATION TO
trainval/X2et2KO8gcY/50001 SO WHAT I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT NEXT TIME SOMEBODY WANTS TO MAKE SOME VAST GENERALIZATION ABOUT RELIGION IS THAT MAYBE
trainval/x2sT9KoIISM/50001 THAT MEANS ABOUT 190 MILES PER HOUR
trainval/x2sT9KoIISM/50002 SO NEW THINGS
trainval/x2sT9KoIISM/50003 SO IT'S REALLY A PLAY BETWEEN THESE TWO APPROACHES
trainval/x2sT9KoIISM/50004 SOMETHING THAT I KNOW VERY WELL THESE PRINCIPLES
trainval/x3AwnkR92EA/50001 AND HAVING A PHD IN THE SUBJECT I WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT
trainval/x3AwnkR92EA/50002 OH MY GOD WHERE DO I HAVE TO GO TO BE ABLE TO FLY LIKE A WOMAN AS HIGH AS I WISH
trainval/x3AwnkR92EA/50003 FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE IT PUTS WOMEN AS VICTIM
trainval/x3AwnkR92EA/50004 BUT I THOUGHT
trainval/x3AwnkR92EA/50005 BUT THE WORDS OF MY GRANDMOTHER KEPT COMING BACK TO ME SHE WAS ALWAYS TO SAY
trainval/x3AwnkR92EA/50007 I WANT TO BE LIKE THAT
trainval/x3AwnkR92EA/50008 NOW YOU CLOSE YOUR VAGINA THE GATES ARE CLOSED
trainval/x3AwnkR92EA/50009 WE CAN DO THE WORK BY OURSELVES BUT IT'S MUCH NICER IF YOU ARE WITH US OF COURSE
trainval/X41iulkRqZU/50001 NUMBER TWO ALMOST EVERYTHING WILL WORK AGAIN IF YOU UNPLUG IT FOR A FEW MINUTES {LG}
trainval/X41iulkRqZU/50002 THIS IS THE MOST HORRIBLE TRUTH AND I SO RESENT IT
trainval/X41iulkRqZU/50003 IT'S A HUGE GIFT TO THE WORLD
trainval/X41iulkRqZU/50004 THEY JUST DO IT
trainval/X41iulkRqZU/50005 THEY DO IT BY PREARRANGEMENT WITH THEMSELVES
trainval/X41iulkRqZU/50006 WHEN MY OLDER BROTHER WAS IN FOURTH GRADE HE HAD A TERM PAPER ON BIRDS DUE THE
trainval/X41iulkRqZU/50007 I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
trainval/X41iulkRqZU/50008 THE MOVEMENT OF GRACE IS WHAT CHANGES US HEALS US AND HEALS OUR WORLD
trainval/X41iulkRqZU/50009 A GOOD NAME FOR GOD IS NOT ME
trainval/X41iulkRqZU/50010 MY PASTOR SAID YOU CAN TRAP BEES ON THE BOTTOM OF MASON JARS WITHOUT LIDS BECAUSE THEY DON'T LOOK UP
trainval/X4LOF6ftJVU/50001 SO WE ALREADY HAVE CAMERAS
trainval/X4LOF6ftJVU/50002 YOU HEAR ABOUT PEOPLE WITH GOOGLE GLASS BEING ATTACKED
trainval/X55qpYxwoO4/50002 BUT WE HAD TO COME BACK
trainval/X55qpYxwoO4/50003 AND THEN IT WOULD DISSOLVE
trainval/X55qpYxwoO4/50004 IT BUFFERS THE WATER
trainval/X55qpYxwoO4/50005 NOW THAT WOULD BE USEFUL IF YOU'RE WORKING IN MARITIME INDUSTRY AND YOU'RE TRYING TO PROTECT YOUR
trainval/X55qpYxwoO4/50006 WITH THIS STUFF I CAN MAKE IT DISSOLVE IN ABOUT A WEEK
trainval/X55qpYxwoO4/50007 SO WE'RE ALREADY ABLE TO MANUFACTURE
trainval/x5LshSZn5RA/50001 THESE CORALS DIDN'T STARVE TO DEATH IN MARCH THEY ACTUALLY COOKED
trainval/x5LshSZn5RA/50002 AND WE'VE SEEN CORALS THAT WE WOULD NORMALLY EXPECT TO BE WINNERS DURING A BLEACHING EVENT TO ACTUALLY HAVE
trainval/x5LshSZn5RA/50003 BUT THESE LONGER LIVED CORALS TAKE MUCH MUCH LONGER
trainval/x5LshSZn5RA/50004 SO THERE'S NO TIME TO LOSE
trainval/X5uGLbV5zVo/50001 I OFFERED THE IDEA THAT
trainval/X5uGLbV5zVo/50002 SO WHEN YOU GO TO A BANK DID YOU THINK THAT THE BANK HAD THE MONEY TO LEND YOU WHEN YOU BORROW IT
trainval/X5uGLbV5zVo/50003 IT'S A BARTER ECONOMY
trainval/X5uGLbV5zVo/50004 WE ARE THE WEALTH US
trainval/X6Zo53M0lcY/50001 IT'S NOT AS IF J
trainval/X6Zo53M0lcY/50002 IT'S BASED ON HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF RESEARCH OF PRACTICE
trainval/X6Zo53M0lcY/50003 THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH A TRADITIONAL SCIENTIFIC PAPER
trainval/X6Zo53M0lcY/50004 READING AND WRITING ARE ACTUALLY RELATIVELY RECENT INVENTIONS
trainval/X6Zo53M0lcY/50005 I MEAN THIS IS THE CONNECTIVE TISSUE OF THE HUMAN SUPERORGANISM IN ACTION
trainval/X6Zo53M0lcY/50006 IT'S PROBABLY DRIVEN OUR CULTURE FOR MILLENNIA
trainval/X6Zo53M0lcY/50007 TEDTALKS CAN'T BE A ONE WAY PROCESS ONE TO MANY
trainval/X6Zo53M0lcY/50008 WHY NOT A SELF FUELING CYCLE IN WHICH WE ALL CAN PARTICIPATE
trainval/X77DUi9PD4Y/50001 I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THE DRIVE I HAVE IN MY TEACHING IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT I WAS DENIED MY OWN PERSONAL
trainval/X77DUi9PD4Y/50002 AND ALL AROUND THE WORLD MATH IS A CORE SUBJECT
trainval/X7uiSiAp8Pc/50001 AND JUST AS WITH THE WALL HOW I WANTED TO BE MORE WALL LIKE WITH THIS PROJECT I'D ACTUALLY LIKE TO TAKE MORE A OF GLACIAL
trainval/x8jdxSlf2Dw/50001 I AM JOE JUSTICE
trainval/x8jdxSlf2Dw/50002 WE TIED FOR 10TH IN THE MAINSTREAM CLASS
trainval/x8jdxSlf2Dw/50003 THAT MEANT THAT WE OUTLASTED MORE THAN 100 OTHER CARS FROM COMPANIES AND UNIVERSITIES
trainval/x8jdxSlf2Dw/50004 THIS LETS US MAKE CHANGES AND DEVELOP QUICKLY
trainval/x8jdxSlf2Dw/50005 WE ARE SAFE BECAUSE WE DESIGN SAFETY TESTS FOR OUR PARTS BEFORE WE EVEN BUILD THEM
trainval/x8jdxSlf2Dw/50006 WE TAKE THIS FROM THE TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOFTWARE WORLD
trainval/x8jdxSlf2Dw/50007 HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE WHEN EXISTING CARS SEEM TO CHANGE SO SLOWLY
trainval/x8jdxSlf2Dw/50008 THESE AGAIN INCREASE OUR VELOCITY AND WE FOUND THAT MORALE IS A MULTIPLIER FOR VELOCITY
trainval/x8jdxSlf2Dw/50009 THIS AVOIDS TIME SPENT TRAINING THAT'S NOT PRODUCTIVE
trainval/x8jdxSlf2Dw/50010 SO WHAT TO DO
trainval/x8jdxSlf2Dw/50011 IF YOU OWN A BUSINESS IDENTIFY A MEMBER OF YOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO BE A PROCESS COACH FOR THE
trainval/x8jdxSlf2Dw/50012 AND IF YOU ARE A PROCESS COACH OR A SCRUM MASTER
trainval/x8jdxSlf2Dw/50013 WE BUILD ULTRA EFFICIENT CARS
trainval/x8jdxSlf2Dw/50014 IF EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM SPENT EVEN JUST TWO HOURS A WEEK RAPIDLY SOLVING PROBLEMS FOR SOCIAL
trainval/x8jdxSlf2Dw/50015 SO WHAT'S WIKISPEED DOING NEXT
trainval/x8jdxSlf2Dw/50016 WE ARE MORE THAN 100 VOLUNTEERS IN EIGHT COUNTRIES NOW
trainval/x8jdxSlf2Dw/50017 YOU'LL SHARPEN YOUR AGILE SKILLS AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD AROUND YOU
trainval/x8jdxSlf2Dw/50018 MANY OF THE MEMBERS OF TEAM WIKISPEED SPENT BETWEEN TWO AND EIGHT HOUR A WEEK HELPING US RAPIDLY DEVELOP OUR
trainval/x8QxdldkPNM/50001 THE CRASH WAS INEVITABLE
trainval/x8QxdldkPNM/50002 NO ECONOMY CAN GROW THAT FAST SAFELY
trainval/x8QxdldkPNM/50003 THEN IT WAS BECAUSE LATVIA WAS STRUGGLING FOR INDEPENDENCE AND THE FAITH OF THE SOVIET UNION HANG IN THE BALANCE
trainval/x8QxdldkPNM/50004 WILL IT BE THE SAME AS IT WAS THERE
trainval/x8QxdldkPNM/50005 IT HAD NO DANGER OF TURNING INTO THAT COUNTRY
trainval/X98Fbe0Ccis/50001 BUT IF YOU KILL ALL THE WOLVES THERE IS NO MORE POWER THERE IS NO MORE LUCK AND ULTIMATELY THERE IS NO MORE
trainval/X98Fbe0Ccis/50002 THERE IS ONE CAMP THAT LOVES CARNIVORES AND WANTS THEM PROTECTED WITHOUT END FOREVER AND EVER ALL OF
trainval/X98Fbe0Ccis/50003 THEY WERE KIND OF BLURRY AND KIND OF GROUCHY AND I SUGGESTED TO THEM THAT THEY MUST REALLY KIND OF HATE THE
trainval/X98Fbe0Ccis/50004 AND IF LIKE ME YOU PREFER YOUR RUGGED OUTDOOR ADVENTURE TEMPERED BY A NICE HOT SHOWER AND A CONVERSATION WITH FRIENDS AT
trainval/X9NFPZGyDPg/50001 IT'S A COMPOUND THAT'S FOUND IN POLYCARBONATE PLASTIC WHICH IS WHAT BABY BOTTLES ARE MADE OUT OF
trainval/X9NFPZGyDPg/50002 SO IT REALLY MAKES YOU REALIZE THE ONUS ON PARENTS TO HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS AND REGULATE THIS AND
trainval/X9NFPZGyDPg/50004 AND SO WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT CHEMICALS CAN PASS THE PLACENTA AND GO INTO YOUR UNBORN
trainval/X9NFPZGyDPg/50005 AND IT'S NOT JUST ATRAZINE THEY'RE EXPOSED TO
trainval/XAcARiiK5uY/50001 AND THIS IS A GREAT AND NECESSARY THING BUT MOST OF THAT ATTENTION HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON A VERY FEW
trainval/XAcARiiK5uY/50002 I'VE OFTEN BEEN VERBALLY ATTACKED BEHIND THEIR DOORS
trainval/XAcARiiK5uY/50003 I'VE BEEN HAULED OUT BY SECURITY GUARDS WITH MY PANTS STILL HALFWAY PULLED UP
trainval/XAcARiiK5uY/50004 HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THESE
trainval/XAcARiiK5uY/50005 THEY TRY TO LEGISLATE TO TRY AND FORCE PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF TO USE THE BATHROOM THAT THEY DEEM
trainval/XAcARiiK5uY/50006 WE NEED FOOD TO EAT
trainval/XAcARiiK5uY/50007 AND MEANWHILE OUR TRANS CHILDREN SUFFER
trainval/XAcARiiK5uY/50008 THEY DROP OUT OF SCHOOL OR THEY OPT OUT OF LIFE ALTOGETHER
trainval/XAcARiiK5uY/50009 I'M TALKING ABOUT COWBOY BOOTS AND CATERPILLAR YELLOW TOY TRUCKS AND BUG JARS THE WHOLE NINE
trainval/XAcARiiK5uY/50010 ONE TIME I ASKED HER WHAT HER FAVORITE COLOR WAS
trainval/XAcARiiK5uY/50011 SHE WAS FOUR YEARS OLD
trainval/XAcARiiK5uY/50012 WHAT ABOUT ANYONE WITH BODY IMAGE STUFF GOING ON
trainval/XAcARiiK5uY/50013 WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES OR WHO NEED ASSISTANCE IN THERE
trainval/XAcARiiK5uY/50014 WHAT ABOUT FOLKS WITH BODIES WHO FOR WHATEVER REASON DON'T FIT INTO THE MAINSTREAM IDEA
trainval/XAcARiiK5uY/50015 HOW MANY OF US STILL FEEL SHY OR AFRAID TO DISROBE IN FRONT
trainval/xAgawjzimjc/50001 I WAS 12 YEARS OLD AND SCOUTED IN A MALL
trainval/xAgawjzimjc/50002 I WOULD SEE THAT PERSON'S EYEBROW RAISE AS I WOULD REPLY
trainval/xAgawjzimjc/50003 WELL I'M A PLUS SIZE MODEL
trainval/xAgawjzimjc/50004 AS A CURVY WOMAN IT WAS THE ASSUMPTION THAT I SHOULD LOOK UP TO MARILYN MONROE OR JENNIFER LOPEZ
trainval/xAgawjzimjc/50005 IN MY LOWEST MOMENTS OF INSECURITY THIS IS WHEN I REALIZED THAT I HAD TO RECLAIM MY
trainval/xAgawjzimjc/50006 THE FEMININE BEAUTY
trainval/XAvE61JqkQs/50002 OURS TEND TO BE 9
trainval/XAvE61JqkQs/50003 THANK YOU GUYS FOR YOUR ATTENTION
trainval/XAvE61JqkQs/50004 THAT'S HOW OLD IT WAS
trainval/XAvE61JqkQs/50005 YOU BASICALLY MAKE A BIG FIRE OUTSIDE THROW SOME ROCKS IN THAT FIRE
trainval/xAXUqSQc8DI/50001 WHEN DID WE COME TO LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE THESE TYPES OF TYPOS COMMON ERRORS THIS DO YOUR BEST ATTITUDE OR JUST GOOD ENOUGH WAS
trainval/xAXUqSQc8DI/50002 WELL TYPOSQUATTING IS WHERE COMPANIES LIKE GOOGLE POST ADVERTISEMENTS ON WEBSITES THAT ARE COMMONLY MISKEYED
trainval/xAXUqSQc8DI/50003 AND YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/xAXUqSQc8DI/50004 4 BILLION DOLLAR AIRCRAFT BECAUSE THE MAINTENANCE CREW ONLY DID 99 PERCENT OF THEIR JOB
trainval/xAXUqSQc8DI/50005 SEE TODAY WE'RE ALL SO AFRAID OF THAT WORD FAILURE BUT THE TRUTH IS WE NEED TO FAIL
trainval/xAXUqSQc8DI/50006 WE ALL KNOW THAT IMPERFECTION EXISTS ALL AROUND US
trainval/xAXUqSQc8DI/50007 STRESS IS BAD FOR US ISN'T IT
trainval/xAXUqSQc8DI/50008 THINK ABOUT THAT
trainval/xAXUqSQc8DI/50009 SO MAYBE WE SHOULD BE MORE LIKE THE PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE OR WE SHOULD BE MORE LIKE THAT TIRELESS PROGRAMMER OR LIKE THAT
trainval/xAXUqSQc8DI/50010 SOMEBODY HAD THE HIGHEST GPA
trainval/xAXUqSQc8DI/50011 I GUARANTEE YOU IT WASN'T A 72 WAY TIE
trainval/xbagFzcyNiM/50001 TODAY I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT MY STORY WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA
trainval/xbagFzcyNiM/50002 BUT IT BECAME VERY PREVALENT IN MY JUNIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL AND THEN IT JUST SNOWBALLED
trainval/xbagFzcyNiM/50003 BECAUSE MY LIFE HAD BECOME A WAKING NIGHTMARE
trainval/xbagFzcyNiM/50004 I WOULD ALSO HALLUCINATE SPIDERS SOMETIMES LITTLE SPIDERS
trainval/xbagFzcyNiM/50005 HOWEVER WHEN IT MOVED ITS LEGS THE CREAKING OF THE LEGS SOUNDED LIKE YOUNG CHILDREN LAUGHING
trainval/xbagFzcyNiM/50006 RED HAIR AND WHITE SKIN
trainval/xbagFzcyNiM/50007 BUT YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW THAT I'M HALLUCINATING
trainval/xbagFzcyNiM/50008 THE CLOWN IS ACTUALLY IN THE AUDIENCE TODAY AND YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW
trainval/xbagFzcyNiM/50009 I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE DIAGNOSIS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA
trainval/xbagFzcyNiM/50010 THIS CAN'T BE ON OUR MEDICAL HISTORY
trainval/xbagFzcyNiM/50011 REDIFER WHERE FRIENDS WERE PASSING BY AND SEEING ME PUT INTO A POLICE CAR
trainval/xbagFzcyNiM/50012 I WAS ACTUALLY AMAZED
trainval/xbagFzcyNiM/50013 AND I'M NOT GOING TO REST UNTIL ANYONE WHO HAS SCHIZOPHRENIA
trainval/xbagFzcyNiM/50014 AND I AM CONFIDENT THAT I WOULD NOT BE HERE TODAY IF I DIDN'T GET THE PROPER MEDICAL HELP
trainval/xbagFzcyNiM/50015 BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM
trainval/xbagFzcyNiM/50016 THERE IS NO NONPROFIT IN THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES FOCUSED ON THAT
trainval/xbagFzcyNiM/50017 WE NEED TO CHANGE THE FACE OF SCHIZOPHRENIA BECAUSE THE REPRESENTATION CURRENTLY IS
trainval/xbagFzcyNiM/50018 I COMMEND HER FOR HER BRAVERY
trainval/xbagFzcyNiM/50019 SO I ADMITTED MYSELF INTO THE EMERGENCY ROOM
trainval/xbagFzcyNiM/50020 I TALKED TO THE DOCTORS THEY SAID OK LET'S FIX THE MEDS YOU CAN STAY HERE OVERNIGHT
trainval/XBaRdmEVy8s/50001 I MEAN HE DIDN'T EVEN HESITATE
trainval/XBaRdmEVy8s/50002 THEY REALLY BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN SEE WORLD PEACE IN THEIR LIFETIME
trainval/XBcPFhg0BC8/50001 WE HAVE GREAT TECHNICIANS WHO'VE WORKED OUT A LOT OF GREAT TECHNIQUES FOR FURTHER PROCESSING
trainval/XbgdpsXDU2o/50001 THIS ROOM BY THE VERY NATURE OF THIS EVENT IS CLEARLY FULL OF INDEPENDENT THINKERS
trainval/XbgdpsXDU2o/50003 AND SOME PROJECTS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN BROUGHT TO MARKET THROUGH THIS PROCESS FAMOUSLY GMAIL
trainval/XbgdpsXDU2o/50004 QUESTIONING THE NORM
trainval/XbgdpsXDU2o/50006 AND THEY SHOULD BE APPLAUDED AND WE NEED MORE OF THEM
trainval/xbWcLYOniWU/50001 COULD I CALL YOU BACK
trainval/xbWcLYOniWU/50002 HOW DO WE CLOSE THAT GAP THAT I DESCRIBED BETWEEN THE
trainval/xbWcLYOniWU/50003 AND SO WE HAVE TALKED TO THE WRITERS GUILD IN HOLLYWOOD AND GUESS WHAT
trainval/xbWcLYOniWU/50004 HOW DO WE CHANGE THIS
trainval/xcR1SWhjZys/50001 ALL THE WHILE THERE IS NO PERSONAL EXPRESSION GOING ON
trainval/xcR1SWhjZys/50002 SO IN THE CASE OF THE TCHAIKOVSKY ROMEO AND JULIET I MENTIONED THAT IT BEGINS WITH FOUR INSTRUMENTS TWO CLARINETS TWO
trainval/xcR1SWhjZys/50003 EACH ONE HAS AN INDEPENDENT VOICE SO IT'S LIKE A CHORAL AND WE KNOW TCHAIKOVSKY IS RUSSIAN HE WAS RAISED
trainval/xcR1SWhjZys/50004 THIS IS HOW MUSIC COMES TO LIFE
trainval/xcR1SWhjZys/50005 SO LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW WE GET AN ORCHESTRA TO ACTUALLY MAKE A SOUND TOGETHER
trainval/xcR1SWhjZys/50006 SO I WILL I'M GOING TO TURN YOU NOW ALL OF YOU INTO ONE GIANT TEDX CLAPPING ORCHESTRA
trainval/xcR1SWhjZys/50007 NOW FOR MANY OF US OUR FIRST VIEWS ON THIS SUBJECT WERE SHAPED BY A GREAT COLLEAGUE OF
trainval/xcR1SWhjZys/50008 VERY NICE GOOD HEALTHY FORTE
trainval/xcR1SWhjZys/50009 IN PROPER SCHOOL FASHION OUR CRASH COURSE CONTINUES THE RIGHT HAND IS USED TO KEEP THE ORCHESTRA
trainval/xcR1SWhjZys/50010 THIS IS WHY WE NEED GREAT ART
trainval/XDBWEKBq0Sw/50001 THAT SOUNDS SIMPLE
trainval/XDBWEKBq0Sw/50002 THAT'S OUR AVERAGE BUDGET
trainval/xDe346z233Y/50001 THERE IS NO FREE MOVEMENT FOR THE HUMAN BEINGS
trainval/xDe346z233Y/50003 A BIG CONFLICT BIG QUESTIONS WHAT CAN I DO AS A HUMAN BEING
trainval/xDe346z233Y/50004 WHEN I MET FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE RAMI ELHANAN AN ISRAELI HE LOST HIS DAUGHTER
trainval/xDe346z233Y/50005 I WILL NEVER FORGET WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
trainval/xDe346z233Y/50006 I'M 40 YEARS OLD
trainval/xDe346z233Y/50007 I'M AN ISRAELI
trainval/xDe346z233Y/50008 WE CAN FIND THE HUMAN SIDE IN THIS CONFLICT WHICH IS WHAT NO ONE CARES ABOUT ALL THE POLITICIANS
trainval/xDe346z233Y/50009 I HAVE THREE SONS
trainval/xDe346z233Y/50010 TODAY TOGETHER IN THE PARENTS CIRCLE THE BEREAVED FAMILIES FORUM YES WE ARE
trainval/xDe346z233Y/50011 SO THE JEWISH SOCIETY WE HAVE PERSPECTIVE
trainval/xDe346z233Y/50012 AND THIS IS OUR MISSION OUR HOLY MISSION AND IT WILL BE FOREVER
trainval/Xe2nlti47kA/50001 I WAS NOT GOING TO STAY IN MY OFFICE I WAS NOT GOING TO DELEGATE MY WORK AND I
trainval/Xe2nlti47kA/50002 SO I ASSEMBLED A TOP NOTCH LEADERSHIP TEAM WHO BELIEVED IN THE POSSIBILITY OF ALL THE CHILDREN
trainval/Xe2nlti47kA/50003 WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT IT
trainval/xEtXItg9hEE/50001 ALL OF THIS IS MEASURABLE AND COULD BE IN THE NEW GOALS
trainval/xEtXItg9hEE/50002 SHOULD THOSE BE IN THE NEW PACKAGE OF GOALS
trainval/xEtXItg9hEE/50003 OFTEN THEY'RE NOT IN THE RIGHT PLACE
trainval/xEtXItg9hEE/50004 SOME PEOPLE DON'T
trainval/xEtXItg9hEE/50005 NOBODY THINKS IT IS
trainval/xEtXItg9hEE/50006 RIGHT NOW THEY DON'T AND IT WOULD BE GREAT TO FIND A WAY TO BETTER COMMUNICATE IT BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT
trainval/xf8zep5BADs/50001 WHAT DO YOU CALL THE LEADER OF A REPUBLICAN COUNTRY
trainval/xf8zep5BADs/50002 AND SO THE SENATE WON IN THE END
trainval/xfDUGqGPSfo/50001 WELL IF YOU'RE ME YOU PROCRASTINATE AND YOU GO ON THE INTERNET
trainval/xfDUGqGPSfo/50002 I PLAYED IN THE WOODS I BUILT FORTS I CAUGHT FROGS
trainval/xfDUGqGPSfo/50003 ONCE THE KIDS ARE LED ACROSS THE BRIDGE NO ADULT IS ALLOWED TO FOLLOW
trainval/xfDUGqGPSfo/50004 I CAN TELL YOU ALL TO LET YOUR CHILDREN GO JUST AS I HAVE THE SAME THOUGHTS AS YOU WHEN I HEAR
trainval/xfjZStWFxpA/50001 MOST RECENT STUDIES WOULD TELL YOU THAT MEDIA STEREOTYPES SURROUNDING BLACK QUARTERBACKS BEING
trainval/XFOkSdlPafQ/50001 WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THESE FOODS
trainval/XFOkSdlPafQ/50002 HOW HAVE THESE FOODS CHANGED
trainval/XFOkSdlPafQ/50003 SO THE SALE OF TRANS FAT ALTERNATIVES WENT THROUGH THE ROOF DURING THIS DECADE
trainval/XFOkSdlPafQ/50004 THEY ARE ANTI INFLAMMATORY
trainval/XFOkSdlPafQ/50005 THESE FUNCTIONAL FOODS HAVE BEEN A REVELATION FOR FOOD MANUFACTURERS EVERYWHERE BECAUSE THEY'VE SHOWN THAT
trainval/XFOkSdlPafQ/50006 THIS WAS LONG BEFORE WE HAD THE RESEARCH KNOW HOW AND EVEN THE TECHNOLOGY TO BE ABLE TO PROVE THAT
trainval/XFOkSdlPafQ/50007 IS THIS A REAL POSSIBILITY
trainval/XFOkSdlPafQ/50008 WE'RE ALL STARTING TO WEAR FITBITS PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO TAKE NOTICE OF THEIR OWN HEALTH
trainval/XFOkSdlPafQ/50009 WE NOW HAVE TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL MEASURE AND MONITOR OUR OWN HEALTH AND GIVE US SOME INFORMATION AND FEEDBACK
trainval/XFOkSdlPafQ/50010 BUT THE WAY IN WHICH YOUR BODY SEES THESE BACTERIA AND VIRUSES IS THE SAME WAY THAT IT CAN SEE AND RECOGNIZE
trainval/XFOkSdlPafQ/50011 ARE SAYING THAT THEY SPEND THREE OUT OF EVERY FOUR DOLLARS IN PAYOUTS FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC DISEASE
trainval/XFOkSdlPafQ/50012 WILL YOUR HEALTH INSURER BE DICTATING WHAT YOU EAT AND WILL FOOD NO LONGER BECOME A CHOICE BUT RATHER A WAY
trainval/XFOkSdlPafQ/50013 AND ASK YOURSELF THE QUESTION
trainval/xGGtRQ3wCB4/50001 IT'S A MILD VERSION OF STAGE FRIGHT
trainval/xGGtRQ3wCB4/50002 THIS IS A BELLY BREATH
trainval/xgKqX5Yj3b8/50001 I WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE PIANO FOR YOU
trainval/xgKqX5Yj3b8/50002 YOU GET MENTAL IMAGES
trainval/xgKqX5Yj3b8/50003 YEAH IT'S RANDOM DISORGANIZED
trainval/xgKqX5Yj3b8/50004 LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT IT
trainval/xgKqX5Yj3b8/50005 AND THEY'VE DONE IT ONCE
trainval/xgKqX5Yj3b8/50006 SO IT'S NOT THE STRAW THAT BREAKS THE CAMEL'S BACK
trainval/XGq3MXQlRJs/50001 AND PART OF OUR RESEARCH IS AIMING FOR THAT OF COURSE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO
trainval/XGq3MXQlRJs/50004 SO LOUD NOISE EXPOSURE IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST RISKS
trainval/XGq3MXQlRJs/50005 HEARING LOSS IS THE SECOND MOST FREQUENT ONE
trainval/XGq3MXQlRJs/50006 AND IT'S A VERY SIMILAR THING
trainval/XGq3MXQlRJs/50007 IN THIS CASE AGAIN THE BRAIN IS THE CAUSE FOR THIS
trainval/XGq3MXQlRJs/50008 SO WHAT THE BRAIN DOES IT KIND OF FILLS IN THAT GAP
trainval/XGq3MXQlRJs/50009 ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE BLIND SPOT IN YOUR EYE
trainval/XGq3MXQlRJs/50010 SO MOST PEOPLE ACTUALLY EVEN AFTER EXTENSIVE LOUD NOISE EXPOSURE DON'T GET TINNITUS
trainval/XGq3MXQlRJs/50013 THEY ALL PLAY THEIR ROLE AND THEY INTERACT WITH THE SENSORY SYSTEMS AND ARE ABLE
trainval/XGq3MXQlRJs/50014 IT MAY HAPPEN SOMETIMES WITH ACCIDENTS
trainval/XGq3MXQlRJs/50015 THERE WAS A STUDY BEFORE THAT SHOWED IF WE HEAR UNPLEASANT SOUNDS THE SAME REGION LIGHTS UP
trainval/XGq3MXQlRJs/50016 SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT THIS REGION WAS AFFECTED BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW AT THE TIME HOW
trainval/XgRlrBlS7Yg/50001 HE HAD HAD 20 MINUTES OF GLORIOUS MUSIC
trainval/XgRlrBlS7Yg/50002 OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
trainval/XgRlrBlS7Yg/50003 BUT ONE OF THEM IS DISTINCTLY WORSE THAN THE OTHER
trainval/XgRlrBlS7Yg/50004 AND YOU CAN ASK WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE MOMENTS
trainval/XgRlrBlS7Yg/50005 THIS APPLIES TO LAYPEOPLE THINKING ABOUT THEIR OWN HAPPINESS AND IT APPLIES TO SCHOLARS THINKING ABOUT HAPPINESS
trainval/XgRlrBlS7Yg/50006 WHAT ARE THE EMOTIONS THAT CAN BE MEASURED
trainval/XgRlrBlS7Yg/50007 VERY DIFFERENT NOTION
trainval/xh8el8m9mLM/50001 BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAPPEN
trainval/xh8el8m9mLM/50002 I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU STRATEGIES AND I CALL THEM BRAIN POWERS
trainval/xh8el8m9mLM/50003 THE BRAIN POWER OF ONE
trainval/xh8el8m9mLM/50004 AND IT'S WHERE YOU TAKE INFORMATION IN FROM ALL THE SOURCES BLEND IT WITH THE RICH KNOWLEDGE THAT'S
trainval/xh8el8m9mLM/50005 GET OFF OF AUTOMATIC PILOT
trainval/xh8el8m9mLM/50006 IT HATES STATUS QUO AND IT HATES AUTOMATIC PILOT
trainval/XiDAztWWAuM/50001 SOMETIMES I GET MEAN TWEETS AND HATE MAIL
trainval/XiDAztWWAuM/50002 SOMETIMES I GET VOICE MAILS SAYING THAT IF I CONTINUE TELLING MY JOKES THEY'LL KILL
trainval/XiDAztWWAuM/50003 AND THOSE DEATH THREATS ARE DEFINITELY NOT FUNNY
trainval/XiDAztWWAuM/50004 SO WHAT I'VE DONE IS CREATED A HIGHLY SCIENTIFIC TAXONOMY OF HATERS
trainval/XiDAztWWAuM/50005 BUT THEY JUST DON'T MAKE THEM LIKE THEY USED TO WHICH IS ANOTHER SIGN OF THE DECLINE IN AMERICA
trainval/XiDAztWWAuM/50006 AND THEY DO IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION
trainval/XiDAztWWAuM/50007 THIS IS THE GROUP I LIKE TO TARGET WITH SOCIAL JUSTICE COMEDY
trainval/XiDAztWWAuM/50008 IT'S ABOUT JUSTICE
trainval/XiEQmcZi8cM/50001 THAT'S ALL WE KNOW
trainval/XiEQmcZi8cM/50002 SOMETHING IN ME JUST KNOWS
trainval/XiEQmcZi8cM/50003 AS THEY BEGAN TO EAT THEY HEARD A KNOCK ON THE DOOR
trainval/XiEQmcZi8cM/50004 THE POLICE ISSUED A PREMATURE PUBLIC STATEMENT THAT MORNING ECHOING HIS CLAIMS WITHOUT BOTHERING TO QUESTION IT OR FURTHER
trainval/XiEQmcZi8cM/50005 THERE WAS NO ARGUMENT
trainval/XiEQmcZi8cM/50006 A TERRORIST ATTACK
trainval/XII0TdSvloM/50001 BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WINE
trainval/XII0TdSvloM/50002 A WINE LABEL
trainval/XII0TdSvloM/50003 THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH
trainval/XiSPD5aZT7Q/50001 THE SCALE OF THE CHALLENGE FOR ARCHITECTS AND FOR SOCIETY TO DEAL WITH IN BUILDING IS TO FIND A
trainval/XiSPD5aZT7Q/50002 MASS TIMBER PANELS ARE THOSE 24 DOT BRICKS
trainval/XiSPD5aZT7Q/50003 IF I ASKED YOU TO TAKE A MATCH AND LIGHT IT AND HOLD UP A LOG AND TRY TO GET THAT LOG TO GO ON FIRE IT
trainval/XiSPD5aZT7Q/50004 WE ALL KNOW THAT
trainval/XiSPD5aZT7Q/50005 WELL MASS TIMBER PANELS THESE NEW PRODUCTS THAT WE'RE USING ARE MUCH LIKE THE LOG
trainval/xjSQFZX2m9o/50001 THE TRAINING USES SIMPLE FOCUSING TECHNIQUES TO ACCOMPLISH THIS
trainval/xjSQFZX2m9o/50002 SO A TRAINING PARTNER A TEACHER WILL PUSH ON ME TO SEE HOW STABLE I AM ON MY FEET
trainval/xjSQFZX2m9o/50003 MOVING UP THE TRAIL WE FIND VESTIBULAR ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN'S MEMORY CENTER THE
trainval/xjuY3lUfkK8/50001 I FIND THAT ASTOUNDING
trainval/xjuY3lUfkK8/50002 THERE MAY BE LESS OXYGEN PRESENT THERE MAY BE MORE PATHOGENS THERE AND THERE MAY BE TOXINS PRODUCED BY SOME OF
trainval/xjuY3lUfkK8/50003 MY GOAL IS THAT AFTER THIS SHORT JOURNEY YOU'LL SHARE MY AMAZEMENT AT HOW DEEPLY CONNECTED OUR LIVES
trainval/xjuY3lUfkK8/50004 HOW DO WE HELP THE REEF THAT LOOKS LIKE THE RIGHT BACK TOWARDS SOMETHING THAT LOOKS MORE LIKE
trainval/xjuY3lUfkK8/50005 THERE'S ALSO SOME EVIDENCE THAT THE HEALTHY MICROBES ON THE CORAL CAN FIGHT OFF THE
trainval/xjuY3lUfkK8/50006 WHAT ELSE ARE ALL OF THE UNSEEN MICROBES DOING TO KEEP US AND OUR OCEANS HEALTHY
trainval/xjuY3lUfkK8/50007 BUT MICROBIAL ECOLOGISTS HAVE DESPERATELY NEEDED BREAKTHROUGHS IN TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS WITH THIS FAST
trainval/xjxyEwjG2Es/50001 WE SOLVED THAT PROBLEM LAST WEEK
trainval/xjxyEwjG2Es/50002 WE WROTE A COMPACTION ROUTINE THAT REDUCES THE SIZE OF ALL FONTS BY AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE
trainval/xjxyEwjG2Es/50003 YOU CAN HAVE AS MANY FONTS ON YOUR SYSTEM AS YOU LIKE
trainval/xjxyEwjG2Es/50004 THE ENGINEERS HAVE A PROBLEM
trainval/XKc9MJDeqj0/50001 IT HAPPENED TO LOTS OF MAMMALS
trainval/XKc9MJDeqj0/50002 WHERE WOULD YOU START
trainval/XKc9MJDeqj0/50003 WELL YOU'D START BY FINDING OUT IF THE BIOTECH IS REALLY THERE
trainval/XKc9MJDeqj0/50004 THEN THE QUESTION IS CAN YOU REASSEMBLE WITH THAT GENOME THE WHOLE BIRD
trainval/XKc9MJDeqj0/50005 I THINK IT'S TIME FOR THE SUBJECT TO GO PUBLIC
trainval/XKc9MJDeqj0/50006 WHAT DO PEOPLE THINK ABOUT IT
trainval/XKc9MJDeqj0/50007 YOU KNOW DO YOU WANT EXTINCT SPECIES BACK
trainval/XKiQl5WZQ5I/50001 BUT IF YOU LOOK IN YOUR HANDS OR IN YOUR LAPS OR IN YOUR HANDBAGS I BET YOU'VE GOT A PHONE OR A LAPTOP OR A
trainval/XKiQl5WZQ5I/50002 HOW COOL IS THAT
trainval/XKiQl5WZQ5I/50003 THEY'VE HAD A TASTE OF CODE AND REALIZED THIS IS SOMETHING THEY WANT TO DO MORE OF
trainval/XKiQl5WZQ5I/50004 GIRLS ARE OPEN TOO
trainval/XKiQl5WZQ5I/50005 I DON'T KNOW WHY IT IS THERE ARE SOME REASONS OUT THERE WE NEED TO CHANGE BUT I WANT YOU ALL TO THINK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN HELP THAT CHANGE
trainval/XKiQl5WZQ5I/50006 GIRLS NOW HAVE A PEER GROUP THAT CAN SUPPORT THEM AS THEY GO THROUGH THEIR CAREER
trainval/xkq8drS5ofs/50001 I MEAN I'M IN COLLEGE HE'S IN COLLEGE
trainval/xkq8drS5ofs/50002 WE BOTH HAVE SCHEDULES THIS IS OUR WEEKEND AND OTHER PEOPLE WANT OUR TIME TOO
trainval/xkq8drS5ofs/50003 SO I'M HERE TO FIND ANOTHER TOPIC AND I'M GOING TO CALL IT INTENTIONAL CONVERSATION
trainval/xkq8drS5ofs/50004 I THINK MY FAVORITE ONE IS ABOUT A FRIEND WHO TOOK A TRIP TO PANAMA
trainval/xkq8drS5ofs/50005 HE COULD SAY
trainval/Xl6wxnnSStI/50001 IT'S A PRANK BUT IT'S A PRANK THAT GIVES SOMEBODY A GREAT STORY TO TELL
trainval/Xl6wxnnSStI/50002 AND HER REACTION INSPIRED ME TO DO A SECOND ANNUAL NO PANTS SUBWAY RIDE
trainval/Xl6wxnnSStI/50003 AND WE'VE CONTINUED TO DO IT EVERY YEAR
trainval/Xl6wxnnSStI/50004 SO IT SEEMED LIKE MAYBE SHE HAD BEEN DARED TO DO THIS
trainval/Xl6wxnnSStI/50005 SO I GOT INSPIRED BY THAT
trainval/Xl6wxnnSStI/50006 THE NEXT PROJECT I WANT TO SHOW WAS GIVEN TO ME IN AN EMAIL FROM A STRANGER
trainval/Xl6wxnnSStI/50007 AND YOU KNOW NOT EVERYBODY'S GOING TO LIKE EVERYTHING YOU DO AND I'VE CERTAINLY DEVELOPED A THICK SKIN THANKS TO INTERNET COMMENTS BUT
trainval/Xl6wxnnSStI/50008 AND WE'RE NEVER GIVEN A REASON WHY WE SHOULD PLAY
trainval/Xl6wxnnSStI/50009 IT'S JUST ACCEPTABLE THAT PLAY IS A GOOD THING
trainval/Xl6wxnnSStI/50010 WE DON'T NEED A REASON
trainval/Xl6wxnnSStI/50011 ONE THING THE MANAGERS WERE TRYING TO DO WAS TO TRACK DOWN OUR CAMERAS
trainval/Xl6wxnnSStI/50012 AND THEY CAUGHT A COUPLE OF MY GUYS WHO HAD HIDDEN CAMERAS IN DUFFEL BAGS
trainval/xlGG1OSpbKk/50001 SO I'M SURE THAT YOU HAVE ARRIVED BY NOW AT THE SAME SOLUTION I DID A TIME AGO AND THAT IS IS THAT WE NEED AN ELECTRICAL
trainval/xlGG1OSpbKk/50002 THEN LATER WHEN ELECTRICAL DEMAND INCREASES YOU CAN FLOW THAT WATER OVER THAT DAM THROUGH THE GENERATORS AND PRODUCE
trainval/xlGG1OSpbKk/50003 WHILE IN UNDERGRAD AT KENT STATE I FOUND MY PASSION FOR BOTH CHEMISTRY AND THE ENERGY INDUSTRY AND IT WAS THROUGH THESE TWO
trainval/xlggecnjOY0/50001 HE EVENTUALLY GETS MARRIED
trainval/xlggecnjOY0/50002 OFTEN IT'S YOUTH WHO SUFFER FROM THE HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATES
trainval/xlggecnjOY0/50003 THEY HAD NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT STARTING UP A BUSINESS
trainval/xlggecnjOY0/50004 MOHAMED IS NOT SIMPLY SELLING FLOWERS
trainval/xlggecnjOY0/50005 I BELIEVE HE IS SELLING HOPE
trainval/XLi6iYnnsGc/50001 LET ME JUST GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE
trainval/XLi6iYnnsGc/50002 SOME USE AND ADVOCATE VIOLENCE SOME DO NOT BUT THEY ARE OFTEN INTERRELATED
trainval/XLi6iYnnsGc/50003 THEY TAKE DIFFERENT FORMS SOME MAY BE NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS EVEN HERE IN BRITAIN LIKE CAGE
trainval/XLi6iYnnsGc/50004 WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS THE MUSLIM EXTREME RIGHT AND THE FACT THAT ITS ADHERENTS ARE OR PURPORT
trainval/XLi6iYnnsGc/50005 WHEN I LOOK BACK NOW I THINK THAT THAT WAS THE MOMENT THAT SET ME ON THE PATH TO WRITING A BOOK CALLED YOUR
trainval/XLi6iYnnsGc/50006 AND SO BOMBERS STRUCK THEIR 2008 8TH WORLD PERFORMING ARTS FESTIVAL IN LAHORE
trainval/XLi6iYnnsGc/50007 AND LATER THAT SAME NIGHT THE PEER ZAIDA'S MADE A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION
trainval/XLi6iYnnsGc/50008 AS FAIZAN SAID AT THE TIME IF WE BOW DOWN TO THE ISLAMISTS WE'LL JUST BE SITTING IN A DARK CORNER
trainval/XLi6iYnnsGc/50009 AND SHE SAID I KNOW THAT BUT I CAME TO YOUR FESTIVAL WITH MY MOTHER WHEN I WAS THEIR AGE AND I
trainval/XLi6iYnnsGc/50010 AND THEN THE NEXT YEAR THEY LOST ALL OF THEIR SPONSORS DUE TO THE SECURITY RISK
trainval/XLi6iYnnsGc/50011 AN AFGHAN PROSECUTOR HAS BEEN ASSASSINATED
trainval/XLi6iYnnsGc/50012 BUT HE DOESN'T JUST CRITICIZE THE MOSQUE HE ALSO TAKES ON THE GOVERNMENT FOR ITS FAILURE TO DO MORE TO PREVENT
trainval/XLi6iYnnsGc/50013 HE TOLD ME ONE DAY WE SAW THE IMAM ON TV CALLING US INFIDELS AND SAYING THESE
trainval/XLi6iYnnsGc/50014 17 PM WHICH WE KNOW BECAUSE WHEN SHE FELL IN THE STREET HER WATCH BROKE
trainval/xlngY8QCEt0/50001 PLACES LIKE SEATTLE HAVE INSTALLED ENTIRE PARKS THAT ARE EDIBLE
trainval/xlngY8QCEt0/50002 A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT CAN BE SEEN WITH WATER
trainval/xLuMcYn8Yk0/50001 TODAY I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU MY BIRMINGHAM STORY
trainval/xLuMcYn8Yk0/50003 WHY DID YOU LEAVE ALL THESE BEHIND
trainval/xMjSPS6H69g/50001 PEOPLE WOULD YELL AT ME FROM THEIR CARS
trainval/xMjSPS6H69g/50002 I'VE ALWAYS BEEN WITH MY BAND OR MY CREW
trainval/xMjSPS6H69g/50003 IS THIS WHAT STUPID PEOPLE DO
trainval/xMjSPS6H69g/50004 WE SIGN AND THERE'S ALL THIS HYPE LEADING UP TO OUR NEXT RECORD
trainval/xMjSPS6H69g/50005 AND THEY WALK OFF
trainval/xmlekZSSOWE/50001 A SMALL TRIBE
trainval/xmlekZSSOWE/50002 THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND
trainval/xmlekZSSOWE/50003 CHIEF ALMIR CAME TO GOOGLE AND HE ASKED US
trainval/xmlekZSSOWE/50004 HE TRAVELED THOUSANDS OF MILES AND MANY DAYS
trainval/xmlekZSSOWE/50005 I HOPE YOU GET TO KNOW CHIEF ALMIR TODAY YOU WILL FIND HE'S VERY PERSISTENT AND HE IS VERY PERSUASIVE
trainval/xmlekZSSOWE/50006 HE ALSO TOLD US
trainval/xmlekZSSOWE/50007 I'M NOT ASKING YOU FOR HELP I'D LIKE TO HAVE A PARTNERSHIP
trainval/xmlekZSSOWE/50008 WE'VE ALL BEEN TATTOOED
trainval/xmlekZSSOWE/50009 PEOPLE ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM BUT PEOPLE ARE THE SOLUTION TO ALL OF THESE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
trainval/xMS9HlSSLSA/50001 MY FAMILY HAD SEEN SUMMER HEAT SO INTENSE THAT IT SPLIT ANCIENT OAK TREES
trainval/xMS9HlSSLSA/50002 AND WE'VE SEEN OUR NEIGHBORS DEVASTATED BY HUNDREDS OF WILDFIRES
trainval/xMS9HlSSLSA/50003 MOST OF US ALREADY KNOW THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HUGE PROBLEM BUT THE BIG
trainval/xMS9HlSSLSA/50004 WHAT THESE APPS ALL HAVE IN COMMON IS THEY'RE TAKING PREVIOUSLY INVISIBLE
trainval/xMS9HlSSLSA/50005 THAT'S ABOUT ONE THIRD OF CHINA'S URBAN POPULATION IN A WEEKEND
trainval/xMS9HlSSLSA/50006 SO HOW WILL YOU CHANGE THE WORLD
trainval/XMSQKG70a5s/50001 THEY MIGHT RUN OUT OF PROPELLANT THEY COULD MALFUNCTION OR THEY MAY JUST NATURALLY REACH THE END OF THEIR
trainval/XMSQKG70a5s/50002 YOU'VE GOT YOUR MUSIC CRANKED YOUR WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN WITH THE COOL BREEZE BLOWING THROUGH YOUR HAIR
trainval/XMSQKG70a5s/50003 IN THAT INSTANT MOMENT OF PANIC YOU SCAN YOUR FRONT DASHBOARD LOOKING FOR WHAT COULD BE WRONG
trainval/XMSQKG70a5s/50004 AND THEN YOU EYE THAT YOUR FULE GAUGE HAS DROPPED BELOW EMPTY
trainval/XMSQKG70a5s/50005 YOU'RE OUT OF GAS
trainval/XMSQKG70a5s/50006 BUT THEN YOU SUDDENLY REMEMBER THAT THIS CAR YOU BOUGHT COULD NEVER BE FIXED IF A PART BREAKS OR
trainval/XMSQKG70a5s/50007 IT JUST WASN'T DESIGNED THAT WAY
trainval/XMSQKG70a5s/50008 AND IMAGINE THE DEBRIS THAT WOULD BE STREWN EVERYWHERE IF A COLLISION ACTUALLY HAPPENED THOUSANDS OF
trainval/XMSQKG70a5s/50009 NOW WE SEND SATELLITES TO DIFFERENT ORBITS DEPENDING ON WHAT THEY'RE NEEDED FOR
trainval/XMSQKG70a5s/50010 ONE OF THE MOST COMMON PLACES WE SEND SATELLITES IS THE LOW EARTH ORBIT POSSIBLY TO IMAGE THE SURFACE OF EARTH
trainval/XMSQKG70a5s/50011 THESE GUIDELINES ARE ALSO NOT LONG TERM THEY'RE NOT PROACTIVE NOR DO THEY ADDRESS THE DEBRIS THAT'S
trainval/XMSQKG70a5s/50012 THEY'RE ONLY IN PLACE TO LIMIT THE FUTURE CREATION OF DEBRIS
trainval/XMSQKG70a5s/50013 SO I GREW UP WITH THE HUGE APPRECIATION FOR THE OUTDOORS AND THE KEEN SENSE OF OUR FOOTPRINT ON THE ENVIRONMENTS WE INTERACT
trainval/XMSQKG70a5s/50014 NOW MOUNT EVEREST IS ACTUALLY AN INTERESTING COMPARISON OF A NEW APPROACH TO HOW WE INTERACT WITH OUR ENVIRONMENTS
trainval/XMSQKG70a5s/50015 THERE'S AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING INTERNET CONNECTIVITY NAVIGATION
trainval/XMSQKG70a5s/50016 SATELLITES EVEN PLAY A ROLE IN THE OPERATION OF OUR FINANCIAL AND ENERGY MARKETS
trainval/XMSQKG70a5s/50017 WHAT IF THERE ACTUALLY WERE INTERNATIONAL LAWS WITH TEETH THAT ENFORCED END OF LIFE DISPOSAL OF
trainval/XMSQKG70a5s/50018 SO MAYBE YOU GET INTO THINGS LIKE HIGH POWERED LASERS OR TUGGING USING NETS OR TETHERS AS CRAZY AS THOSE
trainval/XMSQKG70a5s/50019 AND THEN ONE REALLY COOL POSSIBILITY IS THE IDEA OF ORBITAL TOW TRUCKS OR SPACE MECHANICS
trainval/XMSQKG70a5s/50020 IMAGINE IF A ROBOTIC ARM ON SOME SORT OF SPACE TOW TRUCK COULD FIX THE BROKEN COMPONENTS ON A SATELLITE
trainval/XMSQKG70a5s/50021 THERE'S ALSO COMPLEX SPACE LAWS AND POLITICS THAT WE HAVE TO SORT OUT
trainval/XMSQKG70a5s/50022 THERE IS WITHOUT DOUBT CONGESTION IN THE LOW EARTH AND GEOSTATIONARY ORBITS AND WE CANNOT KEEP LAUNCHING NEW
trainval/XMSQKG70a5s/50023 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULDN'T DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENTS THAT WE RELY AND
trainval/XMSQKG70a5s/50024 WHAT IF ALL SATELLITES REGARDLESS OF WHAT COUNTRY THEY WERE BUILT IN HAD TO BE STANDARDIZED IN SOME WAY FOR
trainval/XnhhoRSnisc/50001 WHY SHOULD YOU CARE ABOUT INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS
trainval/XnhhoRSnisc/50002 FOR THE LONGEST TIME WE HAD TO RELY ON THESE FACULTIES BECAUSE WE DID NOT HAVE ANY ALTERNATIVES
trainval/xNiBDGBw4Zs/50001 AND WE DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY WHICH PART OF THE BRAIN IS ENGAGED IN PROCESSING TIME
trainval/xNiBDGBw4Zs/50002 VERY NATURALLY THOUGH
trainval/xNiBDGBw4Zs/50003 SO WITHOUT COUNTING WITHOUT LOOKING AT YOUR WATCH
trainval/xnLoToJVQH4/50001 ALRIGHT MY FRIENDS
trainval/xnLoToJVQH4/50002 ALRIGHT ARE YOU READY
trainval/xnLoToJVQH4/50003 THIS IS CALLED FORMAL MEDITATION
trainval/xnLoToJVQH4/50004 SO WHY DON'T WE TRY IT NOW
trainval/xnovQVRHj5c/50001 SO LIKE IN REAL LIFE WHEN THE PROTAGONIST DIES ALONE IN THE ARCTIC MAYBE GETS EATEN BY A
trainval/XO1MeSMYSQ0/50001 THE COURT SYSTEM WASN'T FUNCTIONING PROPERLY
trainval/XO1MeSMYSQ0/50002 SO WHAT WAS A BUSINESS MAN IN THE BRAVE NEW WORLD OF EAST EUROPEAN
trainval/XO1MeSMYSQ0/50003 I LIKE TO CALL IT THE GLOBAL SHADOW ECONOMY OR MCMAFIA FOR SHORT
trainval/XO1MeSMYSQ0/50004 THIS BOAT IS WORTH ONE MILLION EUROS WHEN IT'S NEW
trainval/XO1MeSMYSQ0/50005 NOW COLTAN YOU WILL FIND IN ALMOST EVERY MOBILE PHONE IN ALMOST EVERY LAPTOP AND
trainval/XO1MeSMYSQ0/50006 THE CONGOLESE WAR LORDS WERE SELLING THIS STUFF TO THE MAFIA IN EXCHANGE FOR WEAPONS AND THE MAFIA WOULD
trainval/XO1MeSMYSQ0/50007 WHEN THAT HAPPENS IT IS A TREND WHICH IS SET TO OVERWHELM OUR POLICING CAPACITY IN THE WEST
trainval/XO1MeSMYSQ0/50008 THEY AFFECT OUR COMMUNICATIONS OUR PENSION FUNDS
trainval/XoBSE2C1u0s/50001 HAVE YOU HEARD OF THIS
trainval/XoBSE2C1u0s/50003 AS IMPROVISERS WE TRAIN OURSELVES TO LISTEN WHOLLY TO LISTEN WITH THE WILLINGNESS TO
trainval/XOU2ubWkoPw/50001 I WAS DRAWN INTO THE SPACE BETWEEN
trainval/XOU2ubWkoPw/50002 IT'S NOT OKAY SO FAR IT'S ACTUALLY A TRAIN WRECK
trainval/XOU2ubWkoPw/50003 ZIAD IS TAKING A CLASSIC PARENTING APPROACH ASSUMING THAT HE KNOWS BEST AND
trainval/XOU2ubWkoPw/50004 SO HIS APPROACH WAS
trainval/XOU2ubWkoPw/50005 HOW DO WE TAKE STUFF OFF YOUR PLATE
trainval/XOU2ubWkoPw/50006 HOW DO WE FREE UP MIND SPACE FOR YOU BECAUSE I KNOW THIS IS STRESSFUL FOR YOU
trainval/XOU2ubWkoPw/50007 WHY DO WE FEEL SO PLEASURABLE
trainval/XOU2ubWkoPw/50008 AFTER CHRISTMAS I WAS OUT WITH ANOTHER FRIEND WHO KNOWS TYLER WELL AND I HAD MENTIONED WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO TYLER
trainval/XOU2ubWkoPw/50009 MY FRIEND INVESTED FIVE SECONDS
trainval/XOU2ubWkoPw/50010 WHAT WAS IT LIKE THE FIRST TIME YOU SAW HIM AGAIN
trainval/XOU2ubWkoPw/50011 AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS ANOTHER WHOLE LAYER OF WHAT MATTERS MOST CAME OUT OF A FATHER WHO ALMOST
trainval/XOU2ubWkoPw/50012 MY ENERGY LEVEL AFTER THE FIRST CONVERSATION WAS THROUGH THE FLOOR
trainval/xp0O2vi8DX4/50001 AND IT'S NOT JUST US
trainval/xp0O2vi8DX4/50002 AND SO THE QUESTION IS WHY
trainval/xp0O2vi8DX4/50003 FOR EXAMPLE YOU MIGHT TELL YOURSELF
trainval/xp0O2vi8DX4/50004 SO WHAT DO WE SEE
trainval/xp0O2vi8DX4/50005 WHAT YOU DON'T SEE HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED A FEW MONTHS LATER IN THE FINANCIAL COLLAPSE OF 2008 WHEN THE MARKET
trainval/xp0O2vi8DX4/50006 WHAT'S THE POINT ABOUT WORRYING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HAPPEN
trainval/xp0O2vi8DX4/50007 WHAT IS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT YOU WILL SUFFER HEARING LOSS IN YOUR FUTURE
trainval/xp0O2vi8DX4/50008 WE ALL KNOW THAT
trainval/xp0O2vi8DX4/50009 WELL MOST PEOPLE IN A MONOLOGUE WILL SAY BEWARE
trainval/xp0O2vi8DX4/50011 IS JUST GOING TO GET WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE
trainval/xp0O2vi8DX4/50012 LET ME EXPLAIN
trainval/xp0O2vi8DX4/50013 AND IT DOESN'T WORK
trainval/xp0O2vi8DX4/50014 THIS IS AN IMAGE FROM A STUDY THAT WE CONDUCTED LED BY PHD STUDENT MICAH EDELSON AND WHAT IT'S
trainval/xp0O2vi8DX4/50015 AND THE THIRD PRINCIPLE IS PROGRESS MONITORING
trainval/xp0O2vi8DX4/50016 IT MEANS THAT IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE'S ATTENTION YOU MIGHT WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE PROGRESS
trainval/xp0O2vi8DX4/50017 AND HOW WAS IT DOING IT
trainval/xp0O2vi8DX4/50018 LET ME SHOW YOU
trainval/xp0O2vi8DX4/50019 SO IN A HOSPITAL HERE IN THE UNITED STATES A CAMERA WAS INSTALLED TO SEE HOW OFTEN MEDICAL STAFF
trainval/xp0O2vi8DX4/50020 IT'S ONE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF WHAT THE BRAIN IS ACTUALLY DOING
trainval/xP3SW546HYs/50001 WE HAVE TO TRY THAT
trainval/XPa1RE59wpg/50001 WHAT KIND OF IMPACT WOULD THAT HAVE HAD
trainval/XPa1RE59wpg/50002 I REALIZED AS I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF HUMAN NATURE
trainval/XPa1RE59wpg/50003 IT'S WITHIN OUR NATURE TO SEEK STORIES AND INSPIRATIONS
trainval/XPa1RE59wpg/50004 IT'S NO WONDER THAT'S A PART OF WHY WE GIVE
trainval/XPa1RE59wpg/50005 HERE'S THE OTHER PROBLEM WITH THAT
trainval/XPAG3I8P34k/50001 AND ONE DAY AS I WAS IN MY DILEMMA AND IN MY CONFUSION OF THOUGHTS AND EVERYTHING I WAS
trainval/XPAG3I8P34k/50002 AND THERE WAS A SIGN THERE THAT HAD A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS ON IT
trainval/XPAG3I8P34k/50003 I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
trainval/XPAG3I8P34k/50004 NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO YOU DO NOT DESERVE TO BE TREATED WITH DISRESPECT AND
trainval/XPAG3I8P34k/50005 IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S OUT OF MY CONTROL
trainval/XPAG3I8P34k/50006 IT'S SOMETHING THAT I CANNOT FIX AND I ONLY HAVE TWO CHOICES
trainval/XPAG3I8P34k/50008 BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY ABUSE IS JUST ABOUT POWER AND CONTROL
trainval/XPAG3I8P34k/50009 BUT FOR EVERY ONE OF THOSE NEGATIVE MESSAGES I RECEIVE THOUSANDS OF MESSAGES FILLED WITH LOVE
trainval/XPAG3I8P34k/50010 IT CANNOT POSSIBLY HAPPEN TO ME AGAIN
trainval/XPAG3I8P34k/50011 IT CREEPS UP ON YOU
trainval/XPAG3I8P34k/50013 THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
trainval/XPAG3I8P34k/50014 AND THAT'S UNDER REPORTED AND THAT'S ONLY PHYSICAL ABUSE SO THE REAL NUMBER IS MUCH HIGHER
trainval/XPAG3I8P34k/50015 IT'S BETTER IF YOU JUST BRUSH IT UNDER THE RUG KEEP IT BEHIND CLOSED DOORS BURY YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND AND
trainval/XPAG3I8P34k/50016 I HAD A PURPOSE
trainval/XPAG3I8P34k/50017 BECAUSE GUESS WHAT
trainval/XPAG3I8P34k/50018 WE'RE MEANT TO BE IMPERFECT
trainval/XPAG3I8P34k/50019 WE'RE MEANT TO HAVE FLAWS
trainval/XPAG3I8P34k/50020 BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE DESERVE ANY LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED PERCENT RESPECT WHEN WE ARE FLAWED WHEN WE
trainval/XPAG3I8P34k/50021 BUT THERE'S A VERY FINE LINE BETWEEN HEALTHY JEALOUSY AND UNHEALTHY CONTROLLING BEHAVIOUR AND IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO BE AWARE OF
trainval/xPK2Ch90xWo/50001 IT SOUNDS IMPOSSIBLE BUT IN FACT IT WAS QUITE TRUE
trainval/XPkV1bDZDl4/50001 THAT'S MY BACKGROUND
trainval/XPkV1bDZDl4/50002 I WAS AT GREY ADVERTISING FOR TWENTY YEARS
trainval/XPkV1bDZDl4/50003 AND JUST LAST WEEK WE GOT A REQUEST FROM SOMEONE IN ZIMBABWE WHO WANTED TO START A
trainval/XPkV1bDZDl4/50004 SO WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS IDEA THAT RESONATES WITH SO MANY DIFFERENT CULTURES AND
trainval/XPkV1bDZDl4/50005 SO I'M GOING TO DECONSTRUCT THOSE TWO WORDS AND HOPEFULLY DRAW SOME INSIGHTS THAT CAN BE
trainval/XPkV1bDZDl4/50006 SO FIRST THE HISTORY
trainval/XPkV1bDZDl4/50007 AND THAT PATTERN IS THE WEEK
trainval/XPkV1bDZDl4/50008 AND SO THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THE WEEK IS THAT IT'S NOT BASED ON ANY PLANETARY OR
trainval/XPkV1bDZDl4/50009 SO MEATLESS MONDAYS ACTUALLY STARTED AS AN ACCIDENT
trainval/XPkV1bDZDl4/50010 SO WE ALSO HAVE SOME REALLY EXCITING NEW RESEARCH THAT LOOKS AT BIG DATA ANALYSIS OF
trainval/XPkV1bDZDl4/50011 IT'S ALREADY THERE
trainval/XPkV1bDZDl4/50012 AND SO WE WENT TO THE INNOVATORS AND THE LEADERS IN EACH OF THE CATEGORIES OF TYPES OF
trainval/XPkV1bDZDl4/50013 IT HAD REALLY BECOME A TRUE MOVEMENT
trainval/XPkV1bDZDl4/50014 SO IT'S REALLY EASY
trainval/XPkV1bDZDl4/50015 AND I THINK BY DOING THAT YOU CAN JUST DRAW INSPIRATION AND FEEL PART OF A LARGER MOVEMENT THAT
trainval/XPkV1bDZDl4/50016 BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TOGETHER AT SCHOOL AND WORK AT HOME THEY CAN JOIN
trainval/XPkV1bDZDl4/50017 AND I THINK SOMETIMES BY SYNCHRONIZING EVEN SIMPLE ACTIONS WE CAN SYNCHRONIZE OUR
trainval/xpnFeyMGUs8/50001 I ONCE ASKED ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES AT HARVARD HEY IS SOUTH AMERICA PART OF THE WEST
trainval/xpnFeyMGUs8/50002 THAT TELLS YOU SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT
trainval/xpnFeyMGUs8/50003 THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IS REALLY A RELATIVELY SMALL HISTORIC PHENOMENON WHICH HAS JUST ACCELERATED
trainval/xpS7LMLkS5Y/50001 JUST RECENTLY BECAME A HARD CIDER MAKER
trainval/xqPJKtFI42U/50001 BUT ALL OF THOSE RESPONSES ALTHOUGH THEY MAY SEEM VERY INSTINCTIVE DON'T ALWAYS
trainval/xqPJKtFI42U/50002 AND WHEN WE'VE LEARNED TO AUTHENTICALLY IDENTIFY WHAT WE'RE REALLY FEELING AND HOW IT
trainval/xqPJKtFI42U/50003 IT'S ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE AS WELL BECAUSE WHEN WE START TO REALLY UNDERSTAND EMOTION WE CAN START
trainval/xqPJKtFI42U/50005 HIGH EMOTIONALLY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE PERFORM WELL IN THEIR JOBS
trainval/xqPJKtFI42U/50006 THEY'RE HAPPIER IN THEIR JOBS THEY WORK WELL WITH THEIR COLLEAGUES AND THEIR JOB PERFORMANCE IS BETTER THAN LOW EMOTIONALLY
trainval/xqPJKtFI42U/50007 NOW MOST OF THAT EVIDENCE HAS BEEN GATHERED FROM PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES CARRIED OUT USING
trainval/xqPJKtFI42U/50009 I'VE HAD A GO AT THIS AND I CAN TELL YOU IT'S FUN AND REALLY CATHARTIC IF YOU'VE HAD A BAD DAY
trainval/xqPJKtFI42U/50010 AND YOU HAVE TO REGULATE AND CONTROL ANY PREPOTENT RESPONSE TO SAY PUNCH THE NASTY PERSON
trainval/xqPJKtFI42U/50011 EVERYTHING WOULD BE WONDERFUL IF WE WERE ALL EMOTIONALLY INTELLIGENT
trainval/xqPJKtFI42U/50013 WE MAY EVEN BE MARRIED TO ONE
trainval/xqPJKtFI42U/50014 SO THE END JUSTIFIES THE MEANS FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS
trainval/xqPJKtFI42U/50015 AND NEXT TIME YOU GET INTO A CONFLICT SITUATION STOP THINK ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL
trainval/xqPJKtFI42U/50016 BUT IT GETS MUCH MORE INTERESTING
trainval/xqPJKtFI42U/50017 NOW OBVIOUSLY FOR ANYBODY YOU PROBABLY DON'T THINK ABOUT THE PROCESS YOU GO THROUGH BUT THAT INVOLVES A LITTLE BIT
trainval/xQZxGCPjpqM/50001 AND THAT'S TRUE
trainval/xQZxGCPjpqM/50002 AND THIS IS NOT AS FAR FETCHED AS IT SEEMS
trainval/xRL2vVAa47I/50001 NUMBER TWO IS LIFESTYLE
trainval/xRL2vVAa47I/50002 WHY CHOOSY MOMS CHOOSE JIF YOU LOVE YOUR KIDS MORE
trainval/xRL2vVAa47I/50003 NUMBERS TWO AND THREE H AMP M AND INDITEX
trainval/xRL2vVAa47I/50004 WHOSE FAULT IS IT
trainval/xRL2vVAa47I/50005 IT'S OUR FAULT
trainval/xRL2vVAa47I/50006 WE'RE ELECTING REGULATORS WHO DON'T HAVE THE BACKBONE TO ACTUALLY GO AFTER THESE COMPANIES
trainval/xRL2vVAa47I/50007 6 PERCENT WOULDN'T HE DO IT
trainval/xRL2vVAa47I/50008 WE ARE ISSUING 25 CENT PARKING TICKETS ON A METER THAT COSTS 100
trainval/xRL2vVAa47I/50009 YOU'RE A MEDIA COMPANY
trainval/xRL2vVAa47I/50010 THEY'RE SO NICE REMEMBER MICROSOFT
trainval/xRL2vVAa47I/50011 IT SHOULDN'T BE THE IPHONE X IT SHOULD BE CALLED THE IPHONE CROSS
trainval/xRL2vVAa47I/50012 I BELIEVE IT'S BECAUSE THE RATIO OF ONE PERCENT PURSUIT OF SHAREHOLDER VALUE AND 99 PERCENT THE BETTERMENT OF
trainval/xRL2vVAa47I/50013 I KNOW AT LEAST A BIT LARRY PAGE FOR EXAMPLE JEFF BEZOS I DON'T ACTUALLY BELIEVE THEY WAKE UP
trainval/XRWTyUVh0BQ/50001 IT'S BUYING IT
trainval/XRWTyUVh0BQ/50002 TODAY COUNTRIES ARE BOUGHT
trainval/XRWTyUVh0BQ/50003 IT'S JUST LEASING IT
trainval/XRWTyUVh0BQ/50004 THEY THINK MORE IN TERMS OF EMPIRES AND HIERARCHIES USUALLY CHINESE OR JAPANESE
trainval/XRWTyUVh0BQ/50005 AND NOW MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN READING IN THE NEWS HOW PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO CHINA TO LEAD THE REBOUND THE
trainval/XRWTyUVh0BQ/50006 THEY ARE BECOMING PART OF ITS SPHERE OF INFLUENCE
trainval/XRWTyUVh0BQ/50007 JUST TAKE THE BALKANS
trainval/XRWTyUVh0BQ/50008 BUT WHAT ARE THEY GUARDING
trainval/XRWTyUVh0BQ/50009 SINGAPORE FOR EXAMPLE USED TO BAN CHINESE LANGUAGE EDUCATION
trainval/XRWTyUVh0BQ/50010 NOW IT ENCOURAGES IT
trainval/XRWTyUVh0BQ/50011 WELL IF YOU REMEMBER BEFORE WORLD WAR II JAPAN HAD A VISION FOR A GREATER JAPANESE CO PROSPERITY SPHERE
trainval/XRWTyUVh0BQ/50012 NOW LET'S LOOK AT THE ONLY PART OF THE WORLD THAT REALLY HAS BROUGHT DOWN ITS BORDERS AND HOW THAT HAS ENHANCED ITS STRENGTH
trainval/XRWTyUVh0BQ/50013 OF COURSE WE CAN'T FORGET AFRICA
trainval/XRWTyUVh0BQ/50014 WHO WILL WIN
trainval/XRWTyUVh0BQ/50015 THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE CHANGE THOSE BORDERS AND WHAT LINES DO WE FOCUS ON
trainval/XRWTyUVh0BQ/50016 SO WHAT'S NEXT
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50001 WHEN WE ASK OURSELVES WHAT IS IT FOR A SOCIETY OR FOR A WORLD TO BE JUST WE GIVE TOTALLY DIFFERENT
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50002 WE DISAGREE ABOUT JUSTICE
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50003 WE DISAGREE ABOUT THE ROLE OF RELIGION IN POLITICS
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50004 I'VE GOT AN AMAZING JOB
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50005 WHAT SHOULD I DECIDE TO DO
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50006 I'LL SUSPEND JUDGEMENT
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50007 I WONT DO ANYTHING
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50008 MORALITY THEY SAY IS LIKE ICE CREAM
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50009 WE THINK THEY'VE GOTTEN THE TRUTH ABOUT JUSTICE WRONG
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50010 AND I'VE LEARNED SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50011 DEMOCRACY IS SO MUCH MORE THAN VOTING
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50012 AND UNLESS WE DO A BETTER JOB OF DOING THIS OUR POLITICS ISN'T GOING TO BE AS HEALTHY OR AS
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50013 SO WHAT'S ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN TAKING EACH OTHER SERIOUSLY
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50014 PEOPLE OF GOOD FAITH WITH COMPARABLE INTELLIGENCE REASONING AS HARD AS THEY CAN NEVERTHELESS COME TO
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50015 THEY'RE REALLY GOOD ARGUMENTS ON BOTH SIDES
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50016 EVERY YEAR WHEN I TEACH FREE SPEECH I TALK ABOUT A FAMOUS SUPREME COURT CASE FROM THE YEAR
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50017 AND THE QUESTION THE SUPREME COURT NEEDED TO ANSWER WAS
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50018 ON THE OTHER HAND HOW COULD THE NAZIS INVOKE THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM TO JUSTIFY THE EXPRESSION OF A
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50019 WHY SHOULD HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS HAVE TO PUT UP WITH SUCH HATRED SUCH AN ASSAULT ON THEIR EQUAL
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50020 THINK OF PEOPLE WHO OPPOSE INCREASED IMMIGRATION ON THE GROUNDS THAT THEY THINK IT BURDENS NATIVE WORKERS ECONOMICALLY
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50021 THINK ABOUT TRUCK DRIVERS WHO SUPPORT CONSERVATIVE POLITICIANS AND ARE THEN TOLD THEY'VE BEEN BRAINWASHED INTO DOING THAT BY
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50022 I THINK A LOT OF OUR DEBATES ABOUT POLITICS ARE KIND OF LIKE THE DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER FREE SPEECH PROTECTS HATE
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50023 THAT QUESTION IS AMBIGUOUS
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50024 YOU MIGHT MEAN ONE OF TWO THINGS
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50025 YOU MIGHT MEAN
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50026 BUT YOU MIGHT ALSO THINK
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50027 LET'S CALL THE FIRST THE EXPLANATORY PERSPECTIVE
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50028 BUT THE SECOND PERSPECTIVE WE CAN CALL IT THE ARGUMENTATIVE PERSPECTIVE' SEES PEOPLE AS WHAT PHILOSOPHERS CALL
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50029 PEOPLE WHO ARE AUTHORS OF THEIR OWN THOUGHTS WHO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO REFLECT ON WHAT IS RIGHT AND TRUE
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50030 ONLY BY SHIFTING REGISTER INTO THE ARGUMENTATIVE PERSPECTIVE CAN ANYONE BE CONVINCED OF ANYTHING
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50031 THE DISAGREEMENTS I'VE BEEN THINKING OF TODAY ARE DISAGREEMENTS THAT DIVIDE MANY DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50032 THEY'RE DISAGREEMENTS THAT PEOPLE HERE PROBABLY HAVE WITH ONE ANOTHER
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50033 A LOT OF THE DISAGREEMENTS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR DEMOCRACIES ARE DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT THE BEST INTERPRETATION OF A SHARED
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50034 WE ALL WANT JUSTICE EVEN IF WE DISAGREE ABOUT WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50035 AND JUST AS WE WOULD NOT WANT OTHERS TO GIVE UP ON US HAD WE BEEN UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE BEEN BORN INTO
trainval/XS3m37czBfk/50036 AND EVEN THOUGH WE MAY AND OUGHT TO DISAGREE WITH THEM WE SHOULDN'T DO IT FROM A POSTURE OF ARROGANCE
trainval/XS85KAYKOT4/50001 IF IT SANK IT WOULD BE A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY AS FAR AS AN OIL SPILL
trainval/XS85KAYKOT4/50002 IT ALSO MAKES IT VERY VISCOUS
trainval/XS85KAYKOT4/50004 THEY WEREN'T FARMERS THEY WERE JUST GETTING RICH FOR STUFF COMING OUT OF THE GROUND
trainval/XS85KAYKOT4/50005 THERE WERE NO LIPS
trainval/XS85KAYKOT4/50006 GASOLINE COSTS ARE A TREMENDOUS DRAIN ON THE AMERICAN ECONOMY BUT THEY'RE ALSO A DRAIN ON INDIVIDUAL
trainval/XS85KAYKOT4/50007 WE ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO DRIVE MORE
trainval/XSHE4HfaSOY/50001 SO WHAT ARE MICROALGAE
trainval/xSLkNjQyHww/50001 I SAY THAT AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS PIONEERED TRANS MEDIA STORYTELLING
trainval/xSLkNjQyHww/50002 SO TAKING STORIES ACROSS PLATFORMS
trainval/xSLkNjQyHww/50003 BEING EMBARRASSED OF WHO YOU REALLY ARE
trainval/xsU10fX0aC0/50001 HOW NARROW DO YOU ASK
trainval/xsU10fX0aC0/50002 AND WE HAVE THEM HERE TODAY
trainval/xsU10fX0aC0/50003 YOU'RE GOING TO DESICCATE OUT THERE
trainval/xsU10fX0aC0/50004 I LOVE TO STUDY THESE ANIMALS THAT BREAK THE RULES BECAUSE EVERY TIME THEY BREAK A RULE THEY INVENT SOMETHING NEW
trainval/xSUw0NiseBM/50001 THIS PROGRAM IS ABOUT CONNECTING GIRLS WITH GIRLS
trainval/xSUw0NiseBM/50002 OR THE TOOLS OR LANGUAGE TO KNOW WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING
trainval/xSUw0NiseBM/50003 SHE HAS FRIENDS FROM ALL OVER AND DIFFERENT GROUPS NOW BECAUSE SHE KNOWS WHO SHE IS
trainval/xSUw0NiseBM/50004 I DO NOT HAVE ANYBODY TO GO WITH
trainval/xSUw0NiseBM/50005 AND THOSE FIRST FEW STEPS
trainval/XSuZ6ukuz5s/50001 AND THE CURRENCY I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT IS CARBON DIOXIDE
trainval/XSuZ6ukuz5s/50002 AND IT SIMPLY GROWS
trainval/XsvgWEdydDI/50001 IT WAS NOT A PROBLEM FOR THEM BUT IT WAS A PROBLEM FOR ME
trainval/XsvgWEdydDI/50002 IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE A WEIRD WORDING TO YOU BUT I REALLY HOPE BY THE END OF THIS TALK THAT CONSENT IS GOING TO BE A CENTRAL TENET OF HOW YOU
trainval/XsvgWEdydDI/50003 ALL THESE THINGS ARE RELATED IT ALL ABOUT INTERNET RIGHTS
trainval/XsvgWEdydDI/50004 OR WE DECIDE THAT YOU COULD PUBLISH A PICTURE OF A PERSON WITHOUT ASKING THEM
trainval/XsvgWEdydDI/50005 WE NEED TO PUT THE FOCUS ON THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS TO CONSENT
trainval/XsvgWEdydDI/50006 IT IS PEOPLE WHO ARE VICTIMS OF HOMOPHOBIA OR TRANSPHOBIA WHO ARE ALREADY VULNERABLE IN SOCIETY
trainval/XsvgWEdydDI/50007 THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THEIR PRIVACY MOST
trainval/XsvgWEdydDI/50008 WE HEAR THIS TALK OF PRIVACY ALL THE TIME IT'S ALWAYS LIKE OH INTERNET PRIVACY THEY ARE LOOKING UP YOUR PRIVATE
trainval/XsvgWEdydDI/50009 I THINK WE ALL HAVE A PRETTY REGULAR LIFE BUT WE ALL ALSO WANT THE
trainval/XsvgWEdydDI/50010 FOR SOME PEOPLE THEY WOULDN'T MIND BUT I DO MIND
trainval/XsvgWEdydDI/50011 I WE SHIFT THE CONVERSATION TO CONSENT WE MAKE IT MUCH MORE EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING WITH
trainval/XsvgWEdydDI/50012 I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT
trainval/XsvgWEdydDI/50013 CONSENT SHOULD BE OUR FOCUS BECAUSE WE WANT A BETTER WORLD AND WE WANT THE INTERNET TO BE A DRIVER OF A BETTER WORLD
trainval/XsvgWEdydDI/50014 IF WE DON'T FOCUS ON CONSENT IT WILL BE AT THE COST OF POLITICAL DISSIDENTS IT WILL BE AT THE COST OF SEXUAL AND GENDER MINORITIES
trainval/xTBYcSL3MrI/50001 YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO IMAGINE IT
trainval/xTBYcSL3MrI/50002 WE'RE TOLD THERE AREN'T ANY OTHER OPTIONS
trainval/xTBYcSL3MrI/50003 CANADA FOR EXAMPLE HAS AT TIMES PUT HUMAN SECURITY AT THE HEART OF ITS FOREIGN POLICY
trainval/xTBYcSL3MrI/50004 OR HOW WE THINK INTERNATIONALLY FOR THE WIDER WORLD
trainval/xTBYcSL3MrI/50005 BUT WE ALSO NEED TO CHANGE HOW WE THINK ABOUT VULNERABILITY
trainval/xTBYcSL3MrI/50006 BUT THE ONE POINT THAT STAYED WITH ME FROM THAT CONVERSATION WAS MADE BY A JESUIT PRIEST PADRE
trainval/XTf9Sdrq1zg/50001 IT'S POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO BE IN WHITOPIA NOT FOR RACIST REASONS THOUGH IT
trainval/xTMZJvfzxGY/50001 ASTRID'S STORY IS ONE OF CONNECTIONS
trainval/xTMZJvfzxGY/50002 YOU JUST PUT THEM IN QUARANTINE AND OFFER SUPPORTIVE CARE
trainval/xTMZJvfzxGY/50003 IT GOES UNDERGROUND UNTIL IT POPS UP AGAIN MYSTERIOUSLY TO TERRORIZE THE NEXT
trainval/xTMZJvfzxGY/50004 THE AFRICAN DISEASE HAD COME TO US
trainval/xTMZJvfzxGY/50005 AND WHILE IT'S NOT OUR CUSTOM IN THESE COMMUNITIES THE FAMILIES PREPARE THE BODIES FOR DEATH
trainval/xTMZJvfzxGY/50006 SO THE PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY AREN'T EVEN ABLE TO SAY GOODBYE
trainval/xTMZJvfzxGY/50007 YET I SEE HER AS A FRIEND
trainval/xTMZJvfzxGY/50008 WE'RE BOTH ABOUT THE SAME AGE
trainval/xTMZJvfzxGY/50009 WHILE THEY WERE THERE THEY TOURED AN ORPHANAGE AND ASTRID FELT A STRONG CONNECTION TO THE CHILDREN
trainval/xTMZJvfzxGY/50010 SO WHY DO I SAY ASTRID MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGH
trainval/xTMZJvfzxGY/50011 THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT FOR SCIENCE BECAUSE NOW WE HAVE A NATURAL
trainval/xTMZJvfzxGY/50012 MY OUTBREAK BEGAN AND ENDED WITH ME
trainval/xTMZJvfzxGY/50013 THE HOSPITAL PUT OUT A PRESS RELEASE ABOUT MY CASE WHICH LED TO MORE CONNECTIONS
trainval/xTMZJvfzxGY/50014 WELL THIS WEB OF SHARED INTERESTS HAVE ALLOWED PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD TO COME TOGETHER AROUND
trainval/xTMZJvfzxGY/50015 HE HAD LIVED IN AFRICA FOR A WHILE
trainval/xTMZJvfzxGY/50016 HE WAS NOW LEADING A STUDY TO TRY AND FIND A VACCINE FOR MARBURG AND EBOLA
trainval/xTMZJvfzxGY/50017 MARBURG EBOLA SARS THEY'RE NOT GOING AWAY NO MATTER HOW SCARED THEY MAKE US
trainval/xTMZJvfzxGY/50018 IN FACT JUST THIS WEEK THERE WAS ANNOUNCEMENTS ABOUT CASES OF BUBONIC PLAGUE IN COLORADO
trainval/xTMZJvfzxGY/50019 EBOLA WAS JUST A DRY RUN
trainval/xTMZJvfzxGY/50020 AND SOME OF THEM ARE GOING TO BE AMERICANS
trainval/xTMZJvfzxGY/50021 WE NEED TO PRACTICE COMPASSION
trainval/xtRIvS65M4k/50001 I WAS AND STILL AM TERRIFIED OF PUBLIC SPEAKING
trainval/xtRIvS65M4k/50002 I HAD 5000 FOLLOWERS ON POLYVORE AND 9000 COMBINED FOLLOWERS ON TUMBLR
trainval/xtRIvS65M4k/50003 SO WHAT DO I DO ON YOUTUBE
trainval/xuAAPsiD768/50001 LIKE OTHER CMU PRISONERS MCGOWAN REPEATEDLY ASKED FOR AN ANSWER A HEARING OR SOME
trainval/xuAAPsiD768/50002 AND I WAS APPROVED
trainval/xuAAPsiD768/50003 AND THEY SAID THAT IF I ATTEMPTED TO INTERVIEW MCGOWAN THE VISIT WOULD BE TERMINATED
trainval/xuAAPsiD768/50004 WE SPOKE THROUGH THESE HANDSETS ATTACHED TO THE WALL AND TALKED ABOUT BOOKS AND MOVIES
trainval/xuAAPsiD768/50005 THEIR TREATMENT IS A REFLECTION OF THE VALUES HELD BEYOND PRISON WALLS
trainval/xuAAPsiD768/50006 WE DID OUR BEST TO FIND REASONS TO LAUGH
trainval/xuAAPsiD768/50007 HOW COULD THIS POSSIBLY BE HAPPENING
trainval/xuAAPsiD768/50008 AND I THINK THAT'S A REALLY DAMAGING AND DANGEROUS NARRATIVE THAT WE HAVE THAT ALLOWS THESE TYPES OF THINGS TO HAPPEN
trainval/XUW5pfux2IA/50001 THAT'S ONE OF THE ROLES THE UNITED NATIONS CAN PLAY
trainval/XUW5pfux2IA/50002 FOR EXAMPLE IN SUDAN WE WERE ABLE TO GET LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO EXPRESS THEIR
trainval/XUW5pfux2IA/50003 THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE ROLE OF ORGANISATIONS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
trainval/XUW5pfux2IA/50004 TO GET THE VOICES FROM THE FIELD HEARD IN PLACES FAR AWAY SO THOSE CONCERNS DON'T
trainval/Xv2gHiX9Bqw/50001 WE ARE USED TO INVITATIONS BUT THIS INVITATION REALLY THRILLED US
trainval/Xv2gHiX9Bqw/50002 AND PEOPLE DID COMMUNICATE
trainval/Xv2gHiX9Bqw/50003 OVER 15000 MESSAGES WERE SENT
trainval/Xv2gHiX9Bqw/50004 FILES APPEARED ON THE NETWORK INCLUDING CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS LEAKED FROM THE PARLIAMENTARY INVESTIGATION COMMISSION WHICH
trainval/Xv2gHiX9Bqw/50005 WHAT IS NEW IS HOW THESE REALITIES ARE HIDDEN AND HOW PEOPLE ARE MADE INVISIBLE IN AN AGE
trainval/Xv2gHiX9Bqw/50006 SUCH MAKESHIFT SETTLEMENTS ARE CONSIDERED ILLEGAL AND THEREFORE THOSE LIVING IN THEM DON'T HAVE A
trainval/Xv2gHiX9Bqw/50007 BUT THEY AREN'T A COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE
trainval/Xv2gHiX9Bqw/50008 THE RIGHT OF ASSEMBLY AND THE RIGHT TO DEMONSTRATE ARE RESTRICTED THERE
trainval/Xv2gHiX9Bqw/50009 THE SITUATION FOR THE ASYLUM SEEKERS IS MADE WORSE BY CONTRADICTORY POLICIES AND THE TEMPTATION OF
trainval/Xv2gHiX9Bqw/50010 THEY ARE ALL ABOUT PROVIDING BASIC INFORMATION WEATHER FORECASTS LEGAL INFORMATION GUIDANCE
trainval/Xv2gHiX9Bqw/50011 INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET THAT COULD ENSURE SURVIVAL ALONG DANGEROUS ROUTES IS BEING CENSORED AND THE
trainval/Xv2gHiX9Bqw/50012 WE HAVE EUROPEAN PASSPORTS VISAS AND AIR TICKETS
trainval/Xv2gHiX9Bqw/50013 THIS IS ESSENTIAL TO OVERCOME OUR SPEECHLESSNESS AND THE SEPARATION PROVOKED BY RIVAL POLITICAL FORCES
trainval/Xv2gHiX9Bqw/50014 IT IS ONLY IN TRULY EXPOSING OURSELVES TO THE TRANSFORMATIVE POWER OF THIS EXPERIENCE
trainval/xV7IvRT5Qyw/50001 I'M INTERESTED IN WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW
trainval/xV7IvRT5Qyw/50002 IT DEPICTS ACTUALLY THE RESOLUTION THAT WE KNOW MOST OF OUR OCEANS AT
trainval/xV7IvRT5Qyw/50003 THAT MEANS 90 OF OUR OCEAN IS VERY POORLY MAPPED OR SIMPLY
trainval/xV7IvRT5Qyw/50004 THE LAYER OF SAND THAT WE FOUND IS OVER ON THE RIGHT
trainval/xV7IvRT5Qyw/50005 AND THIS IS THE START OF GLACIATION
trainval/xV7IvRT5Qyw/50006 WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS 2
trainval/XvS83nXSf0k/50001 I DON'T LIKE YOU SAYING THE WORD CRAZY' IN THIS CONTEXT
trainval/XvS83nXSf0k/50002 CRAZY' IS A WORD THAT HAS AN OLD MEANING
trainval/XvS83nXSf0k/50003 IT HAS A BAD REPUTATION
trainval/XvS83nXSf0k/50004 THINK ABOUT IT
trainval/XvS83nXSf0k/50005 OR THINK OF THOSE TIMES DURING LIFE CHANGES WHEN YOU MAY BE IN MENOPAUSE OR MIDLIFE OR GOING THROUGH SEPARATION
trainval/XvS83nXSf0k/50006 AND IT'S A PSYCHOLOGICAL SIGNAL
trainval/XvS83nXSf0k/50007 I'M MARRIED TO THE RCMP
trainval/XvS83nXSf0k/50008 HAVE I GOT A CRAZY GOING ON RIGHT NOW
trainval/XvS83nXSf0k/50009 IT'S NOT DEEP
trainval/XvS83nXSf0k/50010 IT MIGHT BE READING AN ARTICLE THAT'S RELEVANT THAT HAS A SUGGESTION IN IT FOR YOU
trainval/XvS83nXSf0k/50011 AND WHEN WE CREATE THESE SMALL CHANGES WHAT WE DO IS WE MOMENTARILY INTERRUPT
trainval/XvS83nXSf0k/50012 I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS ANYMORE
trainval/XvS83nXSf0k/50013 SHE HAD FOUND THE ABILITY TO MANAGE HER CRAZY
trainval/XvS83nXSf0k/50014 SO IT'S BASED ON THE PREMISE OF THINGS LIKE
trainval/XvS83nXSf0k/50015 AND WE RESPECT THAT BECAUSE WE EMBRACE THAT
trainval/XvS83nXSf0k/50016 BECAUSE WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO CREATE THAT CHANGE
trainval/XvS83nXSf0k/50017 AND WHEN WE CREATE ONE CHANGE IT'S GOING TO BECOME CONTAGIOUS
trainval/XvS83nXSf0k/50018 EMBRACE YOUR CRAZY
trainval/XvS83nXSf0k/50019 AND EVERYBODY IS WITH YOU ON IT
trainval/XvS83nXSf0k/50020 MAYBE TRY BUYING A CROSSWORD PUZZLE BOOK
trainval/XvS83nXSf0k/50021 IT MIGHT WORK
trainval/XVXmYD0UPRQ/50001 THE COMPANY WAS BRILLIANT
trainval/XVXmYD0UPRQ/50002 WE HAVE NESTL CREATING NESPRESSO WE HAVE LEGO GOING INTO ANIMATED FILMS
trainval/XVXmYD0UPRQ/50003 BUT WE DON'T ONLY SEE THIS IN COMPANIES
trainval/XVXmYD0UPRQ/50004 WE REALLY DON'T GIVE THEM THE CHANCE
trainval/XVXmYD0UPRQ/50005 EVERYBODY USED THEM
trainval/Xw8U5LXaItM/50001 AND MAYBE THAT WILL LEAD US TO THAT SUSTAINABLE FUTURE THAT WE ALL DREAM ABOUT
trainval/xWVWhSvNLtU/50001 AND I WOULD SAY WITH CONFIDENCE WE DO HAVE ROADS AND WE HAVE INTERNET IN OMAHA NEBRASKA
trainval/xWVWhSvNLtU/50002 WE HAVE THOSE SAME INDIVIDUALS HERE
trainval/xWVWhSvNLtU/50003 THEY WERE FLYING UNDER THE RADAR
trainval/xWVWhSvNLtU/50004 NO I DIDN'T SAY IPHONE I SAID A FLIP CAMERA GOOGLE THAT THEY ARE CIRCA 2006 AND I'D GO
trainval/xWVWhSvNLtU/50005 ONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS IS A NETWORK SCIENTIST BY THE NAME OF RON BURT
trainval/xWVWhSvNLtU/50006 WHAT RON CAME TO FIND WAS THAT NETWORKS AND PEOPLE'S SUCCESS IS DEFINED BY
trainval/xWVWhSvNLtU/50007 I LIKE TO THINK OF MY LIFE AS HOW CAN I SPREAD WARMTH AND GENEROSITY TO EACH AND EVERY PERSON THAT I MEET IN
trainval/xWVWhSvNLtU/50009 THE FIRST FOR THOSE IN THE ROOM THAT MAY BE OVER 25 MAYBE 30 THIS IS WHAT NETWORKING LOOKS LIKE
trainval/XX30i6nC7ro/50001 TOO CONFRONTING IT'S TOO OVERWHELMING
trainval/XX30i6nC7ro/50003 AS THEY DO THIS IS WHEN GREG REALIZES HE'S OUTGROWN THEM
trainval/XX30i6nC7ro/50004 WILL YOU HEAR HOW SELFISH OR CRAZY YOU ARE
trainval/XX30i6nC7ro/50005 YOU'RE RIGHT THERE
trainval/XX30i6nC7ro/50006 THAT'S DECISION THAT'S THE MOMENT
trainval/XX30i6nC7ro/50007 IT'S THE ULTIMATE DRUG
trainval/xx310zM3tLs/50001 NOW PROGRAMMING FOR THOSE OF YOU HERE THAT HAVEN'T DONE IT YOURSELF REQUIRES LAYING OUT IN
trainval/xx310zM3tLs/50002 SO IMPORTANT WAS THIS THAT IN FACT THE SUCCESS WAS COVERED IN THE NEW YORK TIMES IN A FRONT PAGE ARTICLE A FEW WEEKS LATER
trainval/xx310zM3tLs/50003 FOR EXAMPLE THESE FOUR ALGORITHMS WERE ALL BUILT BY THE SAME GUY
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50001 IT HIT ME STRAIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES THAT THIS BOY WOULD NEVER MOVE PROPERLY AGAIN HE WOULD
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50002 JUST BEAR ONE SECOND A FRACTION OF A SECOND FOR HALF YOUR BODY BEING BURNT
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50004 THE SCARS WILL NEVER LEAVE HIM
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50005 WE SEE SUFFERINGS WE SEE LIVES CHANGED IN AN INSTANT AND IT CAN HAPPEN TO ANYONE
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50006 I'M A PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGEON AND FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS I'VE SPENT MY WHOLE
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50007 HOW COULD WE GET BACK TO THAT WHEN IT'S DAMAGED
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50008 THEY'VE GOT TO LOOK AND SEE WHERE ELSE THEY CAN FIND INFORMATION
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50009 AND CERTAINLY IN EMBRYOLOGY AND IN BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES IN GENETICS WE CAN SEE ALL SORTS OF THINGS HAPPENING
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50010 NOW WE MAY STEP BACK FROM THIS AND THINK WOW WHAT IS IT THAT WE DO
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50011 WHEN YOU TREAT SOMEBODY WITH BURNS IT'S A MASSIVE JUGGLING EXERCISE
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50012 WE HAVE THE PAIN WE STILL HAVE INFECTION AS THE BIGGEST KILLER WE HAVE TO SEAL THE SKIN OVER AS THE
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50013 AND WE TRY TO SEAL THAT SURFACE SO ONCE WE GOT THAT SURFACE SEALED WE'RE SAFE
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50014 AND THEN THE HEALING GOES ON AS I'VE DESCRIBED
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50015 BUT IT GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LIFE IF WE CAN SEAL THAT SURFACE WE ARE SAFE AND WE CAN HAVE THAT
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50016 I SEE PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT HAVE CHANGED IN AN INSTANT
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50017 AND SO TRADITIONALLY WHEN I STARTED OVER 30 YEARS AGO WE WOULD TAKE THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN JUST
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50018 BY MESHING IT OUT
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50019 SO HOW WHEN WE GET BIGGER AND BIGGER BURNS WE'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE TECHNOLOGIES ARE ADVANCING WE KNOW THE
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50020 AND I RECENTLY HAD COFFEE WITH A PATIENT I MET IN 1991 1ST OF OCTOBER IN 1991
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50021 HE HAD 92 BODY SURFACE AREA BURNS AND I WAS EXPECTED TO WALK AWAY
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50022 AND I SAID WE DON'T WALK AWAY BECAUSE WE HAVE NOW THE TECHNOLOGY AND 20 YEARS
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50023 SO HOW DID WE ACHIEVE THAT
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50024 WHEN HE ONLY HAD 8 OF HIS BODY LEFT
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50025 WHERE COULD WE GET THE SKIN FROM
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50026 SO WE GREW SKIN CELLS INTO SHEETS
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50027 WHERE DID I START TO THINK THAT WE COULD DO BETTER
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50028 THEY GREW IT INTO SHEETS THAT CAME BACK
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50029 WHY WAIT 3 WEEKS
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50030 PEOPLE DIE WAITING
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50031 AND SO WE STARTED IN THE SKIN LAB IN 1993 AND OUR FIRST SHEETS WE GREW IN 10 DAYS
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50032 AND SO WE STARTED DOING EXPERIMENTS AROUND THIS
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50033 TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50034 SOMEWHAT LESS THAN SUBTLE
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50035 THE TIME TAKEN TO MAKE SURE THOSE CELLS WERE ON THE RIGHT WAY UP FIXING EACH PATCH ONTO
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50036 TAKING IT FROM THERE PUTTING IN A SOUP TRYING TO KEEP THE SOUP UNDER THE DRESSINGS
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50037 AT THAT STAGE YOU GAIN A WHOLE RAFT OF MORE EXPERIMENTS TO DO
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50038 EACH LITTLE CELL CAN COVER MUCH GREATER AREA THAN WHEN WE COALESCE THEM INTO A SHEET
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50039 BUT 5 DAYS IS A LONG TIME
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50040 I'VE SAID ALREADY ONE DAY IN A BURNS UNIT IS A DAY TOO LONG
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50041 AND WE TAKE THAT OUT IT'S LIKE A BREAD AND BUTTER SANDWICH AND WE COULD PEEL THOSE SLICES OF THE SKIN APART
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50042 THOSE CELLS UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS WILL KEEP US WHOLE
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50043 HOW COULD WE STOP THAT
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50044 THAT TOMORROW EVERY MORNING WHEN YOU GET UP IT'S THE START OF A NEW JOURNEY
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50045 SO WHERE TO NOW
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50046 I WOULD GET TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN 20 YEARS MORE NO TROUBLE WE PLANT THE FLAG AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN BUT MY
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50047 BECAUSE AS WE'VE CHANGED THE GOALPOST PEOPLE SURVIVE MORE AND MORE AND MORE MASSIVE INJURIES
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50048 AND WE'RE CHASING THAT ILLUSIVE GOAL FOR MORE COMPLEX SITUATIONS
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50049 AND SO I PUT IT TO YOU
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50050 HOW COULD WE SHORTEN THAT THREE WEEKS
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50051 WHAT CREATE WHAT SELF ORGANIZING SYSTEMS MAKES ME THIS SHAPE
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50052 BUT ESSENTIALLY RECOGNIZABLE THROUGH LIFE
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50053 FROM THE EMBRYO TO DEATH
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50054 WHAT SELF ORGANIZES THIS SYSTEMS
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50055 WELL WE STARTED LOOKING
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50056 WE'VE GOT THE CELLS IN THE PLACE
trainval/xY7kVVS2HVY/50057 IF YOU HEAL A BURN WITHIN 10 DAYS YOU GET A 4 RISK OF SCARRING IF YOU HEAL A BURN WITHIN 21 DAYS
trainval/XYEChpVS04s/50001 SO I THINK THAT WE ARE GETTING BACK TO THAT POINT NOW WITH OUR GENERATION WITH A DIFFERENT
trainval/XYEChpVS04s/50002 LACK OF DIVERSITY
trainval/XYEChpVS04s/50003 STORY BALLETS ARE THE MOST CLASSIC WITHIN THE BALLET REPERTORY
trainval/XYEChpVS04s/50004 SHE DANCED AT THE METROPOLITAN OPERA
trainval/XYEChpVS04s/50005 ARTHUR MITCHELL OF COURSE WAS THE PRINCIPAL DANCER WITH NEW YORK CITY BALLET THE FIRST BLACK MAN
trainval/XYEChpVS04s/50006 DOLORES BROWNE THE NEW YORK NEGRO BALLET IN THE 50S
trainval/XYEChpVS04s/50007 SO I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO KNOW EVERY SIDE OF THE HISTORY OF CLASSICAL
trainval/XYEChpVS04s/50008 FINDING OUT THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE A RICH HISTORY IN THE BALLET WORLD WAS AN INCREDIBLE DISCOVERY FOR ME
trainval/XYEChpVS04s/50009 WHILE STAYING TRUE AND KEEPING THOSE CLASSICS ALIVE WE CAN BUILD AND CREATE NEW CLASSICS AND A BRIGHT FUTURE FOR
trainval/XYEChpVS04s/50010 ALLOWING NEW CHOREOGRAPHERS THE SPACE WITHOUT JUDGEMENT TO CREATE WE COULD VERY WELL HAVE ANOTHER
trainval/XYEChpVS04s/50011 THIS WAS REALLY COOL
trainval/XYEChpVS04s/50012 IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I DID WITH A FORMER NFL PLAYER
trainval/xYemnKEKx0c/50003 HE'S ONLY EVER BEEN MARRIED TWICE
trainval/XzDNfLnUOYY/50001 AND HE SAW IT
trainval/XzDNfLnUOYY/50002 WHAT'S THE NEXT THING TO COME FORWARD
trainval/XzDNfLnUOYY/50003 MOSTLY VERY VERY GREAT WONDERFUL THINGS YOU WOULD SAY THAT'S TERRIFIC
trainval/XzDNfLnUOYY/50004 IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT
trainval/XzDNfLnUOYY/50005 SO THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS VIRUSES IN THE WORLD
trainval/XzDNfLnUOYY/50006 AND SEVERAL DIFFERENT SCIENTIFIC TEAMS WERE WONDERING BUT WHY
trainval/XzDNfLnUOYY/50007 THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS
trainval/XZiNVGA78kA/50001 IT'S ABOUT HOW EAGER WE CAN BE TO LABEL A SITUATION TO PUT CONCRETE AROUND IT BY
trainval/XZiNVGA78kA/50002 THE PARABLE HAS BEEN MY WARNING THAT BY GRIPPING TIGHTLY TO THE STORY OF GOOD OR BAD I
trainval/XZiNVGA78kA/50003 SOME NEVER LEARN TO WALK OR TALK
trainval/XZiNVGA78kA/50004 AT FIVE MONTHS OLD SHE COULD NOT HOLD HER HEAD UP LIKE OTHER BABIES BUT SHE COULD HOLD THIS DEEP INTENT
trainval/XZiNVGA78kA/50005 I WAS REALLY HAPPY WHEN FIONA STARTED USING HER RIGHT HAND TO BULLY A DANGLING STUFFED SHEEP BUT
trainval/XZiNVGA78kA/50006 SO THE THERAPIST SAID WE SHOULD DEVISE A SPLINT WHICH WOULD ROB MY KID OF THE ABILITY TO
trainval/XZiNVGA78kA/50007 I COULD RELEASE MY CULTURAL BIASES ABOUT WHAT MADE A LIFE GOOD OR BAD AND SIMPLY
trainval/XZiNVGA78kA/50008 AT FIRST I THOUGHT SHE'D GOTTEN STUCK THERE BUT THEN I SAW HER REACHING FOR SOMETHING THAT HER EYE
trainval/XZiNVGA78kA/50009 THEY DIDN'T FOCUS ON ALL THAT WAS WRONG WITH MY KID
trainval/XZiNVGA78kA/50010 WE HAIL A BLOCKBUSTER FILM ABOUT A SUICIDAL WHEELCHAIR USER DESPITE THE FACT THAT ACTUAL WHEELCHAIR
trainval/XZiNVGA78kA/50011 AND SOMETIMES OUR MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS DECIDE WHAT LIVES ARE NOT WORTH LIVING
trainval/XZiNVGA78kA/50012 IN 2012 A FAMOUS AMERICAN CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL INITIALLY DENIED AMELIA THE
trainval/XZiNVGA78kA/50013 AND I RECALL HOW BOLD AND HOPEFUL IT FELT EVEN AS SOME OF HER THERAPISTS SAID THAT
trainval/XZiNVGA78kA/50014 I STARTED SEEING THAT WHEN I RELEASED MY GRIP ABOUT WHAT MADE A LIFE GOOD OR BAD I COULD
trainval/XzNLfw5lS4A/50001 THIS IS NOT HOW IT WORKS
trainval/XzNLfw5lS4A/50002 AND WHAT CAN A CARTOONIST DO
trainval/xzT6iH2CX4k/50001 IT IS THE MODEL FOR ALL FUTURE RELATIONSHIPS WITH FRIENDS WITH PARTNERS AND WITH THEIR OWN
trainval/xzT6iH2CX4k/50002 AND IT'S ONLY WHEN IT GOES WRONG THAT WE START TO REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF FAMILIES TO CHILDREN
trainval/xzT6iH2CX4k/50003 IN AUGUST 1993 I HAD MY FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO WITNESS ON A MASSIVE SCALE
trainval/xzT6iH2CX4k/50004 YET I COULD SEE SOILED NAPPIES AND I COULD SEE THAT SOME OF THE CHILDREN WERE DISTRESSED BUT THE ONLY NOISE WAS A LOW
trainval/xzT6iH2CX4k/50005 THE NEWLY ADMITTED BABIES WOULD CRY FOR THE FIRST FEW HOURS BUT THEIR DEMANDS WERE NOT MET AND SO EVENTUALLY THEY LEARNED NOT
trainval/xzT6iH2CX4k/50006 THEY ARE OFTEN HUNGRY
trainval/xzT6iH2CX4k/50007 AND INSTEAD OF BEING PROVIDED WITH POSITIVE MESSAGES ABOUT THEIR CHILD'S POTENTIAL ARE TOLD BY THE DOCTORS
trainval/xzT6iH2CX4k/50008 IN MOLDOVA DESPITE EXTREME POVERTY AND THE TERRIBLE EFFECTS OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS
trainval/xzT6iH2CX4k/50009 AWARENESS RAISING IS REQUIRED AT EVERY LEVEL OF SOCIETY
trainval/Y0UB6g8Rsyw/50001 AND THE OPERATING SYSTEM NEEDS TO KEEP UP
trainval/Y0UB6g8Rsyw/50002 AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMEONE ARBITRATE THAT
trainval/Y0UB6g8Rsyw/50003 AND INDEED THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
trainval/Y0UB6g8Rsyw/50004 AND FIVE OR TEN YEARS FROM NOW WHEN AMAZON WANTS TO DELIVER A PACKAGE OVER YOUR HOUSE TO YOUR NEIGHBOR FROM
trainval/Y0UB6g8Rsyw/50005 WHERE DOES IT END
trainval/Y0UB6g8Rsyw/50006 AND THERE IS NO IDEOLOGY THAT WILL TELL YOU WHERE YOUR PROPERTY ENDS
trainval/Y0UB6g8Rsyw/50007 AND THIS IS WHY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO THINK OF AMERICAN CAPITALISM AS AN OPERATING SYSTEM AND NOT AS AN
trainval/Y0UB6g8Rsyw/50008 AND I'M HERE TO ARGUE THAT THIS IS BECAUSE CAPITALISM IN THE MODERN ITERATION IS LARGELY
trainval/y1GqNN2Xe7g/50001 AND HE ACTUALLY CAME UP WITH THIS CONCEPT OF RESONANT ENERGY TRANSFER
trainval/y1GqNN2Xe7g/50002 IT RUNS THE ANDROID OPERATING SYSTEM
trainval/y1GqNN2Xe7g/50003 I THINK I HEARD SOMEBODY TALK ABOUT THAT BEFORE
trainval/y1GqNN2Xe7g/50004 THEY COULD GO ACTUALLY UNDERNEATH YOUR DESKTOP
trainval/Y28ARjfk4gg/50001 BUT I'M HERE TO DISPEL MYTHS ABOUT BIRDING AND TO SHOW YOU HOW YOU TOO CAN JOIN IN
trainval/Y28ARjfk4gg/50002 IF YOU WANT TO SEE A SNOWY OWL MY FAVORITE BIRD WHEN GROWING UP IF YOU WANT TO SEE A SNOWY OWL HEAD UP TO
trainval/Y28ARjfk4gg/50003 ONE OF THE MOST COMMON BIRDS
trainval/Y28ARjfk4gg/50004 ODD LITTLE FACT
trainval/y2X7c9TUQJ8/50001 NO WORK DADDY
trainval/y2X7c9TUQJ8/50002 WHAT I REALIZED IN THAT MOMENT FROM A 2 YEAR OLD IS THAT TODAY TIME MANAGEMENT IS NO LONGER JUST
trainval/y2X7c9TUQJ8/50003 SO THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS TIME MANAGEMENT
trainval/y2X7c9TUQJ8/50004 I FEEL LIKE IT WAS PRETTY MUCH SINGLE HANDEDLY USHERED IN BY THE LATE GREAT DR
trainval/y2X7c9TUQJ8/50005 HOW DOES IT FEEL TO KNOW THAT REALLY ALL WE ARE IS A BUNCH OF JUGGLING HAMSTERS SPRINTING TOWARDS AN INEVITABLE CRASH
trainval/y2X7c9TUQJ8/50006 WHAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I CAN DO TODAY
trainval/y2X7c9TUQJ8/50007 BUT A MULTIPLIER REALIZES THAT IF I SAVE 30 MINUTES A MONTH FROM PAYING MY BILLS BY SETTING UP ONLINE BILL
trainval/y2X7c9TUQJ8/50008 I HAD BEEN STUDYING MARTIAL ARTS SINCE I WAS 5
trainval/y2X7c9TUQJ8/50009 ANOTHER GENTLEMAN WHO WALKED IN IT WAS HIS FIRST DAY ALSO
trainval/y2X7c9TUQJ8/50010 WE ADVANCED THROUGH THE BELT LEVELS TOGETHER AND SO KEVIN STARTED BRINGING ME HOME FROM CLASS EVERY ONCE IN
trainval/y2X7c9TUQJ8/50011 SOON KEVIN CAME OVER ON THE WEEKENDS AND WE WOULD PRACTICE OUR FORMS
trainval/y2X7c9TUQJ8/50012 YOU MULTIPLY TIME BY GIVING YOURSELF THE EMOTIONAL PERMISSION TO SPEND TIME ON THINGS TODAY THAT CREATE MORE TIME TOMORROW
trainval/y2X7c9TUQJ8/50013 A COUPLE OF YEARS AFTER THAT KEVIN ADOPTED ME AND I CHANGE MY LAST NAME FROM RORY MACLACHLAN TO RORY VADEN AND THEY
trainval/y2X7c9TUQJ8/50014 HOWEVER IF YOU ASK THE QUESTION
trainval/y2X7c9TUQJ8/50015 IT'S WHY SOME PEOPLE CREATE EXTRAORDINARY EXPLOSIVE EXPONENTIAL RESULTS AND OTHER PEOPLE
trainval/y2X7c9TUQJ8/50016 PROCRASTINATION IS THE FOUNDATION OF ALL MEDIOCRITY
trainval/y2X7c9TUQJ8/50017 WAITING TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE WE'RE DECIDING THAT NOW IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME THAT ISN'T PROCRASTINATION
trainval/y2X7c9TUQJ8/50018 LIKE CHECKING EMAIL 24 HOURS A DAY 7 DAYS A WEEK
trainval/y2X7c9TUQJ8/50019 AND WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT IF SOMETHING CAN CONTINUALLY WAIT OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU DEVELOP THE COURAGE TO DO WHAT YOU
trainval/y2X7c9TUQJ8/50020 OR SOMEONE RISES UP TO THE CALL OF LEADERSHIP
trainval/y2X7c9TUQJ8/50021 WELL RORY WAIT A MINUTE IN THE TAKE THE STAIRS BOOK YOU SAID
trainval/Y2y7BzjbSNo/50001 I MEAN THAT'S SO COOL
trainval/Y2y7BzjbSNo/50002 AND HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT WORKS IF WE CAN'T TRUST RESEARCH
trainval/y2yka9lyvMA/50001 I DIDN'T KNOW IF I WAS GOING TO MAKE IT THIS WAS ONLY 12
trainval/y2yka9lyvMA/50002 SO DON'T EVER GIVE UP ON YOURSELF
trainval/y2yka9lyvMA/50003 I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO HELP SOLVE PROBLEMS
trainval/y2yka9lyvMA/50004 I THINK THEY HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO DO IT
trainval/Y350oOiunf4/50001 BUT WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO UNDERSTAND IT
trainval/Y350oOiunf4/50002 THERE IS SOMETHING THAT MADE IT THAT WAY
trainval/Y350oOiunf4/50003 IN BOLTZMANN'S SCENARIO IF YOU WANT TO MAKE AN APPLE PIE YOU JUST WAIT FOR THE RANDOM MOTION OF ATOMS TO MAKE YOU AN
trainval/y3jYVe1RGaU/50001 I'M NOT SAYING THEY'RE BROKEN
trainval/y3jYVe1RGaU/50003 IT WAS THREE FEET OFF THE GROUND AND THEY SAID WHAT IS THIS
trainval/y3jYVe1RGaU/50005 I SAID IF YOU WISH TO
trainval/y3jYVe1RGaU/50006 AND I WENT AWAY
trainval/y3jYVe1RGaU/50007 I WENT 300 MILES OUT OF DELHI INTO A REALLY REMOTE VILLAGE WHERE THE CHANCES OF A PASSING SOFTWARE
trainval/y3jYVe1RGaU/50008 AND THEY SAID SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING TO ME
trainval/y3jYVe1RGaU/50009 I GOT 200 IN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS
trainval/y3jYVe1RGaU/50010 WHERE DOES IT STOP
trainval/y3jYVe1RGaU/50011 THEY'LL GET A ZERO
trainval/y3jYVe1RGaU/50012 I FOUND A VILLAGE
trainval/y3jYVe1RGaU/50013 SO BY NOW I HAD DEVELOPED A NEW PEDAGOGICAL METHOD SO I APPLIED THAT
trainval/y3jYVe1RGaU/50014 I SAID I HAVEN'T THE FOGGIEST IDEA
trainval/y3jYVe1RGaU/50015 IT'S ABOUT LETTING IT HAPPEN
trainval/y3jYVe1RGaU/50016 BUT HOW WILL WE KNOW
trainval/y3jYVe1RGaU/50017 HOW WILL WE COME TO KNOW
trainval/y3jYVe1RGaU/50018 THE LIGHTS ARE TURNED ON AND OFF BY THE CLOUD ETC
trainval/y3jYVe1RGaU/50019 EVERYTHING'S DONE FROM THE CLOUD
trainval/y3jYVe1RGaU/50020 THERE'S A GREAT DOCUMENT PRODUCED BY TED WHICH TELLS YOU HOW TO DO IT
trainval/y3jYVe1RGaU/50021 THAT'S MY WISH
trainval/y3jYVe1RGaU/50022 AND JUST ONE LAST THING
trainval/y3ZrjRlIcgI/50001 PARENTS AND EDUCATORS ARE ALSO RESPONDING TO SEXTING WITHOUT REALLY THINKING TOO MUCH ABOUT
trainval/y3ZrjRlIcgI/50002 IT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE WORRYING ABOUT NOW WITH SOCIAL MEDIA AND DRONE CAMERAS AND OF COURSE
trainval/y3ZrjRlIcgI/50003 WE COULD DESIGN THE CAR TO MAKE IT SAFER
trainval/y3ZrjRlIcgI/50004 SO IN THE 1920S WE GOT SHATTER RESISTANT WINDSHIELDS IN THE 1950S SEAT BELTS
trainval/y3ZrjRlIcgI/50005 THIS IDEA OF AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT COMES FROM ANTI RAPE ACTIVISTS WHO TELL US THAT WE
trainval/y3ZrjRlIcgI/50006 WE DO THIS KIND OF THING ALL THE TIME TO PROTECT COPYRIGHT
trainval/y3ZrjRlIcgI/50007 IF YOU BUY AN E BOOK YOU CAN'T JUST SEND IT OUT TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU WANT SO WHY NOT TRY
trainval/y3ZrjRlIcgI/50008 THEY CALLED HER A SLUT AND A WHORE AND THEY MADE HER LIFE MISERABLE
trainval/Y4QZzZgYUKg/50001 IT CAN NOT FEED THE WORLD FOR ONE
trainval/Y4xCpqVaS6I/50001 IT'S QUITE TASTY
trainval/Y4xCpqVaS6I/50002 SO RATHER THAN HAVING 10 OYSTERS YOU HAVE 10000 OYSTERS
trainval/Y5M7e0PWFtk/50001 IF TWO PACKS OF EQUAL SIZE MEET THE PACK WITH THE OLD WOLF WINS 2
trainval/y62pJTJkfbg/50001 BUT DON'T FRET THERE ARE RESOURCES FOR ALL THESE THINGS
trainval/y62pJTJkfbg/50002 IF YOU GO TO TED
trainval/y62pJTJkfbg/50003 SO IT'S A NICE THING TO HAVE
trainval/y66YKWzSsf0/50001 FIRST QUESTION TO ANSWER FOR US SO WHAT
trainval/y66YKWzSsf0/50002 THOSE ARE WAYS TO ENGAGE AND EXCITE US ABOUT YOUR CONTENT
trainval/y6FT80ZoVJY/50001 AND INTERVAL RESEARCH IS KIND OF THE LIVING EXAMPLE OF HOW THAT CAN BE TRUE
trainval/y6FT80ZoVJY/50002 SO DAVID AND I DECIDED TO GO FIND OUT THROUGH THE BEST RESEARCH WE COULD MUSTER WHAT IT WOULD
trainval/y6FT80ZoVJY/50003 WE SPENT TWO AND A HALF YEARS CONDUCTING RESEARCH WE SPENT ANOTHER YEAR AND A HALF IN ADVANCE DEVELOPMENT
trainval/y6FT80ZoVJY/50004 IN THE RESEARCH PHASE OF THE PROJECT AT INTERVAL WE PARTNERED WITH A COMPANY CALLED
trainval/y6FT80ZoVJY/50006 THANK YOU FRANS DE WAAL WHEREVER YOU ARE I LOVE YOU AND I'D GIVE ANYTHING TO MEET YOU
trainval/y6FT80ZoVJY/50007 AFTER WE HAD DONE THAT WITH A PRETTY LARGE TEAM OF PEOPLE AND DISCOVERED WHAT WE THOUGHT THE SALIENT ISSUES WERE
trainval/y6FT80ZoVJY/50008 WHO ARE MY FRIENDS
trainval/y6FT80ZoVJY/50009 TO EXERCISE THE LOVE OF SOCIAL COMPLEXITY AND THE NARRATIVE INTELLIGENCE THAT DRIVES MOST OF THEIR
trainval/y6FT80ZoVJY/50010 THE OTHER TITLE THAT WE LAUNCHED IS CALLED SECRET PATHS IN THE FOREST WHICH ADDRESSES THE MORE FANTASY ORIENTED INNER LIVES OF
trainval/Y6U728AZnV0/50001 BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT EXERCISE WAS THE BEST THING FOR MY HEART AND I
trainval/Y6U728AZnV0/50002 THE HERO OF THIS STORY IS A GUY NAMED MICAH TRUE
trainval/y7A4dZIyI0g/50001 AND THAT RESULTS IN DIFFERENT CULTURE AND COMPLEX SOCIAL STRUCTURE IN DIFFERENT DOLPHIN
trainval/y7A4dZIyI0g/50002 FOR AN EXTREMELY ACOUSTIC ANIMAL LIKE DOLPHINS LONG TIME EXPOSURE TO NOISE WILL RESULT IN
trainval/y7l5QHRYSAI/50001 IT'S ABOUT MUTUAL FUNDS
trainval/y7l5QHRYSAI/50002 IT'S ABOUT ALL THE THINGS WE ALREADY SEE IN THE MARKET TODAY
trainval/y7LXwGfvxwo/50001 AND IN FACT TO SOME EXTENT YOU'RE RIGHT
trainval/y7LXwGfvxwo/50002 THEY'RE STUDYING HUMAN DISEASE AND OTHER IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF SCIENCE
trainval/y7LXwGfvxwo/50003 SO THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD RESEARCH GOING ON WITH CRISPR
trainval/y7LXwGfvxwo/50004 IT'S A TOUGH QUESTION
trainval/y7LXwGfvxwo/50005 WHAT IS BETTER WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A HUMAN BEING
trainval/y7LXwGfvxwo/50006 AND SO I HOPE AT THESE MEETINGS THAT THERE WILL BE A ROLE FOR THE PUBLIC TO BRING THEIR VOICE TO BEAR AS
trainval/Y7QaqazOvSA/50001 I'M AN ULTRA DISTANCE TRAIL RUNNER
trainval/Y7QaqazOvSA/50002 AND THAT UNKNOWN IS PRETTY AMAZING
trainval/Y7QaqazOvSA/50004 AND WE RAN REALLY WELL FOR THE NEXT 10 MILES AND THEN THE REALITY OF WHAT I'D DONE TO MYSELF SET IN
trainval/Y7QaqazOvSA/50005 AND THOSE LAST 10 MILES I'D TOLD HER BEFORE DON'T LISTEN TO ME ANYTHING YOU I TELL YOU YOU TELL ME TO RUN
trainval/Y7QaqazOvSA/50006 AND THEN WHEN I BUILD ON TOP OF THAT I'M ABLE TO DO THAT MUCH MORE
trainval/Y7QaqazOvSA/50007 AND WHEN WE HIT THE BOTTOM OF THE TRAIL AND THE TRAIL OPENED UP TO THE ROAD AND I COULD SEE THE SHOPS OF CHAMONIX
trainval/Y7QaqazOvSA/50008 I KEPT GOING WITH THEM SO I SAW HOW I REACT IN THE WORLD
trainval/y8qc8Aa3weE/50001 I'VE KNOWN I WANTED TO BE A DOCTOR FROM AGE EIGHT
trainval/y8qc8Aa3weE/50002 THEY WENT INTO THE HOMES OF 42 FAMILIES AND THEY HAD AN INTENSE OBSERVATION
trainval/y8qc8Aa3weE/50003 OH YOUR DIAPER NEEDS TO BE CHANGED
trainval/y8qc8Aa3weE/50004 OH BLESS YOUR HEART I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT
trainval/y8qc8Aa3weE/50005 OH LOOK AT THOSE TOES
trainval/y8qc8Aa3weE/50006 YOU MAY NEVER CATCH UP
trainval/y8qc8Aa3weE/50007 IT INVOLVES UNITED WAY IT INVOLVES THE ANNE E
trainval/y8qc8Aa3weE/50008 IN WIC YOU DON'T JUST GET A LITTLE PLASTIC CARD AND GO TO THE GROCERY STORE AND DO WHATEVER YOU WANT
trainval/y8qc8Aa3weE/50009 SO FAR WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT WORKS
trainval/y8qc8Aa3weE/50010 I BELIEVE IT'LL WORK BUT WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW IS DOES IT REALLY WORK
trainval/y8qc8Aa3weE/50011 LANGUAGE IS THE VERY BASIS OF SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF POVERTY
trainval/y8qc8Aa3weE/50012 AND ALL THOSE LOW RISK MOTHERS
trainval/y8qc8Aa3weE/50013 WE HAVE A WIC OFFICE CAPABLE OF REACHING THESE PEOPLE
trainval/Y8wol2nGSpY/50002 WE DON'T HAVE TO GUESS OR USE OUR GUTS WE CAN USE SOCIAL SCIENCE
trainval/y8ZMviYx9aY/50001 IT COSTS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR TO EDUCATE CHILDREN
trainval/y8ZMviYx9aY/50002 ELEPHANTS ARE ON THE VERGE OF EXTINCTION ON TWO CONTINENTS
trainval/y8ZMviYx9aY/50003 AFRICA AND ASIA
trainval/y8ZMviYx9aY/50004 WE'VE GOT TO COME UP WITH UNIQUE WAYS TO TRY AND SAVE ELEPHANTS
trainval/y8ZMviYx9aY/50005 ONE WAY WE CAN DO THAT IS TO TRY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THEM
trainval/y9ALB39wRKo/50001 WE REALLY COULD SENSE THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A MAJOR PROGRESSIVE CHANGE IN GREECE
trainval/y9ALB39wRKo/50002 OUR DEMOCRACIES ARE WEAKENED IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY WITH PLAYERS THAT CAN EVADE LAWS EVADE TAXES
trainval/y9ALB39wRKo/50003 YET I HAVE COME TO BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEM IS NOT SO MUCH ONE OF ECONOMICS AS IT IS ONE OF
trainval/y9ALB39wRKo/50004 LET'S NOT BE
trainval/Y9DsAmzNkWk/50001 THE REAL NUMBER IS LIKELY DOUBLE THAT
trainval/Y9DsAmzNkWk/50002 THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT TRANSFORMED ME FROM A MEDIEVAL SCHOLAR A READER OF TEXTS INTO A
trainval/Y9DsAmzNkWk/50004 TO MAKE THE FIRST TRANSCRIPTION OF THIS MANUSCRIPT IN 250 YEARS
trainval/Y9DsAmzNkWk/50005 THROUGH THIS LENS WE WITNESSED THE MISTAKES THE CHANGES OF MIND THE NAIVETES YOUNG CENSORED
trainval/Y9DsAmzNkWk/50006 IN THAT MOMENT HE BECAME A SCHOLAR
trainval/Y9DsAmzNkWk/50007 THAT MEANS THAT MOUNTING RECOVERIES IS BEYOND THE REACH OF MOST RESEARCHERS AND ALL BUT THE WEALTHIEST INSTITUTIONS
trainval/y9Trdafp83U/50001 BUT SOME GROUPS AND RELATIONSHIPS DELIVER A CHEAP FORM OF BELONGING YOU'RE VALUED FOR WHAT YOU
trainval/y9Trdafp83U/50002 EACH MORNING MY FRIEND JONATHAN BUYS A NEWSPAPER FROM THE SAME STREET VENDOR IN NEW YORK
trainval/y9Trdafp83U/50003 I'LL WALK BY SOMEONE I KNOW AND BARELY ACKNOWLEDGE THEM
trainval/y9Trdafp83U/50004 THEY MAKE THEM FEEL INVISIBLE AND UNWORTHY
trainval/y9Trdafp83U/50005 I MET A YOUNG MAN NAMED EMEKA WHO'D BEEN PARALYZED PLAYING FOOTBALL
trainval/y9Trdafp83U/50006 I PARTIED A LOT AND WAS A PRETTY SELFISH GUY
trainval/y9Trdafp83U/50007 BUT IT GAVE THEM A PURPOSE TO REIN IN THE EGO
trainval/y9Trdafp83U/50008 AND I STARTED SEARCHING FOR THOSE THINGS THAT MAKE LIFE WORTH LIVING
trainval/y9Trdafp83U/50009 LOOKING BACK I NOW REALIZE THAT THE SUFI HOUSE HAD A REAL CULTURE OF MEANING
trainval/y9Trdafp83U/50010 IT'S AN ONGOING PROCESS
trainval/y9Trdafp83U/50011 AS EACH DAY GOES BY WE'RE CONSTANTLY CREATING OUR LIVES ADDING TO OUR STORY
trainval/y9wzaxSPtIo/50001 YOU CHANGE ITS ENVIRONMENT AND THE OBJECT WILL FLOW
trainval/y9wzaxSPtIo/50002 IT UPLOADS A PICTURE AND THE REASON WHY IT CHOSE THAT CAKE FOR YOU TO OUR FACEBOOK PAGE
trainval/yA9xQB547Yo/50001 AS I DROVE HOME THAT NIGHT I CRIED
trainval/yA9xQB547Yo/50002 I CRIED BECAUSE I RECOGNIZED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT HOMELESSNESS IS NOT JUST ABOUT A LACK OF HOUSING
trainval/yA9xQB547Yo/50003 DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE WAKES UP IN VANCOUVER'S ALLEYWAYS IT'S NOTHING COMPARED TO THE HELL HE ENDURED IN
trainval/yA9xQB547Yo/50004 SO MUCH SO THAT SHE WROTE TO DR GABOR MAT TO THANK HIM
trainval/yA9xQB547Yo/50005 HE IS MY DOCTOR
trainval/yA9xQB547Yo/50006 IN THE BOOK MY NAME IS CELIA
trainval/Yagdvqn2YMU/50001 THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR
trainval/Yagdvqn2YMU/50002 I WANT TO GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES
trainval/Yagdvqn2YMU/50003 NOTICE THEY WERE CARRYING MUTATIONS FROM BIRTH THAT WERE PROTECTIVE THAT WERE PROTECTING THEM FROM GOING ON TO
trainval/Yagdvqn2YMU/50004 I WOULD BE WILLING TO PARTICIPATE
trainval/Yagdvqn2YMU/50005 AM I GOING TO OWN IT
trainval/Yagdvqn2YMU/50006 WE NEED A SWAB OF DNA AND A WILLINGNESS TO SAY WHAT'S INSIDE ME
trainval/Yagdvqn2YMU/50007 AND INSTEAD OF BEING 20000 OR 30000 LAST MONTH WE PASSED ONE HALF MILLION
trainval/YATYsgi3e5A/50001 SO LET'S TALK ABOUT SUPERBUGS FOR A MOMENT
trainval/YATYsgi3e5A/50002 IT'S A WAR ON SUPERBUGS
trainval/YATYsgi3e5A/50003 AND OF COURSE WE WANT TO STERILIZE MOSTLY WHEN THERE ARE PEOPLE AROUND
trainval/YATYsgi3e5A/50004 THIS IS POTENTIALLY SUCH IMPORTANT WORK
trainval/YATYsgi3e5A/50005 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING THIS WITH US
trainval/YAV96XSdMQo/50001 GALAXIES ARE INCREDIBLY HUGE
trainval/YAV96XSdMQo/50002 IF YOU GO AT THAT SPEED FOR ONE YEAR YOU COVER ABOUT 6 TRILLION MILES
trainval/YAV96XSdMQo/50003 100000 TIMES 6 TRILLION MILES
trainval/YAV96XSdMQo/50004 WE LIVE IN A GALAXY VERY MUCH LIKE THIS CALLED THE MILKY WAY
trainval/YAV96XSdMQo/50005 RIGHT NOW THIS ROOM AND THIS PLANET AND THIS WHOLE SOLAR SYSTEM IS MOVING AT ABOUT HALF A
trainval/YAV96XSdMQo/50006 THIS IS A PICTURE OF THE NEAREST LARGE GALAXY TO US THE ANDROMEDA GALAXY
trainval/YAV96XSdMQo/50007 7 BILLION YEARS AGO IT'S VERY DIFFERENT INDEED
trainval/YAV96XSdMQo/50008 WE CAN LOOK BACK TO A TIME WHEN THERE WAS NOTHING BUT HYDROGEN GAS
trainval/YAV96XSdMQo/50009 THE UNIVERSE IS SOMEHOW VERY DIFFERENT
trainval/YAV96XSdMQo/50010 SO WHAT HAPPENED
trainval/YAV96XSdMQo/50011 WHAT HAPPENED TO CHANGE THE UNIVERSE THIS WAY
trainval/YAV96XSdMQo/50012 THE STAR GETS ENERGY OUT OF THAT AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE STAR SHINE
trainval/YAV96XSdMQo/50013 STARS ARE AMAZING THINGS
trainval/YAV96XSdMQo/50014 YOU CAN BARELY SEE IT
trainval/YAV96XSdMQo/50015 STARS LIKE THE SUN UNRAVEL GENTLY BACK INTO SPACE
trainval/YAV96XSdMQo/50016 I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT STORY BECAUSE I NEVER RESPONDED TO SCIENCE JUST AS THE MATHEMATICS JUST AS THE
trainval/YAV96XSdMQo/50017 I RESPONDED TO THE STORY AND TO THE DRAMA OF IT ALL
trainval/YAV96XSdMQo/50018 WE COME FROM THE STARS LITERALLY
trainval/YAV96XSdMQo/50019 IT'S RIGHT HERE INSIDE YOU
trainval/YAV96XSdMQo/50020 IT'S NOT JUST A SINGLE STAR EITHER
trainval/YAV96XSdMQo/50021 THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I FEEL SUCH EXULTANT JOY
trainval/YAV96XSdMQo/50022 I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW BEAUTIFUL THIS IS THE SYSTEM THAT I'M A PART OF
trainval/YAV96XSdMQo/50023 MY ATOMS COME TOGETHER FOR A LITTLE WHILE
trainval/YAV96XSdMQo/50024 THERE'S NEVER BEEN SOMETHING QUITE LIKE ME OR LIKE YOU
trainval/yBdyFKqwKy0/50001 ITS THICK ATMOSPHERE NOT ITS DISTANCE FROM THE SUN IS THE REASON
trainval/YbtrDM1aJF0/50001 POETRY IS THE ART OF TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING WITH WORDS THAT CANNOT BE SAID IN WORDS
trainval/ycB29FkoylE/50001 BUT WHAT REALLY TOUCHED ME THE MOST ABOUT THEM AS I WAS LEARNING ABOUT THEIR BEHAVIOR IS THAT EVEN IN
trainval/ycB29FkoylE/50002 A THREE METER LONG SHARK A GREAT WHITE SHARK
trainval/ycB29FkoylE/50003 I REMEMBER THAT DAY
trainval/ycB29FkoylE/50004 WE GOT HALFWAY THERE AND WORKING WITH ANIMAL WELFARE ORGANIZATIONS WHO POSTED INFORMATION ABOUT MY CAMPAIGN ON THEIR WEBSITES
trainval/Ydj28CDrHV4/50001 WHEN I DRAW WITH MY LEFT HAND IT IS A KIND OF CONVERSATION WITH MYSELF EXPLORING THE
trainval/Ydj28CDrHV4/50002 ENJOY HAVE A NICE DAY
trainval/ydKcaIE6O1k/50001 WHAT THEY SUBSEQUENTLY DISCOVERED COMPLETELY BLEW MY MIND
trainval/ydKcaIE6O1k/50002 IT GETS SLOWER AND SLOWER MAKING ERRORS
trainval/ydKcaIE6O1k/50003 BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH
trainval/ydKcaIE6O1k/50004 EVELYN FORGET DISCOVERED THAT THE PEOPLE IN DAUPHIN HAD NOT ONLY BECOME RICHER BUT ALSO SMARTER AND HEALTHIER
trainval/ydKcaIE6O1k/50005 WE ALSO NEED TO BE FOR SOMETHING
trainval/ydKcaIE6O1k/50006 HERE WE ARE
trainval/ydKcaIE6O1k/50007 WE'VE GOT THE RESEARCH WE'VE GOT THE EVIDENCE AND WE'VE GOT THE MEANS
trainval/ydKcaIE6O1k/50008 NOW MORE THAN 500 YEARS AFTER THOMAS MORE FIRST WROTE ABOUT A BASIC INCOME AND 100 YEARS AFTER GEORGE ORWELL
trainval/yDpnTrF9N6w/50001 CLEARLY SOMETHING IMPORTANT IS GOING ON
trainval/yDpnTrF9N6w/50002 BUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO FIRST IS GIVE YOU A TASTE OF THE OPENING NUMBER
trainval/YdSSA7POsN0/50001 WE BOUGHT THAT T SHIRT WE DANCED THAT DANCE
trainval/yDubrSRjlCE/50001 I KNEW EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY OF THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD
trainval/yDubrSRjlCE/50002 THAT'S A TRICK QUESTION
trainval/yDubrSRjlCE/50003 WITH NO OTHER OPTION I GRABBED MY BICYCLE AND I STARTED PEDALLING
trainval/yDubrSRjlCE/50004 ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE WAS MORE TO MY PATH THAN A BEGINNING AND AN END
trainval/yDubrSRjlCE/50005 BUT BACK ON TWO WHEELS AT ABOUT 10 MPH I BROKE BACK INTO THE SPEED OF DISCOVERY AND MY
trainval/yDubrSRjlCE/50006 SHOULD I SAY SOMETHING
trainval/yDubrSRjlCE/50007 THIS WAS 2007 SO FINANCIALLY THINGS FOR A LOT OF FOLKS WEREN'T GOING VERY GOOD
trainval/yDubrSRjlCE/50008 I LOOKED BACK AND HE WAS POINTING DOWN AT THE SIGN IN MY BASKET
trainval/yDubrSRjlCE/50009 IT WAS VERY QUICK
trainval/yDubrSRjlCE/50010 IT WAS VERY SIMPLE
trainval/yDubrSRjlCE/50011 I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A BIKE TO RIDE I DO NOT HAVE ONE TO RIDE
trainval/yDubrSRjlCE/50012 ALL OF MY FRIENDS HAVE BIKES AND I CANNOT GO AND FEEL SAD
trainval/yDubrSRjlCE/50013 I WOULD BE SO HAPPY TO HAVE A BIKE I DO NOT CARE ABOUT COLOR
trainval/yDubrSRjlCE/50014 AT THIS POINT YOU'LL HAVE BROKEN BACK INTO THE SPEED OF DISCOVERY
trainval/yDubrSRjlCE/50015 JUST ONE TIME NEXT WEEK LOOK AT THE WEATHER FORECAST CHOOSE THE NICEST DAY OF THE WEEK AND GO FOR A RIDE
trainval/YDvbDiJZpy0/50001 HE SAID WELL WHY DIDN'T YOU USE A RATIO
trainval/YDvbDiJZpy0/50002 A RATIO THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AS EXACT
trainval/yDYCf4ONh5M/50001 THAT'S A BIG DISK
trainval/yDYCf4ONh5M/50004 AND WE'RE SEEING THAT ALREADY WITH SAY PHONES
trainval/yDYCf4ONh5M/50005 THEY'RE GOING TO TALK TO THE MACHINE
trainval/yDYCf4ONh5M/50006 WHY SHOULD YOU BE DOING THAT
trainval/ydZfSuzSHu8/50001 EAT MOSTLY PLANTS
trainval/ydZfSuzSHu8/50002 I'M LIKE YES I GOT THAT
trainval/ydZfSuzSHu8/50003 I WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THEM
trainval/ydZfSuzSHu8/50004 WHAT IS FOOD JUSTICE 2
trainval/ydzNAuqUAnc/50001 IS THE ANSWER TO JUST GIVE UP ON THE IDEA OF DEMOCRACY
trainval/ydzNAuqUAnc/50002 WELL OBVIOUSLY NOT
trainval/ydzNAuqUAnc/50003 IN AFGHANISTAN IT COULD HAVE MEANT INSTEAD OF CONCENTRATING ON THE BIG PRESIDENTIAL AND PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS WE SHOULD
trainval/ydzNAuqUAnc/50004 WHY SHOULD WE GET AWAY FROM THESE ARGUMENTS
trainval/ydzNAuqUAnc/50005 BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY DANGEROUS
trainval/ye8sVvVJdg4/50001 IT'S A PHOTO THAT'S HAPPENING NOW IT'S GOING VIRAL NOW
trainval/YeXcNpVkezI/50001 NOT ONLY IS THAT NUMBER COMPLETELY UNSUSTAINABLE BUT THE PREVIOUS YEAR 41 PER CENT
trainval/YeXcNpVkezI/50002 IT'S ACTUALLY GONE UP SINCE THE RELEASE OF THE DOCUMENT
trainval/YeXcNpVkezI/50003 THAT'S NOT WHAT WE MEAN WHEN WE SAY WE WANT JOB CREATION
trainval/YeXcNpVkezI/50004 CALIFORNIA'S ALMOND CROP ALONE SPENT 294 MILLION IN POLLINATION SERVICES
trainval/YeXcNpVkezI/50005 AND ACCORDING TO A USDA REPORT IF WE USE NATIVE BEES TO SUPPLEMENT FOR SOME POLLINATION EFFORTS WE CAN
trainval/YeXcNpVkezI/50006 PARKING LOTS ARE AN EYESORE AND A POOR USE OF LAND IN MY OPINION BUT JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE
trainval/yFVXsjVdvmY/50001 BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT MATHEMATICS HASN'T GOT SOMETHING THAT IT CAN OFFER US BECAUSE
trainval/yFVXsjVdvmY/50002 BUT SOME OTHER PEOPLE I
trainval/yFVXsjVdvmY/50003 BUT THE WAY THAT PEOPLE WOULD VOTE WOULD BE VERY DIFFERENT
trainval/yFVXsjVdvmY/50004 BUT ACTUALLY THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IF YOU WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL
trainval/yFVXsjVdvmY/50006 FOR ONE THING IT'S VERY HARD TO KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD BE MEASURING OR WHAT YOU SHOULD BE QUANTIFYING
trainval/yFVXsjVdvmY/50007 GOTTMAN OBSERVED HUNDREDS OF COUPLES HAVING A CONVERSATION AND RECORDED WELL
trainval/yFVXsjVdvmY/50008 NOW I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT GOOD MARRIAGES WERE ABOUT COMPROMISE AND UNDERSTANDING AND ALLOWING THE PERSON TO
trainval/yFVXsjVdvmY/50009 SO I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL RELATIONSHIPS WERE ONES WHERE THERE WAS A REALLY HIGH NEGATIVITY
trainval/yFVXsjVdvmY/50010 WHERE COUPLES LET THINGS GO AND ONLY BROUGHT THINGS UP IF THEY REALLY WERE A BIG DEAL
trainval/yFVXsjVdvmY/50011 THE BEST COUPLES OR THE MOST SUCCESSFUL COUPLES ARE THE ONES WITH A REALLY LOW NEGATIVITY THRESHOLD
trainval/yFVXsjVdvmY/50012 NOW OF COURSE IT TAKES A BIT MORE THAN JUST A LOW NEGATIVITY THRESHOLD AND NOT
trainval/yFVXsjVdvmY/50013 SO THOSE ARE MY TOP THREE TIPS OF HOW MATHS CAN HELP YOU WITH LOVE AND RELATIONSHIPS
trainval/yFVXsjVdvmY/50014 BECAUSE FOR ME EQUATIONS AND SYMBOLS AREN'T JUST A THING
trainval/yFVXsjVdvmY/50015 SO I HOPE THAT PERHAPS FOR JUST A COUPLE OF YOU A LITTLE BIT OF INSIGHT INTO THE MATHEMATICS OF LOVE CAN PERSUADE YOU TO HAVE A
trainval/yG7v4ySxwzQ/50001 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THINGS GO WRONG
trainval/yG7v4ySxwzQ/50002 HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE
trainval/yG7v4ySxwzQ/50003 IT WAS INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE TO WATCH
trainval/yG7v4ySxwzQ/50004 AND IF YOU WATCHED THE BRAZILIAN PLAYERS THEIR HEADS DROPPED
trainval/yG7v4ySxwzQ/50007 HE WAS EXTREMELY CONFIDENT
trainval/yG7v4ySxwzQ/50008 PERHAPS HE WAS NOT VERY CONFIDENT INSIDE WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUPREMELY CONFIDENT OF HIS
trainval/yG7v4ySxwzQ/50009 SUCH AS THOSE BY JAMES MAGNUSSEN OR ROY MCAVOY
trainval/yG7v4ySxwzQ/50010 THERE'S A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES THAT ATHLETES CAN USE TO BOOST THEIR CONFIDENCE
trainval/yG7v4ySxwzQ/50011 AND THAT'S BECAUSE HAVING GOALS THAT ARE REALISTIC RELEVANT SPECIFIC MEASURABLE AND SO FORTH
trainval/yG7v4ySxwzQ/50012 SO RELAXATION TECHNIQUES ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN THIS REGARD AND PSYCHOLOGISTS WILL WORK WITH ATHLETES TO TRY
trainval/yg8SBuTuoKk/50001 PEACE CANNOT BE SHARED OR CREATED WITH OTHERS IF WE CANNOT FIRST GENERATE IT
trainval/yg8SBuTuoKk/50002 ASK IS THIS FAIR
trainval/yg8SBuTuoKk/50003 I DON'T NEED A PLASTIC BAG
trainval/yg8SBuTuoKk/50004 START BY HAVING THE FIRST CONVERSATION AT YOUR OWN KITCHEN TABLE
trainval/yg8SBuTuoKk/50005 ONE TO FEEL SO OVERWHELMED OR UNQUALIFIED WE DO NOTHING
trainval/yg8SBuTuoKk/50006 I ASK THE WORLD TO END SUFFERING BUT DO I SHOW UP FOR THOSE WHO ARE SUFFERING ON MY STREET CORNER
trainval/yg8SBuTuoKk/50007 SHE DID NOT SAY I'M NOT A CONGRESSMAN OR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SO HOW COULD I POSSIBLY
trainval/yg8SBuTuoKk/50008 WHAT SHOULD I DO
trainval/yg8SBuTuoKk/50009 NEAR AND FAR PEOPLE GAVE THEIR DOLLARS THEY GAVE THEIR CENTS THEY GAVE THEIR HEARTS
trainval/ygKNRnz7q5o/50001 FOR PARENTS AND EDUCATORS ADHD POSES COMPLEX QUESTIONS OF HOW BEST TO SERVE
trainval/ygKNRnz7q5o/50002 I'M DELIGHTED TO PRESENT SUCH A KNOWLEDGEABLE INCREDIBLE EDUCATOR TO ENLIGHTEN US ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT
trainval/ygKNRnz7q5o/50003 PLEASE WELCOME DR
trainval/ygKNRnz7q5o/50004 NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG
trainval/ygKNRnz7q5o/50005 AND I WORRY THAT WE DON'T GIVE ENOUGH ATTENTION TO THAT
trainval/ygKNRnz7q5o/50006 I'M MADELEINE MACEDA HEIDE I'M THE ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT FOR THE AMERICAN SCHOOL OF BOMBAY
trainval/ygKNRnz7q5o/50007 AND THEN YOU TURN TOWARD THAT NOISE TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THE CAUSE OF IS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM
trainval/ygKNRnz7q5o/50008 BUT THERE ARE ALSO OTHER THINGS THAT CAN CAUSE A DISTRACTION THAT CAN CAUSE US TO LOOK LIKE WE'RE NOT PAYING
trainval/ygKNRnz7q5o/50009 NOW THIS INFORMATION COMES FROM THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL IN THE UNITED STATES
trainval/ygKNRnz7q5o/50010 5 MILLION CHILDREN
trainval/ygKNRnz7q5o/50011 WELL WHY IS THIS
trainval/ygKNRnz7q5o/50012 SO WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN YOU GET TOO MUCH CAFFEINE IN YOUR BODY IF YOU'VE EVER HAD TOO MUCH
trainval/ygKNRnz7q5o/50013 AND I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THERE ARE A LOT OF THOSE PRODUCTS RIGHT HERE AS WELL
trainval/ygKNRnz7q5o/50014 WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE EFFECT IT HAS ON THE GROWING BRAIN
trainval/ygKNRnz7q5o/50015 REMEMBER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DEVELOPING BRAINS HERE
trainval/ygKNRnz7q5o/50016 CHILDREN CAN BE UNDER ALL KINDS OF STRESS
trainval/ygKNRnz7q5o/50017 I KNOW MY PARENTS DID
trainval/ygKNRnz7q5o/50018 WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY IS THEY DON'T HAVE THAT CONVERSATION VERY OFTEN
trainval/ygKNRnz7q5o/50019 SO THEY'RE SPENDING THAT MUCH MORE TIME CONNECTED TO THEIR OUTSIDE WORLD THAN TO THEIR INSIDE WORLD WHERE THEY SHOULD
trainval/ygKNRnz7q5o/50020 SO THAT'S ANOTHER ONE TO WATCH FOR
trainval/ygKNRnz7q5o/50021 SO MY WHOLE PURPOSE HERE TODAY IS TO SAY
trainval/YglyHzvBqpA/50001 HOW DID THEY ACTUALLY MANAGE IT
trainval/YglyHzvBqpA/50002 BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE DEVELOPED A WHOLE NEW SYSTEM OF GETTING DRESSED WHICH REVOLVES AROUND
trainval/YglyHzvBqpA/50003 ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
trainval/YglyHzvBqpA/50004 WHAT REALLY HAPPENS IS THAT WE'RE NOW LOOKING AT RATHER THAN TWO OR FOUR SEASONS A YEAR WE'RE
trainval/YglyHzvBqpA/50005 AND THESE ARE BIG BIG NAMES GOING OUT THERE INTO THIS MULTI BILLION POUND SECTOR AND REPRESENTING BRITISH
trainval/YglyHzvBqpA/50006 SO THEY'RE NOT JUST DOING THE AUTUMN WINTER THE SPRING SUMMER THEY'RE ALSO HAVING TO WORK ON PRE FALL
trainval/YglyHzvBqpA/50007 SO THE HIGH STREET BRANDS HAVE REALLY DEMOCRATIZED STYLE YOU'RE ABLE TO GET HOLD OF IT
trainval/ygmlKMQ8kc4/50001 THE 20TH CENTURY WAS THIS TIME OF HUGE OPTIMISM ABOUT WHAT SCIENCE COULD OFFER BUT WITH ALL OF THE FOCUS ON LIFE
trainval/ygmlKMQ8kc4/50002 WE NOW TEND TO DIE OF CANCER AND HEART DISEASE AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT MANY OF US WILL HAVE A LONG PERIOD OF
trainval/ygmlKMQ8kc4/50003 DURING THAT PERIOD WE'LL LIKELY SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN HOSPITALS AND HOSPICES AND CARE HOMES
trainval/ygmlKMQ8kc4/50004 A HUNDRED YEARS AGO WE TENDED TO DIE OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES LIKE PNEUMONIA THAT IF THEY TOOK HOLD WOULD TAKE US AWAY
trainval/ygmlKMQ8kc4/50005 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SURPRISED ME MOST IN MY RESEARCH THOUGH IS HOW CHANGEABLE ATTITUDES ACTUALLY ARE
trainval/YGoI3B86iX4/50001 AND THE FIRST QUESTION WAS
trainval/YGoI3B86iX4/50002 IF SHE LEFT YOU TOMORROW WOULD YOU BE OKAY
trainval/YGoI3B86iX4/50004 IS THAT CRAZY
trainval/YGoI3B86iX4/50005 WE ARE ATTRACTED TO AND TEND TO CHOOSE PEOPLE WHO WOUND US IN A SIMILAR WAY AS A PARENT WHO WOUNDED
trainval/YGoI3B86iX4/50006 ONE TO FIVE PERCENT OF WHAT WE DO IS CONSCIOUS
trainval/YGoI3B86iX4/50007 AND YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR PAST NONE OF US CAN CHANGE OUR PAST
trainval/ygRNoieAnzI/50001 I DIDN'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE NOTES
trainval/ygRNoieAnzI/50002 AND AFTER SOME TIME THIS PERCEPTION BECAME A FEELING
trainval/ygRNoieAnzI/50003 AND ALSO SOME RACHMANINOV PIANO CONCERTOS AS MAIN DISHES AND SOME BJORK OR MADONNA
trainval/ygRNoieAnzI/50004 THEY HAVE SIMILAR SOUND OF EYES
trainval/ygRNoieAnzI/50005 SO YOU RELATE PEOPLE THAT YOU WOULDN'T RELATE AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY ALSO CREATE
trainval/ygRNoieAnzI/50006 SO I CONNECT THE EYE AND THEN I PLAY THE AUDIENCE'S FACES
trainval/ygRNoieAnzI/50007 I THINK THIS WILL BE A BIG BIG CHANGE THAT WE WILL SEE DURING THIS CENTURY
trainval/YhCkjRXgnDw/50001 I'LL JUST DRIVE NO STOP
trainval/YhCkjRXgnDw/50002 MAYBE I CAN FIND SOMETHING THERE
trainval/YhCkjRXgnDw/50003 IT WAS SO EASY TO DO
trainval/YhG1Bgbsj2w/50001 WHERE WE HAVE NOW COME TO LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE THE MOST EXTREME FORMS OF VIOLENCE THE
trainval/YhG1Bgbsj2w/50002 AND I WANT TO SAY WE'VE ANNIHILATED IT IN MEN AS WELL AS IN WOMEN
trainval/YhG1Bgbsj2w/50003 I ACTUALLY REALIZED ONCE IN KOSOVO WHEN I WATCHED A MAN BREAK DOWN THAT BULLETS ARE ACTUALLY
trainval/YhG1Bgbsj2w/50004 I'VE SEEN GIRLS WHO WERE BEATEN BY THEIR MOTHERS AND BROTHERS AND FATHERS AND
trainval/YhG1Bgbsj2w/50005 AND I HAVE TO NOW SHARE A FEW STORIES OF GIRLS I'VE SEEN ACROSS THE PLANET WHO
trainval/YhG1Bgbsj2w/50006 AND SHE LOOKED INTO HER BABY'S EYES AND SHE SAID OF COURSE I LOVE MY BABY
trainval/YhG1Bgbsj2w/50007 HOW COULD I NOT LOVE MY BABY
trainval/YhG1Bgbsj2w/50008 IT'S MY BABY AND IT'S FULL OF LOVE
trainval/YhG1Bgbsj2w/50009 SO FOR YEARS AGNES WALKED THROUGH THE RIFT VALLEY
trainval/YhG1Bgbsj2w/50010 WE SELL THEM WE KILL THEM AS EMBRYOS WE ENSLAVE THEM WE RAPE THEM
trainval/YhG1Bgbsj2w/50011 JACLYN WAS 14 YEARS OLD AND SHE WAS IN HER MASAI FAMILY AND THERE'S A DROUGHT IN KENYA
trainval/YhG1Bgbsj2w/50013 WE ARE SO ACCUSTOMED TO ROBBING GIRLS OF THE SUBJECT OF BEING THE SUBJECTS OF THEIR LIVES THAT WE
trainval/YhG1Bgbsj2w/50014 AND WHEN SHE GOT TO THE HOUSE SHE WAS GREETED
trainval/YhG1Bgbsj2w/50015 HE SAID YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL
trainval/YhG1Bgbsj2w/50016 YOU HAVE GROWN INTO A GORGEOUS WOMAN
trainval/YhG1Bgbsj2w/50017 AND I WILL BE IN YOUR CORNER FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
trainval/YhG1Bgbsj2w/50019 I AM AN EMOTIONAL CREATURE
trainval/YhG1Bgbsj2w/50020 I LOVE THAT I DO NOT TAKE THINGS LIGHTLY
trainval/YhG1Bgbsj2w/50021 THEY MAKE ME PRESENT
trainval/YhG1Bgbsj2w/50023 WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO SHUT ME DOWN OR TURN ME OFF
trainval/YhG1Bgbsj2w/50024 I CAN'T STAND IT
trainval/YhG1Bgbsj2w/50025 IT'S ALL BAD
trainval/YhG1Bgbsj2w/50026 MY BROTHERS GET EVERYTHING
trainval/YhJPoyv8O3A/50001 AND NOT EVERYBODY HAS THAT PERMISSION OR THAT PRIVILEGE UNFORTUNATELY
trainval/YhJPoyv8O3A/50005 YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD
trainval/YhJPoyv8O3A/50006 THAT IN GENERAL YOU ARE EXACTLY THE SAME AS EACH OTHER
trainval/YhJPoyv8O3A/50007 EVERY 21 YEAR OLD THAT I MEET NOWADAYS HAS GOT A 1000 FRIENDS AND SOME OF YOU OLD
trainval/yhMi0tkYyT8/50001 LIKE NOW YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT LIKE YOU GOTTA GET ON WITH THAT
trainval/yhMi0tkYyT8/50002 AND THEN I THINK NO THIS IS THE NEW YORK CITY SUBWAY
trainval/YhpMSjbVopo/50001 THE BECOMING IS THE CREATIVE PART OF THE BRAIN
trainval/YhpMSjbVopo/50002 ONE CHILD MIGHT RESPOND TO MY BROKEN ARM
trainval/YhpMSjbVopo/50003 A DIFFERENT CHILD MIGHT RESPOND TO THE SAME SITUATION
trainval/YhpMSjbVopo/50004 BAD CHILD I TOLD YOU NOT TO JUMP FROM THAT TABLE
trainval/YhpMSjbVopo/50005 WHAT IS THE EXPERIENCE THAT THE CHILD BRINGS TO SCHOOL
trainval/YhpMSjbVopo/50006 SO IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THESE HIGH STAKES TESTS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO A
trainval/YhpMSjbVopo/50007 WE HAVE A CASCADE OF PRINCIPALS FEARFUL OF THEIR JOBS OTHER ADMINISTRATORS FEARFUL
trainval/yioZhHe1i5M/50001 HOW WOULD YOU DO IT
trainval/yioZhHe1i5M/50002 ASTROLABES HAVE AN INCREDIBLE HISTORY
trainval/yioZhHe1i5M/50003 BUT A REAL ONE WOULD COST ABOUT AS MUCH AS MY HOUSE AND THE HOUSE NEXT TO IT AND ACTUALLY EVERY HOUSE ON THE BLOCK
trainval/yioZhHe1i5M/50004 THEY ARE JUST INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE
trainval/yioZhHe1i5M/50005 BUT I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU HOW WOULD YOU TELL THE TIME IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE AN IPHONE
trainval/yioZhHe1i5M/50006 HE WOULD NOT ONLY KNOW WHAT TIME IT WAS HE WOULD ALSO KNOW WHERE THE SUN WOULD RISE AND HOW IT
trainval/yioZhHe1i5M/50007 HOW WOULD YOU TELL THE TIME SAY 600 YEARS AGO
trainval/yioZhHe1i5M/50008 IT'S JUST AN INCREDIBLE DEVICE
trainval/yioZhHe1i5M/50009 EVERY TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES
trainval/yioZhHe1i5M/50010 EVERY TECHNOLOGY IS TRANSFORMED AND MOVED BY OTHERS
trainval/yioZhHe1i5M/50011 AND WHAT WE GAIN WITH A NEW TECHNOLOGY OF COURSE IS PRECISION AND ACCURACY
trainval/yioZhHe1i5M/50012 BUT WHAT WE LOSE I THINK IS AN ACCURATE A FELT SENSE OF THE SKY A SENSE OF
trainval/yioZhHe1i5M/50013 AND ASTROLABES RETURN US TO THIS SUBTLE SENSE OF HOW THINGS ALL FIT TOGETHER AND ALSO HOW
trainval/YiXdS9DFCOQ/50001 THERE'S SOMETHING WEIRD HAPPENING
trainval/YiXdS9DFCOQ/50002 AND AS I SAY I'M NOT A NEUROSCIENTIST BUT TO UNDERSTAND HOW I CAN START TO ASSEMBLE THINGS THAT WILL VERY
trainval/YiXdS9DFCOQ/50003 IT'S SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER
trainval/yJJtRWFLSgw/50001 I COULD DO A LOT MORE
trainval/yJJtRWFLSgw/50002 WELL WE'VE ALL HAD THAT CONVERSATION BEFORE
trainval/yJJtRWFLSgw/50003 WE ALSO KNOW THAT MEAT PRODUCTION REQUIRES A LOT OF WATER
trainval/yJJtRWFLSgw/50004 WE ALSO KNOW PERHAPS MOST MORALLY SALIENT THAT DUE TO FACTORY FARMING ANIMALS
trainval/yJJtRWFLSgw/50005 BUT WHAT IS A PERSON WHO EATS LESS MEAT
trainval/yJJtRWFLSgw/50006 YOU COULD SAY
trainval/yJJtRWFLSgw/50007 SO WHATEVER IT IS ABOUT WORDS LIKE FLEXITARIAN AND VEGAN WE KNOW THEY CONJURE ENTIRELY
trainval/yJJtRWFLSgw/50008 I BET MANY OF YOU HERE TODAY ARE ALREADY REDUCITARIANS
trainval/yJJtRWFLSgw/50009 AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE THIS PERCENTAGE IS EVEN LOWER FOR VEGANS
trainval/yJJtRWFLSgw/50010 ONCE IN A WHILE WE WOULD GO OUT TO EAT I'D ORDER BACON WITH MY EGGS AND PANCAKES AND THEY
trainval/yJJtRWFLSgw/50011 THAT IS A DOUBLE WHAMMY NO ONE WANTS TO EXPERIENCE WITH THEIR MORNING COFFEE
trainval/yJJtRWFLSgw/50012 SOMETIMES I EAT MEAT AND SOMETIMES I DON'T
trainval/YJM6WUNDnhA/50001 AND SHE SAID WELL SHE LIVES IN LOUISIANA
trainval/YJM6WUNDnhA/50002 I'M LIKE I'M FROM GEORGIA I GET THAT
trainval/YJM6WUNDnhA/50003 AND THE EVENING AFTER HER FUNERAL I WAS SITTING AND READING HER OBITUARY OVER AND OVER
trainval/YJM6WUNDnhA/50004 THEY TOOK ME TO BUY MY PROM DRESS
trainval/YKACzIrog24/50001 OF COURSE HE STUDIED A LOT
trainval/YKACzIrog24/50002 HE STUDIED LAW AND PHILOSOPHY WITH GUIDANCE FROM MENTORS BUT HE ALSO REALIZED THAT BEING A LAWYER
trainval/YKACzIrog24/50003 IT IS THIS TYPE OF PRACTICE IN THE LEARNING ZONE WHICH LEADS TO SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT NOT JUST TIME ON
trainval/YKACzIrog24/50004 THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE TRUE IN TEACHING GENERAL MEDICINE NURSING AND OTHER FIELDS AND IT HAPPENS BECAUSE
trainval/YKACzIrog24/50005 THEY READ TO EXTEND THEIR KNOWLEDGE CONSULT WITH COLLEAGUES OR DOMAIN EXPERTS TRY OUT NEW STRATEGIES SOLICIT
trainval/YKACzIrog24/50006 IN WHAT OTHER PARTS OF OUR LIVES PERHAPS THAT WE CARE MORE ABOUT ARE WE WORKING HARD BUT NOT IMPROVING
trainval/YKACzIrog24/50007 IT CAN ALSO BE MOTIVATING AND IT PROVIDES US WITH INFORMATION TO IDENTIFY WHAT TO FOCUS ON NEXT WHEN WE GO BACK TO THE
trainval/YKACzIrog24/50008 A TIGHTROPE WALKER DOESN'T PRACTICE NEW TRICKS WITHOUT A NET UNDERNEATH AND AN ATHLETE WOULDN'T SET OUT TO FIRST TRY A NEW MOVE
trainval/YKACzIrog24/50009 FOR EXAMPLE WE MIGHT FIND A MENTOR OR A TRUSTED COLLEAGUE WITH WHOM WE CAN EXCHANGE IDEAS OR HAVE VULNERABLE
trainval/YkzwHuf6C2U/50001 WE'RE TALKING 1
trainval/YkzwHuf6C2U/50002 THE NUMBER DIDN'T SURPRISE ME
trainval/YkzwHuf6C2U/50003 OUR BRAINS ARE KIND OF WEIRD
trainval/YkzwHuf6C2U/50004 WHY AREN'T WE CHANGING THE BEHAVIOR IN THE ACTUAL CYBERBULLY
trainval/YkzwHuf6C2U/50005 WOULD THEY STILL BE AS WILLING TO DO IT
trainval/YkzwHuf6C2U/50006 THINK ABOUT THAT
trainval/YkzwHuf6C2U/50007 I'M A GLOBAL FINALIST
trainval/YL1XwfyaS00/50001 AND WITH THAT CALL MY LIFE WOULD CHANGE FOREVER
trainval/YL1XwfyaS00/50002 WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKE WHEN YOU FIRST WALKED INTO THAT BUILDING AND SAW SO MANY OILED
trainval/YL1XwfyaS00/50003 AND I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP BUT I ALWAYS WONDERED
trainval/YL1XwfyaS00/50004 WHAT COULD ONE PERSON POSSIBLY DO TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
trainval/YL1XwfyaS00/50005 BUT THEN FINALLY ONE OF THE RESEARCHERS THREW OUT THIS CRAZY IDEA
trainval/YL1XwfyaS00/50006 SO IT HAD BEEN A HUGE GAMBLE BUT IT HAD PAID OFF
trainval/YL1XwfyaS00/50007 AND AS A RESULT DURING THE TREASURE RESCUE JUST 160 PENGUINS DIED
trainval/YL1XwfyaS00/50008 IN ADDITION I BELIEVE THAT EVERY OILED ANIMAL DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE
trainval/YL1XwfyaS00/50009 SO HE RACED TO THE LAB AND MADE ENOUGH TO CLEAN THE REST OF THE BIRDS
trainval/YL1XwfyaS00/50010 WELL SHE COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG
trainval/YL1XwfyaS00/50011 THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE ONE YEAR AGO THE AFRICAN PENGUIN WAS
trainval/YL1XwfyaS00/50012 JUST LOOK AT THAT 17 YEAR OLD
trainval/YL1XwfyaS00/50013 AND WHEN WE COME TOGETHER AND WORK AS ONE WE CAN ACHIEVE EXTRAORDINARY
trainval/YL1XwfyaS00/50014 AND TRULY TO BE A PART OF SOMETHING SO MUCH LARGER THAN YOURSELF IS THE MOST REWARDING
trainval/YL1XwfyaS00/50015 WELL YOU SHOULD CARE BECAUSE THEY'RE AN INDICATOR SPECIES
trainval/YL1XwfyaS00/50016 AND SIMPLY PUT
trainval/YL1XwfyaS00/50017 IF PENGUINS ARE DYING IT MEANS OUR OCEANS ARE DYING
trainval/YL1XwfyaS00/50018 AND THE TWO MAIN THREATS TO PENGUINS TODAY ARE OVERFISHING AND GLOBAL WARMING
trainval/YL1XwfyaS00/50019 SO IF WE EACH DO OUR PART TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND WE CAN HELP KEEP PENGUINS
trainval/YL1XwfyaS00/50020 BUT PARTWAY THROUGH THEY RAN OUT
trainval/yldVmMfMyIg/50001 140 MILLION AMERICANS VOTED FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND YET AS ALL OF US
trainval/yldVmMfMyIg/50002 WHAT IS YOUR VISION FOR YOUR COUNTRY'S FUTURE IN THE WORLD
trainval/yldVmMfMyIg/50003 DON'T GET ME WRONG
trainval/yldVmMfMyIg/50004 I RECKON IF YOU'RE STANDING TO BECOME THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES YOU'RE PROBABLY PRETTY TIED UP MOST OF THE
trainval/yldVmMfMyIg/50005 AND SOME OF THEM DO MUCH MORE THAN ANSWER
trainval/yldVmMfMyIg/50006 I'VE GOT SOME WONDERFUL PEOPLE HERE WHO WON THE GLOBAL VOTE
trainval/yldVmMfMyIg/50007 WE ALWAYS GET IT WRONG BY THE WAY
trainval/yldVmMfMyIg/50008 WE'VE GOT THE EX PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND WHO WOULD BE A WONDERFUL MEMBER OF THE TEAM
trainval/yldVmMfMyIg/50009 AND SO VERY OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO COOPERATE AND WE HAVE TO COLLABORATE AS NATIONS IF WE'RE GOING TO
trainval/yldVmMfMyIg/50010 IT'S SO OBVIOUS AND YET WE DON'T
trainval/yldVmMfMyIg/50011 I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM ACTUALLY WITH DONALD TRUMP'S CREDO OF AMERICA FIRST
trainval/yldVmMfMyIg/50012 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT'S A PRETTY BANAL STATEMENT OF WHAT POLITICIANS HAVE ALWAYS DONE AND PROBABLY SHOULD ALWAYS DO
trainval/yldVmMfMyIg/50013 WHEN PEOPLE TURN INWARDS AND TURN BACKWARDS HUMAN PROGRESS BECOMES REVERSED AND THINGS GET WORSE FOR EVERYBODY
trainval/YLGX78yqcsQ/50001 BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/YLGX78yqcsQ/50002 I'M GOING TO GUIDE THE COMPUTER WHILE IT PLAYS IN CERTAIN RHYTHMS BUT IT'S GOING TO CREATE THE NOTES AND THE HARMONIES ITSELF
trainval/yLjxoscCi0A/50001 BECAUSE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE FOR BUILDING SPACE SYSTEMS IS ENTIRELY EARTH BOUND
trainval/yLjxoscCi0A/50002 I THINK WE NEED TO CREATE BACKUPS OF HUMANKIND ELSEWHERE IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM
trainval/YlmZkY1uqXM/50001 NO OFFENSE TO THEM
trainval/YlmZkY1uqXM/50002 MY NAME IS NEREIDA
trainval/YlmZkY1uqXM/50003 IT'S LIKE THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE
trainval/YlmZkY1uqXM/50004 IT'S JUST I COULDN'T LIKE I COULDN'T PROCESS
trainval/YlmZkY1uqXM/50005 IT WAS REALLY TOO MUCH
trainval/YlmZkY1uqXM/50006 I DON'T KNOW WHY
trainval/YlmZkY1uqXM/50008 AS LIKE THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT PEOPLE
trainval/YlmZkY1uqXM/50009 SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S THE MOST POPULAR DIET
trainval/YlmZkY1uqXM/50010 I MEAN REALLY FAST
trainval/YlmZkY1uqXM/50011 NO I AM TEASING ABOUT THAT
trainval/YlmZkY1uqXM/50012 THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH A WOMAN OF SIZE
trainval/YlmZkY1uqXM/50013 THAT IS WHAT I AM TRYING TO SAY
trainval/Ym6VkhUn0ec/50001 BUT EITHER WAY I HAVE LEARNT TO MAKE IT HAPPEN
trainval/Ym6VkhUn0ec/50002 AND I JUST TRY AND THINK ABOUT IT IN SIMPLER TERMS
trainval/Ym6VkhUn0ec/50003 OF COURSE NOT
trainval/Ym6VkhUn0ec/50004 I AM GOING TO FIGURE A WAY TO GET WHAT I WANT
trainval/Ym6VkhUn0ec/50005 AND IT WAS THE SAME WAY ON THE COURSE
trainval/Ym6VkhUn0ec/50006 AND WHEN I WAS THE FIRST WOMAN TO COMPLETE THE AMERICAN NINJA WARRIOR COURSE I WAS ON TOP OF THE WORLD
trainval/Ym6VkhUn0ec/50007 WITH YOUR HANDS ON ONE SIDE FEET ON ONE SIDE
trainval/Ym6VkhUn0ec/50008 I DID IT I WEDGED MY FEET IN THERE
trainval/YmlAl1SMtHk/50001 SEXUAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND RIGHTS REMAIN SEEN AS A WOMEN'S ISSUE AND PRIMARILY THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND
trainval/YmlAl1SMtHk/50002 MEN NEED SEX MORE THAN WOMEN DO AND THAT'S WHAT WOMEN EXPECT
trainval/YmlAl1SMtHk/50003 THIS MAN REFLECTING THE BEHAVIOR AND VIEWS OF SO MANY OTHERS PUT HIS OWN SEXUAL PLEASURE
trainval/YmlAl1SMtHk/50004 THEREFORE WHAT I WANT TO SAY TO YOU TODAY IS IT'S TIME TO TALK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND RIGHTS
trainval/YmlAl1SMtHk/50005 OF THEIR OWN BODIES OR THE BODIES OF THEIR PARTNERS
trainval/YmlAl1SMtHk/50006 WE ARE MEN AND WOMEN OF ALL RACES AND SEXUALITIES WORKING TOGETHER
trainval/YmRKlZEXVQM/50001 WHY DO PEOPLE STAY
trainval/YmRKlZEXVQM/50002 I NEEDED THE MONEY
trainval/YmRKlZEXVQM/50003 I WAS A SINGLE MOM
trainval/YmRKlZEXVQM/50004 DOCUMENT DOCUMENT DOCUMENT
trainval/YmRKlZEXVQM/50005 THIS IS WHAT I TRIED TO DO
trainval/YmRKlZEXVQM/50006 I'M TALKING ABOUT AT HOME TOO
trainval/YmRKlZEXVQM/50007 AND THE MOST IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP IS WITH OURSELVES LEARNING TO VALUE OURSELVES
trainval/YmRKlZEXVQM/50008 THIS IS WHAT DIDN'T WORK
trainval/YMyofREc5Jk/50001 WHY ARE THEY RUNNING FOR THAT CASH REGISTER
trainval/YMyofREc5Jk/50002 WHY IS IT A FREE FOR ALL AND FIRST COME FIRST SERVED
trainval/YMyofREc5Jk/50003 THE NORWEGIAN FOREST IS A GOOD THING ISN'T IT NORWEGIANS IN THE ROOM
trainval/YMyofREc5Jk/50004 IT'S ALL GOOD IT'S FRESH AIR NATURE ELKS SKIING IT'S FANTASTIC
trainval/YMyofREc5Jk/50005 HOW COULD YOU KNOW THAT
trainval/YMyofREc5Jk/50007 IF THEY OPEN ANOTHER CASH REGISTER THE SAME WILL HAPPEN
trainval/YMyofREc5Jk/50008 NOW I'M JUST GOING TO CHECK
trainval/YMyofREc5Jk/50009 YOU KNOW WHY
trainval/YMyofREc5Jk/50010 THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT OF SMALL TALK
trainval/YMyofREc5Jk/50011 RULE NUMBER 1
trainval/YMyofREc5Jk/50013 LISTEN TO THE ANSWER PICK OUT A WORD FOLLOW UP THAT WORD
trainval/YMyofREc5Jk/50014 YVES COMPLAINED A LOT AS WELL
trainval/Yn9fTcSWMbo/50001 STATUS IS REALLY GOOD MOTIVATOR
trainval/Yn9fTcSWMbo/50002 THEY'RE NOT VERY WELL DESIGNED
trainval/Yn9fTcSWMbo/50003 HOPEFULLY FOR GOOD
trainval/Yn9fTcSWMbo/50005 AND IF YOU'RE HAPPY WITH THAT FANTASTIC
trainval/Yn9fTcSWMbo/50006 IF YOU'RE NOT TOO BAD
trainval/Yn9fTcSWMbo/50007 THAT'S REALLY REALLY POWERFUL
trainval/Yn9fTcSWMbo/50008 THEY SHOULD RECOGNIZE THEY'VE BUILT AN APPOINTMENT DYNAMIC AND LEVERAGE THE GAMES
trainval/Yn9fTcSWMbo/50009 THEN YOU CAN REALLY ACHIEVE GOOD IN SOME INTERESTING WAYS
trainval/Yn9fTcSWMbo/50010 AND THAT'S VERY POWERFUL TO ME
trainval/Yn9fTcSWMbo/50011 AND THAT'S A VERY POWERFUL THING
trainval/Yn9fTcSWMbo/50012 PROGRESSION IS POWERFUL
trainval/Yn9fTcSWMbo/50013 WE USE GAME DYNAMICS TO BUILD ON IT
trainval/Yn9fTcSWMbo/50014 WE BUILD WITH MINDSHARE
trainval/Yn9fTcSWMbo/50015 WHY HAVE GAMES YOU CAN LOSE
trainval/Yn9fTcSWMbo/50016 WHY GO FROM AN A TO AN F OR A B TO A C
trainval/Yn9fTcSWMbo/50017 WHY NOT LEVEL UP
trainval/YnAVjkuQzSY/50001 SO AT MINUS 271 DEGREES COLDER THAN THE SPACE BETWEEN THE STARS THOSE WIRES CAN TAKE THAT CURRENT
trainval/ynSrWmoq7Is/50001 MY MOTHER IS SCHIZOPHRENIC
trainval/ynSrWmoq7Is/50002 SO IN THAT MOMENT I STOOD THERE AND ALTHOUGH I WAS AFRAID I REALIZED THAT
trainval/ynSrWmoq7Is/50003 OFTENTIMES WE CHOOSE ONE EMOTION
trainval/ynSrWmoq7Is/50004 BUT AT THAT MOMENT I ACKNOWLEDGED DIFFERENT EMOTIONS
trainval/ynSrWmoq7Is/50005 I JUST KEPT TALKING
trainval/ynSrWmoq7Is/50006 THEN I SOUGHT THE DICTIONARY
trainval/ynSrWmoq7Is/50007 SO I NEEDED TO START CONSULTING IN MYSELF AND TRUSTING MYSELF MORE
trainval/YO0lbdhF30g/50001 BUT I QUESTION THAT THAT'S QUESTIONABLE
trainval/YO0lbdhF30g/50002 NOW IMAGINE THAT THAT HORRIBLE MOMENT IS RECORDED OR RECOUNTED AND PLACED ON THE INTERNET
trainval/YO0lbdhF30g/50004 WE'RE NOT HANDLING OUT OUR EMAIL PASSWORDS FOR A REASON
trainval/YO0lbdhF30g/50005 MAYBE MR GONZALEZ DESERVES A FRESH START
trainval/YO0lbdhF30g/50006 AND IT'S A HARD BALANCE AND IT'S A HARD CALL TO MAKE
trainval/YO0lbdhF30g/50007 BUT HERE YOU HAVE THAT GOVERNMENTAL BURDEN AND ITS SHIFTED ONTO A CORPORATION
trainval/YO0lbdhF30g/50009 UK WHICH IS THE BRITISH GOOGLE
trainval/YO0lbdhF30g/50010 YOU JUST TYPE IN GOOGLE
trainval/YO0lbdhF30g/50012 AND TYPE IN THE SAME SEARCH TERMS AND YOU'LL GET DIFFERENT RESULTS WHICH TAKE YOU TO EXACTLY WHERE YOU WANT TO
trainval/YO0lbdhF30g/50013 IT SAID YOU HAVE TO AMEND THE AMERICAN THE AUSTRALIAN EVERY OTHER GOOGLE SO IT CAN'T BE GOT AROUND
trainval/YO0lbdhF30g/50014 BUT IT'S REALLY NOT BECAUSE WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS THAT EU LAW SHOULD APPLY EVERYWHERE
trainval/YO0lbdhF30g/50015 SO THE CORE OBJECTION TO THE RIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN IS THAT NO MATTER
trainval/YO0lbdhF30g/50017 THEY DON'T WANT TO DO THIS THEY'RE BURDENED WITH IT
trainval/YO0lbdhF30g/50018 BUT TO THEM I SAY THIS YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS UNNATURAL
trainval/YO0lbdhF30g/50019 SO IN THE CONTEXT OF US TRYING TO DEAL WITH THAT TRAGEDY PEOPLE WERE LOOKING AT THE BOWLER SEAN ABBOTT AND
trainval/YO0lbdhF30g/50020 AND THIS IS A REALLY POIGNANT EXAMPLE OF PROBABLY THE STRONGEST CASE FOR THE RIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN OR MAYBE IT IS ONE OF THOSE
trainval/YO0lbdhF30g/50021 BUT THESE VALUES ONLY MEAN SOMETHING BECAUSE OF THE METAPHYSICAL PROPOSITION THAT WE HAVE FREE WILL
trainval/YO0lbdhF30g/50022 AND WHEN EMBARRASSING THINGS HAPPEN WE CAN CHOOSE TO FORGET
trainval/YO0lbdhF30g/50023 AND FREE WILL THAT GREAT GIFT THAT ESSENTIAL CONDITION OF OUR HUMANITY
trainval/YO0lbdhF30g/50024 BUT I'M CONFIDENT THAT NATURE WILL FIND A WAY
trainval/Yo5cKRmJaf0/50001 WHAT DOES THE TED AUDIENCE HOPE TO GET FROM THIS
trainval/Yo5cKRmJaf0/50002 A FLEETING MOMENT OF WONDER
trainval/Yo5cKRmJaf0/50003 A SENSE THAT MAYBE IT'S ALL GOING TO WORK OUT AFTER ALL
trainval/Yo5cKRmJaf0/50004 WE'RE TOLD THAT NOT ONLY IS CHANGE ACCELERATING BUT THAT THE PACE OF CHANGE IS ACCELERATING
trainval/Yo5cKRmJaf0/50005 THE FUTURE ON OFFER IS ONE IN WHICH EVERYTHING CAN CHANGE SO LONG AS EVERYTHING STAYS THE SAME
trainval/Yo5cKRmJaf0/50006 THIS IS INCREDIBLY CONSERVATIVE
trainval/Yo5cKRmJaf0/50007 BOTH CAN BE MUCH MORE INTELLIGENT
trainval/Yo5cKRmJaf0/50008 ANOTHER FUTURISM IS POSSIBLE
trainval/Yo5cKRmJaf0/50009 AND WORSE IS WHEN ECONOMICS IS DEBATED LIKE METAPHYSICS AS IF ANY REAL SYSTEM IS JUST A BAD EXAMPLE OF THE IDEAL
trainval/Yo5cKRmJaf0/50010 COMMUNISM IN THEORY WAS AN EGALITARIAN UTOPIA
trainval/yoAqA6vgnCQ/50001 THAT'S THE PROBLEM
trainval/yoAqA6vgnCQ/50002 AND THAT THERE'S A NECESSITY TO BE GOOD AT THOSE TO BE SMART
trainval/yoAqA6vgnCQ/50003 AND THE WORST
trainval/yoAqA6vgnCQ/50004 THE LESS I LIKED MATH AND SCIENCE THE MORE I LIKED HISTORY AND LITERATURE
trainval/yOc9mFvusDg/50001 LIFT AIR SPEED DRAG CENTER OF GRAVITY
trainval/yOc9mFvusDg/50002 I NEEDED TO MAKE IT
trainval/yOc9mFvusDg/50003 EVERYTHING EVERYTHING IS INTERESTING
trainval/yOc9mFvusDg/50004 WE KNOW THAT THE SCHOOL THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE MAKING IN MADRID IS GOING TO BE NOTHING LIKE THE SCHOOL THAT WE HAVE
trainval/yOc9mFvusDg/50005 EDUCATION SHOULD BE THE FIRST THING
trainval/yOc9mFvusDg/50006 WE OWE IT TO CHILDREN TO CREATE A WORLD THAT IS MORE ENGAGING
trainval/yOc9mFvusDg/50007 THANK YOU SO MUCH
trainval/yOc9mFvusDg/50008 STRANGE AND WONDERFUL THINGS BEGAN TO HAPPEN AT OUR SCHOOL
trainval/yOc9mFvusDg/50009 AND AS WE WATCHED WHAT WE WERE DOING AND LOOKED AT THE KINDS OF ENGAGEMENT WE WERE GETTING FROM THE CHILDREN WE REALIZED WE
trainval/YodRXxzhb7s/50001 SO THEY ARE PARTLY PREDICTABLE BUT THERE'S A LOT OF RANDOMNESS AND UNCERTAINTY INSIDE
trainval/YodRXxzhb7s/50002 FOR EXAMPLE 130000 ARTICLES FIVE PRODUCTIZES THREE STORAGE LOCATIONS TWO PREDICTIONS
trainval/yP2niXStKVQ/50001 AND TODAY I WILL ALSO SHARE MY TEDX EXPERIENCE WITH THEM
trainval/yP2niXStKVQ/50002 I HAVE A LOT OF FOLLOWERS TO BE HONEST
trainval/yP2niXStKVQ/50003 YOU ONLY SEE A NUMBER BUT BEHIND THAT NUMBER THERE ARE PEOPLE WITH REAL FACES REAL FEELINGS AND REAL
trainval/yP2niXStKVQ/50004 AND I KNOW IT CAN BE HARD TO IMAGINE THAT
trainval/yP2niXStKVQ/50005 AND I THOUGHT WE ALL HAVE PROBLEMS AND THAT'S OK
trainval/yP2niXStKVQ/50006 SO I DID IT AND TO BE HONEST IN THE BEGINNING I WAS SCARED I WAS SCARED OF THE REACTION OF OTHER PEOPLE
trainval/yP2niXStKVQ/50007 WELL THIS IS VLOGGING
trainval/yP2niXStKVQ/50008 THEN YOU ALSO NEED TO DO THAT
trainval/yP2niXStKVQ/50009 IT'S LIKE HELPING A FRIEND
trainval/yP2niXStKVQ/50010 THEY HELP ME BUT I ALSO HELP THEM
trainval/yP2niXStKVQ/50011 I DO THIS VERY OFTEN
trainval/yP2niXStKVQ/50013 I'M SO PROUD OF YOU PLEASE DON'T GIVE UP
trainval/yP2niXStKVQ/50015 THEY MET EACH OTHER ONLINE BUT SOME OF THEM ALSO MET EACH OTHER OFFLINE AND MADE FRIENDS
trainval/Yp3kmJ4kjHQ/50001 DO LIFE SCIENCES HAVE DRAMA
trainval/yPGwA7t6bpI/50001 AT THE WORST EXTREME MANY TRADITIONAL SOCIETIES GET RID OF THEIR ELDERLY IN ONE OF FOUR
trainval/yPGwA7t6bpI/50002 IT HAPPENS MAINLY UNDER TWO CONDITIONS
trainval/yPGwA7t6bpI/50003 THIS SUBJECT CONSTITUTES JUST ONE CHAPTER OF MY LATEST BOOK WHICH COMPARES TRADITIONAL
trainval/yPGwA7t6bpI/50004 AND TO MAKE BETTER USE OF THEIR VALUE
trainval/yPGwA7t6bpI/50005 OLDER PEOPLE HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE
trainval/yq3TQoMjXTw/50001 YOU SEE HISTORY'S RICH IN IRONY
trainval/yq3TQoMjXTw/50002 THEY WENT RIGHT IN HERE
trainval/yq3TQoMjXTw/50003 I WAS A YOUNG MAN AT THE TIME
trainval/yq3TQoMjXTw/50004 THAT'S FOR LITTLE CHILDREN
trainval/yq3TQoMjXTw/50005 WE ARE BIG PEOPLE AND WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR SOCIETY
trainval/yq3TQoMjXTw/50007 I READ A LOT OF SPY NOVELS AND STUFF
trainval/yq3TQoMjXTw/50009 TT AND WE HAVE THE WE ARE THE LEADERS IN THE STRUGGLE TO PRODUCE A NEW PUBLIC PROCUREMENT SYSTEM ABOUT HOW
trainval/yq3TQoMjXTw/50011 THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE IS THE NEXT TOWER OVER
trainval/yq3TQoMjXTw/50012 WHAT ARE THE FIGURES HE'S RELYING ON
trainval/yq3TQoMjXTw/50013 THAT IS ABOUT THREE AND A HALF BILLION U
trainval/yq3TQoMjXTw/50014 I'M ON A POINT
trainval/yq3TQoMjXTw/50015 WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITHIN JCC
trainval/yq3TQoMjXTw/50018 DISCARD THE SECOND MYTH IT IS A BIG THING
trainval/yq3TQoMjXTw/50019 IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM
trainval/yq3TQoMjXTw/50020 IT'S AN ECONOMIC CRIME
trainval/yq3TQoMjXTw/50021 IF IT IS I HAVE TO GO TO COURT PERSONALLY I WILL DO THAT
trainval/yqc9zX04DXs/50001 AND AT EACH THRESHOLD THE GOING GETS TOUGHER
trainval/yqU0SsbENgE/50001 HOW CAN WE DREAM BIG WHEN WE CAN ONLY DREAM FOR THE SPECIFIC THING VISIBLE TO US
trainval/yqU0SsbENgE/50002 A TRUE DREAM IS NOT MEASURABLE
trainval/yqU0SsbENgE/50003 SOMETIMES THEY DON'T EVEN SEEM ATTAINABLE
trainval/yqU0SsbENgE/50004 ESPECIALLY ON YOUR OWN
trainval/yqU0SsbENgE/50005 BY HAVING A SO CALLED UNREACHABLE DREAM WE CAN WORK TO CREATE A BETTER SOCIETY IT ASSISTS US IN
trainval/yqU0SsbENgE/50006 BUT THESE ARE THE DREAMERS THE THINKERS I THINK WE NEED FOR SOCIETY TO PROGRESS
trainval/yqU0SsbENgE/50007 SO LET'S BEGIN RIGHT NOW
trainval/Yr0eW6PbmOs/50001 I DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT
trainval/Yr0eW6PbmOs/50002 WE HAVE OUR THEORIES BUT WE ARE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO PROVE OUR THEORIES SO OUR JOB IS TO TRY AND
trainval/yr6khSQOk0s/50001 LET'S JUST THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH PROTEIN IS IN A SINGLE CELL
trainval/yr6khSQOk0s/50002 SO INSTEAD OF EXCLUSIVELY SYNTHESIZING PROTEINS IN THE CELL BODY WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS TO
trainval/yr6khSQOk0s/50003 SO THE PROBE WILL BIND SPECIFICALLY
trainval/YraU52j3y8s/50001 OR WORSE IF YOU SAY WOMAN PEOPLE ON THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE THINK YOU'RE ASKING FOR SPECIAL TREATMENT
trainval/YraU52j3y8s/50002 BECAUSE YEAR AFTER YEAR I WAS ONE OF FEWER AND FEWER AND NOW OFTEN THE ONLY WOMAN IN A ROOM
trainval/YraU52j3y8s/50003 IT WILL END YOUR BUSINESS CAREER
trainval/YraU52j3y8s/50004 I SAID ON THE TED STAGE
trainval/YraU52j3y8s/50005 IT'S ALWAYS SO NICE TO LOOK OUT AND SEE SO MANY WOMEN
trainval/YraU52j3y8s/50006 IT WAS CHOCK FULL OF DATA AND FIGURES I HAD THREE PAGES ON MATRILINEAL MAASAI
trainval/YraU52j3y8s/50007 I GOT THIS GREAT ONE OF THE FIRST LETTERS I GOT WAS FROM A WOMAN WHO SAID THAT SHE WAS OFFERED A REALLY BIG
trainval/YraU52j3y8s/50008 I CERTAINLY HAVE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH
trainval/YraU52j3y8s/50009 IF YOU'RE A MAN YOU'LL HAVE TO REPRESENT YOUR GENDER
trainval/YraU52j3y8s/50010 THAT WOULD'VE BEEN GREAT
trainval/YraU52j3y8s/50011 I MET ONE OF THEM I WAS IN BEIJING
trainval/YraU52j3y8s/50012 THE KIND OF PARTNERS THEY WANT IF AT ALL
trainval/YraU52j3y8s/50013 RIGHT WHICH I ADMIT I DO
trainval/YraU52j3y8s/50014 BECAUSE I THINK WHEN THE BOOK FIRST CAME OUT MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT WELL THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT HANDBOOK FOR YOUNG WOMEN
trainval/YraU52j3y8s/50015 PURSUING THE CORPORATE WORLD
trainval/YraU52j3y8s/50016 AND IT TURNS OUT EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD WOMEN NEED MORE SELF CONFIDENCE BECAUSE THE WORLD TELLS US WE'RE NOT EQUAL TO
trainval/YraU52j3y8s/50017 THAT IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH THAT IT'S NOT CHANGING QUICKLY ENOUGH
trainval/YraU52j3y8s/50018 IF YOU ARE A BLACK WOMAN 64 CENTS
trainval/yrcaHGqTqHk/50002 BRIC COUNTRY MEANS BRAZIL RUSSIA INDIA AND CHINA
trainval/yrcaHGqTqHk/50003 IT BECAME THE MEDIA PLATFORM OF 300 MILLION READERS
trainval/yrcaHGqTqHk/50004 SO WHEN SOME VERY POLITICAL EXCITING MOMENTS HAPPENED YOU CAN
trainval/yrcaHGqTqHk/50005 SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN BEHIND IT
trainval/YrSpoWSKK1Q/50001 I CAN'T PROMISE YOU THIS
trainval/YrSpoWSKK1Q/50002 IT'S ACTUALLY THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET THINGS RIGHT
trainval/YrSpoWSKK1Q/50003 AS CHILDREN WE'RE EVEN EXPECTED TO MAKE THEM
trainval/YrSpoWSKK1Q/50004 LANGUAGES ARE OFTEN PERCEIVED TO BE THE GREAT UNKNOWN
trainval/YrtANPtnhyg/50001 WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT DYNAMIC THINGS GOING AROUND
trainval/yRUCU5FsvTY/50001 AND MOST RECENTLY WE'VE ACTUALLY DEVELOPED OUR FIRST OCCULUS RIFT EXPERIENCE WITH A COMPANY
trainval/yRUCU5FsvTY/50002 BUT AS I WAS PLANNING OUR FUTURE STRATEGIES AND HOW WE WOULD HELP DEVELOP THE VIRTUAL REALITY
trainval/yRUCU5FsvTY/50003 I HAD THIS FEELING THAT IT WAS LIKE 1994 WHEN NETSCAPE THE FIRST COMMERCIAL WEB BROWSER
trainval/yRUCU5FsvTY/50004 AND THIS FEELING MADE ME PAUSE AND TAKE STOCK
trainval/yRUCU5FsvTY/50005 AND SO WHAT I WANT TO DO NOW IS EXTRACT THE LESSONS OF THE INTERNET EXPERIENCE OF THE PAST
trainval/yRUCU5FsvTY/50006 I WANT YOU GUYS TO LOOK AROUND YOU LOOK AT THE STAGE LOOK AT WHAT'S IN FRONT OF YOU
trainval/yRUCU5FsvTY/50007 IT'S VIRTUAL REALITY
trainval/yRUCU5FsvTY/50008 IN EFFECT ON THE INTERNET WE ALL SEE A DIFFERENT VERSION OF REALITY
trainval/yRUCU5FsvTY/50009 THE ADVENT OF THE INTERNET WAS SUPPOSED TO BRING THIS DEMOCRATIZED
trainval/yRUCU5FsvTY/50011 WE KNOW THAT AS WE MOVE INTO A VR SATURATED WORLD THIS WILL BE PART OF THAT
trainval/yRUCU5FsvTY/50012 SO NETWORK EFFECTS EXPLAIN WHY SO FEW FIRMS DOMINATE THE INTERNET
trainval/yRUCU5FsvTY/50013 WELL I THINK VR IS GOING TO EVOLVE IN WAYS THAT WE CAN'T ANTICIPATE
trainval/yRUCU5FsvTY/50014 NOW WITH VR WE'RE TASKED WITH A DESIGN CHALLENGE
trainval/yRUCU5FsvTY/50015 THE STUFF THAT I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
trainval/yRUCU5FsvTY/50016 SO IF WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT WE NEED TO WORK AT IT
trainval/yRUCU5FsvTY/50017 AND I WANT HIM TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS AUGMENTED REALITY HE'S GROWING UP TO EXPERIENCE
trainval/yRUCU5FsvTY/50018 I DON'T WANT HIM TO BE SOME KIND OF UNAWARE EXPLOITED PARTICIPANT IN A
trainval/yRUCU5FsvTY/50019 FREE HAS A PRICE
trainval/yRUCU5FsvTY/50020 OR THEY ARE FOR SALE BUT ONLY ON MY TERMS
trainval/YrZThoSoSis/50001 BUT AS I SEARCHED AROUND IN THE DARKNESS I REALIZED I WAS ACTUALLY PARALYZED BY ALL OF THE CHOICES THAT I
trainval/YsASJTeHJ6A/50001 THAT'S WHERE THE BOOKS ARE
trainval/YsASJTeHJ6A/50002 THAT'S WHERE THE HEART AND SOUL OF THE SCHOOL IS
trainval/YsASJTeHJ6A/50004 I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST LIKE A SAYING BUT IT ACTUALLY EXISTS I GUESS
trainval/YsASJTeHJ6A/50005 JUST DO A LOGO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION AND THEN YOU'RE OUT AND YOU FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF
trainval/YsASJTeHJ6A/50006 MEET YOU AFTER SCHOOL DOWN AT OWL
trainval/YsASJTeHJ6A/50007 I LIKE THAT RIGHT
trainval/YsASJTeHJ6A/50009 SO OTHER THINGS RIGHT
trainval/YsASJTeHJ6A/50010 AND THEN LOOK AT THIS
trainval/YsASJTeHJ6A/50011 IT'S LIKE THE EYE OF THE OWL
trainval/YsASJTeHJ6A/50012 THEY WERE TIRED OF THEM
trainval/YsASJTeHJ6A/50014 LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH THAT
trainval/YsASJTeHJ6A/50015 AND THEY WOULD GO AND INSTALL THESE
trainval/YsASJTeHJ6A/50016 IT JUST WAS THE GREATEST THING
trainval/YsASJTeHJ6A/50017 AND I SAID NO
trainval/YsASJTeHJ6A/50018 SO REALLY NICE HAVING YOU HERE
trainval/YsASJTeHJ6A/50020 I WAS JUST FOCUSED ON A FOOT AHEAD OF ME AS FAR AS I COULD REACH WITH MY OWN HANDS
trainval/ysln0YyjUok/50001 IT'S A PRANK BUT IT'S A PRANK THAT GIVES SOMEBODY A GREAT STORY TO TELL
trainval/ysln0YyjUok/50002 AND HER REACTION INSPIRED ME TO DO A SECOND ANNUAL NO PANTS SUBWAY RIDE
trainval/ysln0YyjUok/50003 AND WE'VE CONTINUED TO DO IT EVERY YEAR
trainval/ysln0YyjUok/50004 THE NEXT PROJECT I WANT TO SHOW WAS GIVEN TO ME IN AN EMAIL FROM A STRANGER
trainval/ysln0YyjUok/50005 IT'S THAT THERE IS NO POINT AND THAT THERE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A POINT
trainval/ysln0YyjUok/50006 WE DON'T NEED A REASON
trainval/ysln0YyjUok/50007 ONE THING THE MANAGERS WERE TRYING TO DO WAS TO TRACK DOWN OUR CAMERAS
trainval/ysln0YyjUok/50008 AND THEY CAUGHT A COUPLE OF MY GUYS WHO HAD HIDDEN CAMERAS IN DUFFEL BAGS
trainval/YSmJDnSemqY/50001 HE SUBSCRIBED ME FOUR PILLS OF CIALIS WHICH IS AN ERECTION ENHANCING DRUG JUST LIKE VIAGRA IN ORDER TO
trainval/YSmJDnSemqY/50002 AND NOT ONLY DID I FIND OUT OR GOT AWARENESS FOR THE FACT THAT THE BRAIN IS ACTUALLY
trainval/YSmJDnSemqY/50003 COUNTLESS EXPERIENCES ONLINE AND FIRST STUDIES PAINT A DIFFERENT PICTURE WITH THE RESULT
trainval/YSmJDnSemqY/50004 AFTER A COUPLE OF WEEKS WHEN I FELT READY TO TEST MY PROGRESS I NOTICED THAT DESPITE THE TIME
trainval/YSmJDnSemqY/50005 FOR EXAMPLE PORNOGRAPHY LIMIT SEXUALITY TO A PASSIVE AND VOYEURISTIC PERSPECTIVE
trainval/YSmJDnSemqY/50006 THE POST MODERN VERSION OF THE SHADOWS IN PLATO'S CAVE
trainval/YSQSLapD3c0/50001 I AM ALWAYS RIGHT BEHIND YOU
trainval/YSQSLapD3c0/50002 HE SOLD ME TO THE MOST VIOLENT GANG IN COLUMBUS OHIO
trainval/YSQSLapD3c0/50003 THAT ENCOURAGED ME AND EMPOWERED ME TO THE POINT WHERE I WANTED TO
trainval/YSQUrUZ6ZTE/50001 HE WAS SAVING THE WORLD SO I WANTED TO SAVE THE WORLD
trainval/ySrroSgNk4o/50004 DOING SO IS THE FIRST STEP IN OVERCOMING THE ALL TOO COMMON PARADIGM OF
trainval/YsUAEFJsOdA/50001 IT WAS FIRST USED BY SOMEBODY NAMED HAVELOCK ELLIS WHO WAS A BRITISH SEXOLOGIST WHO TALKED ABOUT SELF LOVE IN A
trainval/YsUAEFJsOdA/50002 THE SECOND FORM OF NARCISSISM WHICH MOST OF YOU PROBABLY DON'T THINK OF UNLESS YOU ARE IN THE CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
trainval/YsUAEFJsOdA/50003 SO WE TALK ABOUT THESE SOMETIMES AS COVERT NARCISSISTS BECAUSE THEY ARE HARD TO SPOT YOU DON'T REALLY SEE THEM OUT THERE
trainval/YsUAEFJsOdA/50004 SOMETIMES WE TALK ABOUT THEM AS SHY NARCISSISTS BECAUSE THEY ARE SHY SOMETIMES AS BASEMENT NARCISSISTS AS
trainval/YsUAEFJsOdA/50006 HIGH FIVE DADDY
trainval/YsUAEFJsOdA/50007 YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT HOW AWESOME I AM
trainval/YsUAEFJsOdA/50008 AND THIS IS RELATIVELY RARE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ONE OR TWO PERCENT OF THE POPULATION AT ANY ONE TIME
trainval/YsUAEFJsOdA/50009 EVENTUALLY NARCISSUS STUMBLED AND SAW HIMSELF IN A POOL OF WATER
trainval/YsUAEFJsOdA/50010 IT SORT OF WORKS
trainval/YsUAEFJsOdA/50011 PEOPLE WHO ARE NARCISSISTIC HAVE MORE FRIENDS OR FOLLOWERS OR LINKS IN SOCIAL MEDIA
trainval/YsUAEFJsOdA/50012 THEY TEND TO BE MORE ACTIVE
trainval/YsUAEFJsOdA/50013 HE IMMEDIATELY FELL IN LOVE WITH HIS REFLECTION AND FROZE
trainval/YsUAEFJsOdA/50014 AND THEN I THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND I THOUGHT OH MY GOD
trainval/YsUAEFJsOdA/50015 SHE IS A GENIUS
trainval/YsUAEFJsOdA/50016 SO IN THE OLD DAYS IF YOU WANTED TO DO THE KYLIE JENNER REALITY SHOW YOU
trainval/YsUAEFJsOdA/50017 HE DIED THERE
trainval/YsUAEFJsOdA/50018 SHE JUST GOT ON HER PHONE FILMED HERSELF SENT IT RIGHT TO HER FANS WHICH IS JUST AMAZING IT'S AN AMAZING
trainval/YsUAEFJsOdA/50019 BUT OTHERS HAVE USED THIS TO REALLY POSITIVE ENDS
trainval/YsUAEFJsOdA/50020 AND IN THIS PLACE A FLOWER GREW A DAYLILY WHICH TODAY WE CALL THE NARCISSUS
trainval/YsUAEFJsOdA/50021 THE TERM NARCISSISM OR SELF LOVE CAME TO PSYCHOLOGY IN A COUPLE WAYS
trainval/YsUAEFJsOdA/50022 AND THE IDEA WAS WRITE YOUR SPECIAL TALENT
trainval/YsUAEFJsOdA/50023 I SAID YEAH I DON'T KNOW
trainval/YsUAEFJsOdA/50024 I DON'T HAVE A SPECIAL TALENT
trainval/YsUAEFJsOdA/50025 AND MY WIFE SAID I DON'T HAVE A SPECIAL TALENT
trainval/YsUAEFJsOdA/50026 AND IN FACT I MEAN THE BEST WAY I THINK ABOUT EGO IS IT'S A TOOL IN YOUR TOOL BOX
trainval/Ysxz5Ug70G0/50001 I DIDN'T KNOW IT WOULD HAPPEN SO QUICK AT EIGHT
trainval/Ysxz5Ug70G0/50002 LIKE HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT'S THE TIME
trainval/Ysxz5Ug70G0/50003 HUMANS ARE SO PRIVATE
trainval/Ysxz5Ug70G0/50004 WOULD THAT EVER HAPPEN
trainval/Ysxz5Ug70G0/50005 AND THEN THEY BECOME TADPOLES AND FROGS
trainval/Ysxz5Ug70G0/50006 SHE GOES WHAT ABOUT DOGS
trainval/YsYHqfk0X2A/50001 BUT WHAT FASCINATED ME MORE IS THAT MADDIE'S CURIOSITY TOOK HER TO A NEW LEVEL
trainval/YsYHqfk0X2A/50002 AS IF WHAT WE ARE DOING ONE DAY WILL SAVE LIVES
trainval/YsYHqfk0X2A/50003 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/ytJyT9oDEm4/50001 AND WHEN THE TIME HAS COME TOWARDS THE END OF THE PREGNANCY THE BABY DECIDES
trainval/yTR4sADS4qM/50001 GOOGLE IS A COMPANY BORN OF IDEALISM
trainval/yTR4sADS4qM/50003 AND SOMETIMES IT GETS BIG ENOUGH TO BECOME OFFICIAL
trainval/yTR4sADS4qM/50004 AND HE CALLS THEM LEVEL 5 LEADERS
trainval/yTR4sADS4qM/50005 AND MATTHIEU'S HAPPINESS MEASURE IS OFF THE CHARTS
trainval/yTR4sADS4qM/50006 AND ONE OF OUR MOST POPULAR MANAGERS JOKES THAT THIS IS WHAT HE SAYS GOOGLE IS A PLACE WHERE
trainval/yTR4sADS4qM/50007 IN OTHER WORDS COMPASSION IS THE WAY TO GROW LEVEL 5 LEADERS
trainval/yTR4sADS4qM/50008 IT CREATES A VIBRANT ENERGETIC COMMUNITY WHERE PEOPLE ADMIRE AND RESPECT EACH OTHER
trainval/Ytw0I6ytRto/50001 THEY BURY THEIR DEAD THEY EDUCATE THE NEXT OF KIN THEY HAVE SOCIAL KNITS THAT ARE VERY CLOSE
trainval/Ytw0I6ytRto/50002 AND THERE THEY SURVIVED ON THE MAINLAND UNTIL ABOUT 10000 YEARS AGO AND ACTUALLY SURPRISINGLY ON THE SMALL
trainval/Ytw0I6ytRto/50003 PROBABLY PLEISTOCENE OVERKILL SO THE LARGE GAME HUNTERS THAT TOOK THEM DOWN
trainval/Ytw0I6ytRto/50004 AND IT'S PROBABLY SURPRISING TO MANY OF YOU SITTING IN THIS ROOM THAT IT'S NOT THE TIME THAT MATTERS IT'S NOT
trainval/Ytw0I6ytRto/50005 BUT I'LL ALSO GET ALL THE BACTERIA THAT ONCE LIVED WITH THE MAMMOTH AND MORE COMPLICATED I'LL GET ALL THE DNA
trainval/Ytw0I6ytRto/50006 SO THE BACTERIA THE FUNGI AND SO ON AND SO FORTH
trainval/Ytw0I6ytRto/50007 IF YOU WOULD ASK ME TEN YEARS AGO WETHER OR NOT WE WOULD EVER BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY SEQUENCE THE GENOME OF EXTINCT ANIMALS I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
trainval/Ytw0I6ytRto/50008 BUT WE'VE COME UP WITH VERY CLEVER WAYS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY DISCRIMINATE CAPTURE AND DISCRIMINATE THE MAMMOTH FROM THE NON
trainval/Ytw0I6ytRto/50009 WITH ADVANCES IN ANCIENT DNA TECHNOLOGY WE CAN ACTUALLY NOW START TO BEGIN TO SEQUENCE THE GENOMES OF THOSE
trainval/Ytw0I6ytRto/50011 IT LOOKS LIKE THEY WERE INTERBREEDING
trainval/Ytw0I6ytRto/50012 AND THIS IS NOT AN UNCOMMON FEATURE IN PROBOSCIDEANS BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT LARGE SAVANNA MALE ELEPHANTS WILL
trainval/Ytw0I6ytRto/50014 IF YOU WOULD ASK WETHER OR NOT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO REVIVE AN EXTINCT SPECIES I WOULD HAVE SAID PIPE DREAM
trainval/Ytw0I6ytRto/50015 WELL THAT IS NOT ACTUALLY THE CASE
trainval/Ytw0I6ytRto/50016 SO THIS LANDSCAPE WOULD BE EASILY ABLE TO HOUSE IT
trainval/Ytw0I6ytRto/50017 AND WHEN I BRING UP THIS WITH MY FRIENDS WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT
trainval/Ytw0I6ytRto/50018 WELL WHERE WOULD YOU PUT IT
trainval/yuD6ozE9rtc/50001 I WAS TOLD FIRSTHAND WHAT CAUSED ME TO BEHAVE THE WAY I DID BEFORE I COULD LUCID DREAM
trainval/YuEm03Ko0J8/50001 NOW I BELIEVE HIM
trainval/yuewc0SEn8M/50001 I SAID THAT I WAS JUST A MOM AS A WAY TO PROTECT MYSELF AND BEAT MY FELLOW SPEAKERS TO THE PUNCH IN JUDGING
trainval/yuewc0SEn8M/50002 EVER SAID THAT YOU WERE JUST A SOMETHING
trainval/yuewc0SEn8M/50003 IS TELLING ME THAT I DON'T MATTER IT'S REALLY EASY FOR ME TO SUMMON THE COURAGE TO VERBALLY FIGHT BACK
trainval/yvSQiSvuLLM/50001 DON'T DO IT ALONE
trainval/yvSQiSvuLLM/50002 THE ONLY CONSTANT IN LIFE IS REALLY CHANGE
trainval/yVwAodrjZMY/50001 SO I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME TO THE TED STAGE THE MAN BEHIND THOSE REVELATIONS
trainval/yVwAodrjZMY/50002 I WOULDN'T USE PATRIOT AND I WOULDN'T USE TRAITOR
trainval/yVwAodrjZMY/50003 SOME ARE RESPONSIBLE
trainval/yVwAodrjZMY/50004 THE WORLD'S LIBRARY IS AMAZON
trainval/yVwAodrjZMY/50005 I MEAN LOOK IF YOU'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG YOU'VE GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT
trainval/yVwAodrjZMY/50006 7 MILLION DOCUMENTS
trainval/yVwAodrjZMY/50007 SURELY THAT MAKES IT A PRICE WORTH PAYING
trainval/yVwAodrjZMY/50008 TIM ACTUALLY WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME UP AND SAY DO WE HAVE A MICROPHONE FOR TIM
trainval/YVzSVEJa5Gg/50001 AS MY SUPPORT SYSTEMS SLIPPED AWAY I REALIZED THAT MY DISEASE HAD SLOWLY BECOME
trainval/YVzSVEJa5Gg/50002 THIS CONTRADICTED MY REALITY
trainval/YVzSVEJa5Gg/50003 THIS NOTION OF FRIENDSHIP OF COMMUNITY WENT AGAINST WHAT I BELIEVED TO BE GOOD DIABETES
trainval/YVzSVEJa5Gg/50004 BUT I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG
trainval/YVzSVEJa5Gg/50005 THE FIRST ANSWER TO THIS CAME FROM OBSERVING HOW TYPE 1 DIABETICS USE LANGUAGE
trainval/YVzSVEJa5Gg/50006 TO BUILD THE STORY OF THE 1 CLUB I DREW PARALLELS BETWEEN THE LANGUAGE OF THE TYPE 1 DIABETES
trainval/YVzSVEJa5Gg/50007 AND THIS LED ME TO AN INCREDIBLE PLACE
trainval/YVzSVEJa5Gg/50008 I HOPE TYPE 1 DIABETICS WALK AWAY REMEMBERING ONE SIMPLE THING
trainval/YVzSVEJa5Gg/50009 THEY ARE THE FOUNDING FATHERS OF THE 1 CLUB
trainval/YWBwsS3lkXU/50001 AND ALL OF A SUDDEN PEOPLE STARTED TO OPEN UP
trainval/YWBwsS3lkXU/50003 EVERYBODY TALKED ABOUT SOMETHING THEY HAD ACHIEVED SOMETHING THAT WAS A CHALLENGE IN THEIR LIFE
trainval/YWBwsS3lkXU/50004 IN THAT MOMENT EVERYBODY ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE SEEN THEY WERE VULNERABLE
trainval/YWBwsS3lkXU/50005 I'LL SAY THIS
trainval/YWBwsS3lkXU/50006 MY WORK WAS INCREDIBLE I LOVED IT
trainval/YWBwsS3lkXU/50007 THEY WERE ALL INCREDIBLY EXPERIENCES THE PEOPLE I WORKED WITH THEY INSPIRED ME
trainval/YWBwsS3lkXU/50008 HOW CAN I GET MOTIVATED
trainval/YWBwsS3lkXU/50009 HOW CAN I STAY MOTIVATED
trainval/YWBwsS3lkXU/50010 BECAUSE OF THOSE CHEMICALS
trainval/YWBwsS3lkXU/50011 YOU KNOW INSPIRATION IT'S WHEN WE'RE NOT TRYING TO BECAME INSPIRED THAT WE ARE INSPIRED
trainval/YWBwsS3lkXU/50012 SO I SAT SARAH DOWN RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME
trainval/YWBwsS3lkXU/50013 I SAID ALRIGHT SARAH TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON
trainval/YWBwsS3lkXU/50015 NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR SOMEBODY SAY THAT
trainval/YWBwsS3lkXU/50016 WHAT HAPPENS NEXT RIGHT
trainval/YWBwsS3lkXU/50017 IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT
trainval/YWBwsS3lkXU/50018 CISCO IS AN AMAZING COMPANY THEY CREATE CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY BUT WHAT MAKES THEM SO GREAT AND THEY UNDERSTAND THIS
trainval/YWBwsS3lkXU/50019 THIS HAPPENED FOR WEEKS AND THEN FINALLY WE GOT TO THE POINT WHERE WE IT'S LIKE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET A THERAPIST INVOLVED
trainval/YWBwsS3lkXU/50020 THIS IS BAD
trainval/YWBwsS3lkXU/50021 AND IT WAS REALLY FUNNY
trainval/YWBwsS3lkXU/50022 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/YWBwsS3lkXU/50023 HE WAS VERY CONFUSED AND I COULD TELL
trainval/YWBwsS3lkXU/50024 SOMETHING'S UP WITH MY SON
trainval/ywgdCrcx6oM/50001 AT FIVE YEARS OLD THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT WITH THE NUMBER FIVE
trainval/ywgdCrcx6oM/50002 I ALSO ASKED YOU
trainval/YwSGTipx3As/50001 THERE ARE MANY THINGS OUT THERE THAT CAN BE AWESOME
trainval/YwSGTipx3As/50002 AND ALL THESE DISTRACTIONS MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO CAPTURE WHAT IS REALLY IN FRONT OF US
trainval/YwSGTipx3As/50003 ISN'T THAT TOO MUCH
trainval/YwSGTipx3As/50004 WE CHECK OUR SMARTPHONE 1500 TIMES PER WEEK
trainval/YwSGTipx3As/50005 AND NUMBER THREE
trainval/YwSGTipx3As/50006 AT LEAST IF WE DON'T RECOVER THE SENSE OF WONDER WE WON'T BE ABLE TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE
trainval/Yx2rjq1gSWA/50001 OFF COURSE I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT ANY NECESSARY THINGS I'M TRYING TO KEEP IT SERIOUS TODAY EVEN IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE DIFFICULT
trainval/Yx2rjq1gSWA/50002 BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE FEELING OF WINNING
trainval/Yx2rjq1gSWA/50003 JUST WHEN THINKING OF A LOVELY PERSON OR OF THE PROCESS ALL YOU GUYS LOVE I KNOW THAT
trainval/Yx2rjq1gSWA/50004 I INVENTED THE FIRST WORLDWIDE JEWELRY INCLUDING THAT ANCHORING TECHNIQUE AND THAT
trainval/Yx2rjq1gSWA/50005 ALL THAT JUST WITH THE POWER OF OUR THOUGHTS ISN'T THAT GREAT
trainval/yxC30tEjZk8/50001 WHEN DOING BRAND
trainval/yxC30tEjZk8/50002 AND THEY'LL CHOOSE TO EVOLVE THEIR PROMISE WHEN THEY WANT TO STAND FOR SOMETHING NEW OR THE MARKET IS NO LONGER RESPONDING TO THEIR
trainval/yxC30tEjZk8/50003 AND THERE ARE THREE PARTS TO A BRAND EVOLUTION PROCESS
trainval/yxC30tEjZk8/50004 THE FIRST IS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE COMPANY IS TRYING TO DO
trainval/yxC30tEjZk8/50005 THIS IS A WORD I LOVE YOU AND I PROBABLY KNOW WHAT IS STANDOUT DIFFERENT BUT THERE'S ANOTHER DEFINITION ACTUALLY COMES
trainval/yxC30tEjZk8/50006 WHY A TEAM FRAMEWORK
trainval/yxC30tEjZk8/50007 D ANALOGIES WORK REALLY WELL FOR ME AND WORKS WELL FOR HIM
trainval/yxC30tEjZk8/50008 AND ONCE THE ANALOGY LANDED HE RAN OFF IT WE TALKED ABOUT THE TEAMS THAT WE GREW UP ON AS KIDS I SAID I GREW UP ON A
trainval/YXrEVQFtJm0/50001 OUR MAIN AIM IS TO ERADICATE FOOD WASTE AND FEED HUNGRY MOUTHS
trainval/YXrEVQFtJm0/50002 WE HAD TO BE CLEVER ABOUT OUR FOOD
trainval/YXrEVQFtJm0/50003 I MEAN TO THIS DAY WE STILL EAT 6
trainval/YXrEVQFtJm0/50004 THIS CAME THIS MORNING FROM A MICHELIN STAR RESTAURANT
trainval/YXrEVQFtJm0/50005 WE NEED TO BE RESOURCEFUL WITH OUR FOOD WE NEED TO PLAN WHAT WE EAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OURSELVES WE'RE USING THE MOST OUT OF WHAT
trainval/YXSOxBfsvbk/50001 AND WHEN THEY ARRIVED THERE WAS TREMENDOUS INTEREST IN TRANSLATING THIS WISDOM INTO A EUROPEAN LANGUAGE
trainval/yXTtHmj1sr0/50001 AND IF THEY FREELY RECALLED SOME OF THE MEMORIES FROM THE FIRST SESSION THEY WERE IN AND IF THIS PERSON TALKED ABOUT
trainval/yXTtHmj1sr0/50002 SO I THINK THESE SLIDES I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU ON FICTION WILL ADDRESS THAT
trainval/YyBk55G7Keo/50001 I WAS BORN IN 1971
trainval/YyBk55G7Keo/50002 I KNOW I CAN DRIVE
trainval/YyBk55G7Keo/50003 AND FOR THE NEXT 11 YEARS I SWORE NOBODY WOULD EVER FIND OUT THAT I COULDN'T SEE BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE
trainval/YyBk55G7Keo/50004 I WAS 28 YEARS OLD
trainval/YyBk55G7Keo/50005 HARDLY APPROPRIATE AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME
trainval/YyBk55G7Keo/50006 HE THOUGHT I WAS MAD ENOUGH ANYWAY
trainval/YyBk55G7Keo/50007 I ALWAYS RUN IT PERFECTLY FINE
trainval/YyBk55G7Keo/50008 WHERE DID IT GO WRONG
trainval/YyBk55G7Keo/50009 WHY DIDN'T I UNDERSTAND
trainval/YyBk55G7Keo/50010 AND THEN I REMEMBER THINKING ABOUT THAT EYE SPECIALIST ASKING ME WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE
trainval/YyuScSjkGSs/50002 WE FOLLOW THE PLANTING CYCLES
trainval/YyuScSjkGSs/50003 WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I WORKED OUT IN COLORADO
trainval/yyW9W3e9VD0/50001 IT'S A REAL THING I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD IT
trainval/yyW9W3e9VD0/50002 BUT SHE WAS ALSO A MAVERICK IN HER USE OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE CLASSROOM
trainval/yyW9W3e9VD0/50003 SHE HAD TERMINAL BREAST CANCER
trainval/Yz1sNBv7oAo/50001 I'M FORTUNATE TO BE HAVING MORE AND MORE OF THESE MOMENTS
trainval/Yz1sNBv7oAo/50002 I'M NOT EVEN THERE YET I MEAN SAHARA BECK IS HARDLY A HOUSEHOLD NAME

trainval/YZa4sdIwV04/50001 ARE YOU RELIABLE
trainval/YZa4sdIwV04/50002 ARE YOU A CHEAT
trainval/YZa4sdIwV04/50003 IT ENABLES US TO CONSTRUCT EXTREMELY SOPHISTICATED NETWORKS OF ECONOMIC
trainval/YzhSmnGcSkE/50002 NOW I WILL SPECULATE
trainval/YzQDnTPuNZM/50001 BABBLING THROUGH EVERY SILENCE IN THE CONVERSATION TALKING ABOUT THE WEATHER AND THE TERRAIN
trainval/YzQDnTPuNZM/50002 IT IS NOT RE REWRITING HISTORY
trainval/z0HsPBKfhoI/50001 I'M NOT BUILDING A HAL
trainval/z0HsPBKfhoI/50002 CAN WE BUILD SYSTEMS THAT RECOGNIZE OBJECTS IDENTIFY EMOTIONS EMOTE THEMSELVES PLAY GAMES AND EVEN
trainval/z0HsPBKfhoI/50003 WE DON'T PROGRAM THEM
trainval/z0HsPBKfhoI/50004 WE TEACH THEM
trainval/z0HsPBKfhoI/50005 I DO NOT FEAR AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE HAND OF A LONE WOLF
trainval/z0HsPBKfhoI/50006 HOW SHALL I BEST ORGANIZE SOCIETY WHEN THE NEED FOR HUMAN LABOR DIMINISHES
trainval/z0HsPBKfhoI/50007 HOW MIGHT I EXTEND AND ENHANCE HUMAN LIFE THROUGH COGNITIVE HEALTHCARE
trainval/z0HsPBKfhoI/50008 HOW MIGHT I USE COMPUTING TO HELP TAKE US TO THE STARS
trainval/z0HsPBKfhoI/50009 AND THAT'S THE EXCITING THING
trainval/z0HsPBKfhoI/50010 NOW THERE ARE A LOT OF PIECES OF DR
trainval/z0USUSGggf8/50001 IT'S NOT A RELATIONSHIP
trainval/z19gIaUmIBU/50001 SOMETIMES LIFE PUTS YOU IN THESE SERENDIPITOUS SITUATIONS THAT CAN'T REALLY BE EXPLAINED
trainval/z19gIaUmIBU/50002 SAME CANCER SAME TREATMENT SAME PROBLEMS
trainval/z19gIaUmIBU/50003 THEY'VE GONE TO THE EDGE OF WHAT THEY COULD ENDURE AND THEY'VE RETURNED VICTORIOUSLY SO THAT MUST MEAN THAT THEY'RE FINISHED
trainval/z19gIaUmIBU/50004 I DIDN'T FIGHT ANY HARDER THAN JACE FOR SOME ARBITRARY REASON MY BODY RESPONDED BETTER TO CHEMOTHERAPY THAN HE DID
trainval/z19gIaUmIBU/50005 ANGER CAN MOTIVATE YOU
trainval/z19gIaUmIBU/50006 ANGER DESTROYS APATHY
trainval/z19gIaUmIBU/50007 THE CANCER ENDED UP RETURNING IN MY LUNGS
trainval/z19gIaUmIBU/50008 YEAH BUT IT'S GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH NOT HELPING ANYONE IS SO MUCH MONUMENTALLY
trainval/z19gIaUmIBU/50009 MUCH TO MY DISMAY THIS WASN'T AN ISOLATED INCIDENT
trainval/z19gIaUmIBU/50010 EVERYONE IS GOING THROUGH THEIR OWN BATTLES
trainval/z19gIaUmIBU/50011 UNHAPPINESS DEPRESSION UNEMPLOYMENT
trainval/z1KJAXM3xYA/50001 AND I WANT TO MAKE A TIME MACHINE
trainval/z1KJAXM3xYA/50002 I WAS ALWAYS SENDING MESSAGES TO MY FUTURE SELF USING TAPE RECORDERS
trainval/Z1R1z9ipFnM/50001 BUT THEN I GOT MY FIRST TASTE OF LIGHTING
trainval/Z1R1z9ipFnM/50002 THEN WE BROKE IT BACK DOWN TO SEE WHICH ELEMENTS MAKE UP THAT UNDERWATER LOOK
trainval/Z1R1z9ipFnM/50003 MAYBE BECAUSE UNLIKE NORMAL WE WERE BASING IT ON SOMETHING IN REAL LIFE OR MAYBE JUST BECAUSE WE HAD LOST OUR WAY
trainval/Z1R1z9ipFnM/50004 I GAVE MY INTRO AND I PLAYED THE JELLYFISH SCENE
trainval/Z1R1z9ipFnM/50005 AND THE DIRECTOR WAS SILENT FOR AN UNCOMFORTABLY LONG AMOUNT OF TIME
trainval/Z1R1z9ipFnM/50006 AND THEN THE PRODUCTION DESIGNER STARTED CLAPPING
trainval/Z1R1z9ipFnM/50007 AS HUMANS WE HAVE THE WHITE OF OUR EYE THE COLORED IRIS AND THE BLACK PUPIL
trainval/Z24sXLBnOu4/50001 WE DID THIS BECAUSE WE DECIDED TO CREATE THESE RECYCLING
trainval/Z24sXLBnOu4/50002 IF SOMEONE WANTED TO DISPOSE OF A PLASTIC WATER BOTTLE FOR INSTANCE AND THERE WAS A TRASH CAN
trainval/Z24sXLBnOu4/50003 THROUGH BEING OPEN TO CHANGE WITHIN OURSELVES AS WELL AS CHANGE OUTSIDE OF OURSELVES WE CAN
trainval/Z2hFbbG7t70/50001 AND SO AS AN ATHLETE YOU'RE LEFT ASKING YOURSELF WHAT DO I NEED TO DO TO BE SUCCESSFUL BOTH ATHLETICALLY
trainval/Z2hFbbG7t70/50002 SPORT IS A COMPETITIVE REWARD STRUCTURE
trainval/Z2Z3P8E0tos/50001 I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
trainval/Z2Z3P8E0tos/50002 AS YOU SEE KNOWING YOUR VALUES GUIDES YOU TO MAKE CHOICES IN YOUR LIFE
trainval/Z2Z3P8E0tos/50003 YOU CAN TAKE SOME NOTES
trainval/Z2Z3P8E0tos/50004 WHAT WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND IS TO IMAGINE THIS GREAT LIFE
trainval/z3kdILSEbQU/50001 BUT SOMETHING CHANGED FOR ME WHEN I MET MY WIFE
trainval/Z41BTeAU7DI/50001 AND BY THIS AGE WE SEE A REMARKABLE EVOLUTION IN ITS CAPACITY TO CONTROL MOVEMENT
trainval/Z41BTeAU7DI/50002 ALL IT TAKES FOR EXAMPLE IN THE SOUND DOMAIN IS EXPOSURE TO SOUND
trainval/Z41BTeAU7DI/50004 THEY ALL BECOME SPECIALIZED FOR THE TASK AT HAND
trainval/z4eSa6GXEsE/50001 AND HE SAID
trainval/z4eSa6GXEsE/50002 I WISH I COULD FLY THERE
trainval/z4eSa6GXEsE/50003 I WISH I COULD FLY
trainval/z4eSa6GXEsE/50004 CAN YOU MAYBE THINK BACK TO WHEN THAT WAS
trainval/z4eSa6GXEsE/50005 AND HE DREAMT OF BEING ABLE TO TRAVEL THE 48
trainval/z4fsN1DSEVk/50001 HOW DO I GET PEOPLE TO CARE
trainval/z4fsN1DSEVk/50002 IN MY HOMETOWN OF LINCOLN NEBRASKA
trainval/z4fsN1DSEVk/50003 WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO
trainval/z4fsN1DSEVk/50004 I'M 50 YEARS OLD MAYBE I HAVE ANOTHER 20 YEARS LEFT
trainval/z4kwU6z6ORg/50001 HOW ABOUT THAT
trainval/z4kwU6z6ORg/50002 BUT THE TIME THAT I M REFERRING TO HAPPENED 250 MILLIONS YEARS AGO
trainval/z4kwU6z6ORg/50003 AND WHAT THEY LEFT US
trainval/z4kwU6z6ORg/50004 WHEN YOU BREAK A BONE IT GROWS BACK
trainval/z4kwU6z6ORg/50005 BUT THEY CAN BE A BIT LIKE GEOLOGISTS
trainval/z4kwU6z6ORg/50006 I TRAINED AS A DOCTOR ABOUT 30 YEARS AGO
trainval/z4kwU6z6ORg/50007 I'D WORKED ABOUT 112 HOURS IN THIS WEEK
trainval/z4kwU6z6ORg/50008 MY EYELIDS FELT A LITTLE HEAVY I OPENED THEM AND I WAS ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD WITH A CAR SPEEDING
trainval/z4kwU6z6ORg/50009 THAT S WHAT I THOUGHT
trainval/z4kwU6z6ORg/50011 SO NOW WE'VE GOT THE INSIGHT
trainval/z4kwU6z6ORg/50012 THIS IS WHAT TO REMIND YOURSELF OF WHEN YOU RE IN A DIP
trainval/z4vmzTZ7qLA/50001 AND IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY ELON MUSKS'S COMPANY SPACEX WILL FROM NEXT YEAR FLY
trainval/z4vmzTZ7qLA/50002 FROM CROWDED CARRIAGEWAYS AND AROUND DINNER TABLES WHEN TIMES GET TOUGH WE
trainval/z5aAJGNSRHs/50001 AT ITS HEART PALLIATIVE MEDICINE IS ABOUT DELIVERING THE MOST COMPASSIONATE CARE WE CAN
trainval/z5aAJGNSRHs/50002 IT IS ABOUT ENSURING THAT WE ARE ADEQUATELY MANAGING THEIR PAIN AND THE PROGRESSION OF THEIR
trainval/z5aAJGNSRHs/50003 I'M A VETERINARIAN WHICH MEANS THAT THROUGHOUT MY LIFE MY SOLE FOCUS HAS ALWAYS
trainval/z5aAJGNSRHs/50004 OVER RECENT YEARS WE HAVE SEEN DRAMATIC CHANGES IN THE STANDARDS OF CARE THAT VETS CAN
trainval/z5aAJGNSRHs/50005 SO LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW WE IMPLEMENT THE IDEALS OF PALLIATIVE CARE FOR OUR PETS
trainval/z5aAJGNSRHs/50006 WE UNDERSTAND THAT GRIEF CAN BE OVERWHELMING SO WE HAVE A REGISTERED
trainval/z5aAJGNSRHs/50007 HOWEVER QUITE SOON AFTER GRADUATION I REALIZED THAT I ALSO REALLY CARED ABOUT
trainval/z5aAJGNSRHs/50008 THEN I DISPENSE THAT EXTRA PAIN RELIEF BECAUSE IN THAT PET'S LIFE
trainval/z5aAJGNSRHs/50009 IF MY ACTIONS TODAY WILL MAKE THEIR TOMORROW A LITTLE BETTER THEN THAT IS ABSOLUTELY AN
trainval/z5lZ9wciZQM/50001 IT'S CALLED WE FEEL FINE
trainval/z5lZ9wciZQM/50002 AND WHEN IT FINDS ONE OF THOSE PHRASES IT GRABS THE FULL SENTENCE UP TO THE PERIOD AND ALSO TRIES TO IDENTIFY DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
trainval/z5lZ9wciZQM/50003 SO REALLY EVEN CHALLENGING THE NOTION OF WHAT CAN BE CONSIDERED A STORY
trainval/z5lZ9wciZQM/50004 AND RECENTLY I'VE BECOME INTERESTED IN DIVING MUCH MORE DEEPLY INTO A SINGLE STORY
trainval/z5lZ9wciZQM/50005 AND THAT'S LED ME TO DOING SOME WORK WITH THE PHYSICAL WORLD NOT WITH THE INTERNET AND ONLY USING THE INTERNET AT THE VERY LAST MOMENT AS
trainval/z5lZ9wciZQM/50006 I PHOTOGRAPHED THAT ENTIRE EXPERIENCE AT FIVE MINUTE INTERVALS
trainval/z5lZ9wciZQM/50007 SO I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT EACH OF THOSE TODAY
trainval/z5lZ9wciZQM/50008 SO EVERY FIVE MINUTES I TOOK A PHOTOGRAPH
trainval/z5lZ9wciZQM/50009 WHEN I WAS AWAKE WITH THE CAMERA AROUND MY NECK
trainval/z5lZ9wciZQM/50010 THAT WAS THE FIRST CONCEPT HERE
trainval/z5lZ9wciZQM/50011 THE SECOND CONCEPT WAS TO USE THIS EXPERIENCE TO THINK ABOUT THE FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENTS OF ANY STORY
trainval/z5lZ9wciZQM/50013 BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT REAL LIFE IT'S NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL
trainval/z5lZ9wciZQM/50014 I MEAN IN REAL LIFE THINGS ARE MUCH MORE NUANCED AND COMPLEX AND THERE'S ALL OF THESE OVERLAPPING STORIES INTERSECTING AND TOUCHING EACH
trainval/z5lZ9wciZQM/50015 SO BHUTAN HAS THIS REALLY WACKY THING WHERE THEY BASE MOST OF THEIR HIGH LEVEL
trainval/z5lZ9wciZQM/50016 BUT YOU KNOW EVEN HOLDING ONE BALLOON IS LIKE KIND OF HAPPY
trainval/z5lZ9wciZQM/50017 AND THIS IS WHAT SHE SAID
trainval/z5lZ9wciZQM/50018 AND UP THERE THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PRAYER FLAGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE SPREAD OUT OVER THE YEARS
trainval/z5lZ9wciZQM/50019 AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY STILL FLYING UP THERE TODAY
trainval/z5ncIwCZDGU/50001 WHAT IF I GIVE IT A SHOT
trainval/z5ncIwCZDGU/50002 BUT JUST LIKE THE INNOVATIONS IN TECHNOLOGIES THAT STARTED IN GARAGES AND DORM ROOMS IN THE PAST MY PROJECT REALLY PICKED UP
trainval/Z6T37m4r3yo/50001 BUT IN MANY IMPORTANT WAYS THEY ARE BROKEN THEY ARE OUTDATED AND IT'S TIME TO CHANGE THEM
trainval/Z6T37m4r3yo/50002 BUT THERE'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT ROLE FOR THE GOVERNMENT
trainval/Z6T37m4r3yo/50003 50 A DAY A BUCK AND A HALF A MEAL
trainval/Z6T37m4r3yo/50004 FOR MOST BENEFICIARIES THE FOOD STAMP BENEFITS RUN OUT BY THE SECOND OR THIRD WEEK OF
trainval/Z6T37m4r3yo/50005 THAT'S THE FIRST THING
trainval/z9CabT4Kcz8/50001 WE GOT OTHER FRIENDS AND OTHER HIGH SCHOOLS INVOLVED AND WE ENDED UP HOSTING THE MIDWEST HIGH SCHOOL CROQUET
trainval/z9CabT4Kcz8/50002 WE BRING IN MONTHLY GUEST SPEAKERS
trainval/z9CabT4Kcz8/50003 WE DO CHARITY EVENTS
trainval/z9CabT4Kcz8/50004 IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A MOCK YACHT CLUB WHERE WE WORE SPERRYS AND TALK ABOUT BOATING AND JUST LIKE BE REALLY CHILL
trainval/z9CabT4Kcz8/50005 WE HAD SO MUCH INTEREST WE HAD TO HAVE END OF THE YEAR BANQUET WHERE EVERYONE IN ATTENDANCE GOT AN AWARD IT WAS A
trainval/z9CabT4Kcz8/50006 THE GREAT THING ABOUT A SIMPLE IDEA IS THAT YOU DON'T NEED A LOT TO ACCOMPLISH IT
trainval/z9CabT4Kcz8/50007 OUR GOAL WAS ONLY 50 DOLLARS SO REALLY WASN'T THAT HARD TO DO BUT TO BEING RIDICULOUS LIKE
trainval/z9CabT4Kcz8/50008 THEN WE LEARNED THAT HAMMOCKING ACTUALLY HAS HEALTH BENEFITS AND WE STARTED TO WORK WITH ACTUAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO TRACK SWAY
trainval/Z9dt5qlgO24/50001 WE'RE SEEING MASSIVE CHANGE WHETHER IT'S SOCIAL OR TECHNOLOGICAL EVERYTHING IS SPEEDING UP
trainval/Z9dt5qlgO24/50002 TODAY WE NEED COMPLEX PROBLEM SOLVERS
trainval/Z9dt5qlgO24/50003 WHETHER OR NOT THE TEACHER WANTS TO GIVE YOU THAT TIME THERE IS NO CHOICE THERE
trainval/Z9dt5qlgO24/50004 A REPORT CAME OUT IN THE EARLY 80'S CALLED
trainval/Z9dt5qlgO24/50005 OR DEMONSTRATING HER SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING AND MATH SKILLS BY DESIGNING A NEW MODEL
trainval/Z9dt5qlgO24/50006 THIS SORT OF NEW PARADIGM SYSTEM WILL HAVE PROJECTS THAT SUPPORT MEETING LEARNING REQUIREMENTS WHILE ALSO SUPPORTING
trainval/Z9dt5qlgO24/50007 WE OBSERVED HIM USING THE VIDEO GAME IN CLASS
trainval/Z9dt5qlgO24/50008 OF COURSE IT IS
trainval/Z9dt5qlgO24/50009 BUT I'VE SEEN THE SORT OF IMPACT THAT IT CAN HAVE I'VE SEEN A SCHOOL POPULATED WITH NOTHING BUT STUDENTS WHO WERE
trainval/Z9dt5qlgO24/50010 IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT
trainval/z9sa2ZAqHl0/50001 AN INFINITE NUMBER OF MONKEYS COULD NEVER WRITE THE WORKS OF SHAKESPEARE
trainval/z9sa2ZAqHl0/50002 THAT TO ME IS AN INCREDIBLE THING
trainval/z9sa2ZAqHl0/50003 THAT IS A WONDERFUL IDEA
trainval/z9sa2ZAqHl0/50004 YOU WON'T LIVE FOREVER
trainval/z9sa2ZAqHl0/50005 THIS IS A TERRIBLE THING EVEN THOUGH I UNDERSTAND PAIN
trainval/z9sa2ZAqHl0/50006 YOU I IMAGINE CAN DO MUCH BETTER THINGS WITH YOUR TIME
trainval/z9sa2ZAqHl0/50007 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/ZaSFy6RX3aE/50001 HOW CAN YOU DISTINGUISH ONE FROM ANOTHER
trainval/ZaSFy6RX3aE/50002 HOW DO YOU KNOW FOR WHICH ONE YOU NEED TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND FOR WHICH ONE YOU DON'T
trainval/ZaSFy6RX3aE/50003 YOU CAN'T WE AREN'T DONE YET
trainval/ZaSFy6RX3aE/50004 AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE DOING BLOOD TESTS WE ARE DOING EKGS TO DETECT ANY ELECTRICAL
trainval/ZaSFy6RX3aE/50005 TO ME THAT'S LIKE PLAYING RUSSIAN ROULETTE
trainval/ZaSFy6RX3aE/50006 AND THERE ARE SOME HOSPITALS THAT WOULD DO ANGIOGRAMS TO JUST MAKE SURE IT'S OK SO MANY
trainval/ZaSFy6RX3aE/50007 IS THE BLOOD SUGAR TOO HIGH
trainval/ZaSFy6RX3aE/50008 IS THE CHOLESTEROL TOO HIGH
trainval/ZaSFy6RX3aE/50009 ALL OF THESE THINGS NEED TO CHANGE ONCE YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE EARLY SIGNS OF PLAQUE BUILD UP
trainval/ZaSFy6RX3aE/50010 SO YOU WANT TO DISRUPT WHATEVER PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE DOING BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT THING IT'S
trainval/ZaSFy6RX3aE/50011 WELL WE ASK A VERY SIMPLE QUESTION
trainval/ZaSFy6RX3aE/50012 CAN WE OFFER THIS SERVICE TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL THAT DOES NOT HAVE THE
trainval/ZaSFy6RX3aE/50013 AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WE HELP THOSE PATIENTS WITH MILD OR MODERATE DISEASES TO RECOGNISE THAT
trainval/ZaSFy6RX3aE/50014 WE NEED TO SHARE THIS BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION
trainval/zaufonUBjoQ/50001 AND SHE SUDDENLY GAVE ME THAT
trainval/zaufonUBjoQ/50002 THAT'S WHY I'M HERE
trainval/zaufonUBjoQ/50003 YOU HAD BREAKFAST WHAT DID YOU DO AFTER THAT
trainval/zaufonUBjoQ/50004 AND IT SPARKED SOMETHING AMAZING WITHIN ME BECAUSE I STARTED TO SEE THINGS I WOULDN'T
trainval/zaufonUBjoQ/50005 I NEEDED A LOT MORE OF THAT
trainval/zaufonUBjoQ/50006 LIKE LIFE WAS A TREADMILL
trainval/zaufonUBjoQ/50007 BLAH ABOUT LIFE
trainval/zaufonUBjoQ/50008 AND THIS ONE DAY I HADN'T TAKEN MY GRATEFUL PHOTO FOR THE DAY AND I WAS SCANNING MY LIFE BASICALLY
trainval/zaufonUBjoQ/50009 I DUG OUT THE MAGAZINE AND I LOOKED AT IT AGAIN
trainval/zawpbVpu5nY/50001 AND THEN FROM THAT POINT ON IT WASN'T VERY HARD FOR ME TO FIND INSECURE ENVIRONMENTS TO WORK IN BECAUSE THE WORLD WAS
trainval/zawpbVpu5nY/50002 OUR SENSE OF ISOLATION GROWS BECAUSE OUR IMAGINATION GOES INTO OVERDRIVE ABOUT THE PEOPLE AND THE
trainval/zawpbVpu5nY/50003 MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS STEPPED FORWARD AND HELPED WITH PERMITS AND WITH CONVENING CIVIL SOCIETY
trainval/zawpbVpu5nY/50004 WE'VE PROVEN THAT THE HUMAN FAMILY CAN COME TOGETHER AND SEND A MESSAGE FAR BRIGHTER AND MORE
trainval/zawpbVpu5nY/50005 AND FOR SOME IT WAS TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THE OLDER AND THE YOUNGER GENERATION WHICH BY THE WAY IS SOMETHING THAT MANY FAITHS
trainval/ZB50BfYlsDc/50001 FOR MOST OF HUMAN HISTORY WE COULD GO NO FASTER THAN A HORSE OR A BOAT WITH A SAIL
trainval/ZB50BfYlsDc/50002 THEY'VE EXPANDED AND ENRICHED OUR LIVES
trainval/ZB50BfYlsDc/50003 COAL AND NATURAL GAS ARE CHEAPER THAN SOLAR AND WIND AND PETROLEUM IS CHEAPER THAN
trainval/ZB50BfYlsDc/50004 THERE IS NO GALVANIZING CONTEST LIKE THE COLD WAR NO POLITICIAN LIKE JOHN
trainval/ZB50BfYlsDc/50005 HARD PROBLEMS ARE HARD
trainval/ZB50BfYlsDc/50006 IT IS NOT 1961
trainval/ZBDablzQ9ts/50001 AND THEN MY LOGICAL BRAIN KICKED IN AND I NEEDED TO KNOW
trainval/ZBDablzQ9ts/50002 I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL INNOVATIONS THAT HUMAN BEINGS HAVE MADE
trainval/ZBDablzQ9ts/50003 AND AS A VIRTUE IT'S A SET OF STRENGTHS FOCUSED ON CARING FOR OTHERS
trainval/ZBDablzQ9ts/50004 IT WAS CALLED HUMANITY PLUS
trainval/ZBDablzQ9ts/50005 SOME NEUROSCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN USING TRANSCRANIAL STIMULATION WHICH IS PASSING
trainval/ZBDablzQ9ts/50006 CAN YOU IMAGINE IF WE DID THAT ABOUT TECHNOLOGY
trainval/ZBDablzQ9ts/50007 SO WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHETHER WE DISCOVERED HOW TO MAKE FIRE AND THEN WE COULD EAT
trainval/ZBDablzQ9ts/50008 THE TWO GROUPS THAT DID EXERCISE WHETHER THEY WANTED TO OR NOT GOT THE BENEFITS OF OXYGEN IN THEIR BRAIN
trainval/ZBDablzQ9ts/50009 IF YOU SPEAK ENGLISH SPANISH AND PORTUGUESE
trainval/ZBDablzQ9ts/50010 AND BRAIN SCANNING SHOWS THAT AT THE END OF THAT PERIOD OF LEARNING THE PART OF THE BRAIN THAT HAS TO DO WITH
trainval/ZBDablzQ9ts/50011 THEY'VE ALSO HAD A LONGSTANDING MOVEMENT AROUND GENDER NEUTRAL CLOTHING AND GENDER NEUTRAL TOYS FOR
trainval/ZBDablzQ9ts/50012 ONE GROUP KEPT IN A CONFINED SPACE ONE GROUP WERE FORCED TO RUN ON A TREADMILL FOR A CERTAIN
trainval/ZBg5QvcZQP8/50001 AS MEN AND WOMEN THERE ARE EXPECTATIONS FOR HOW WE WILL ACT IN SOCIETY IN ORDER FOR IT TO RUN
trainval/ZBg5QvcZQP8/50002 WE ARE TAUGHT THAT FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE
trainval/ZBg5QvcZQP8/50003 I CERTAINLY SIT LIKE THIS USUALLY WITH MY THIGHS OVER MY HANDS
trainval/ZBg5QvcZQP8/50004 IT IS LITERALLY A PHYSICALLY COMPACTING POSITION
trainval/ZBg5QvcZQP8/50005 AND THAT THEY MUST HAVE CONSEQUENCES
trainval/ZBg5QvcZQP8/50006 IN ORDER TO SEE THESE PHENOMENA COME OUT IN AN INTERVIEW TYPE SETTING DR
trainval/ZBg5QvcZQP8/50008 BUT THE MAN WAS CONSIDERED WEAK INCOMPETENT
trainval/ZBg5QvcZQP8/50009 I THINK THIS IS WHERE THE INTERVENTION NEEDS TO BEGIN
trainval/ZBg5QvcZQP8/50010 IF YOU ARE TOLD WHAT MATTERS IS YOUR APPEARANCE AND YOU ARE OFTEN NOT RECOGNISED FOR TRYING FOR TAKING A
trainval/ZBg5QvcZQP8/50011 THEY SAY LESS
trainval/ZBg5QvcZQP8/50012 THEY HESITATE MORE
trainval/ZBg5QvcZQP8/50013 WE KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT OK FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND FOR MANY OTHER REASONS
trainval/ZBg5QvcZQP8/50014 IF THERE ARE THREE THINGS I HOPE YOU TAKE AWAY FROM THIS IT IS ONE
trainval/ZBg5QvcZQP8/50015 THE REASON IT IS IMPORTANT TO CHANGE THEM IS BECAUSE WE ARE LIMITING OUR POOL OF INNOVATION BY NEARLY 50 AND WE HAVE
trainval/ZBg5QvcZQP8/50016 THERE ARE SO MANY WAYS THAT EACH OF YOU TODAY CAN BEGIN SOLVING THIS PROBLEM
trainval/ZBg5QvcZQP8/50017 NEXT TIME YOU SEE A PARENT OR A TEACHER OR ANYONE INTERACTING WITH A YOUNG STUDENT THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY
trainval/ZBg5QvcZQP8/50018 THINK ABOUT IT NEXT TIME YOU ARE ON A HIRING COMMITTEE
trainval/ZBg5QvcZQP8/50019 WHY YOU DID NOT LIKE THAT APPLICANT OR WHY YOU LOVED THAT APPLICANT
trainval/ZBg5QvcZQP8/50020 IS IT SOMETHING SPECIFIC ABOUT THEIR MERIT
trainval/ZBg5QvcZQP8/50021 THIS TIME THE RESULTS WERE REVERSED PEOPLE LIKED THE WOMAN MORE
trainval/zbHe4RpgV80/50001 YOU COULDN'T FIND ANYBODY THE MOMENT YOU MOVED AWAY FROM SAN JUAN
trainval/zbHe4RpgV80/50002 I TOLD THEM I WANT 18 KITCHENS AROUND THE ISLAND
trainval/zbHe4RpgV80/50003 WE BEGAN TRYING TO BE SENDING THE MESSAGE WE NEED TO START MOVING AWAY FROM THE PLACES THAT ARE ALREADY
trainval/zbHe4RpgV80/50004 RED CROSS DIDN'T HAVE THE RIGHT ANSWERS BECAUSE SOUTHERN BAPTIST CHURCH THE BIGGEST FOOD
trainval/zbHe4RpgV80/50005 WHEN YOU SEE THE RED CROSS DELIVERING FOOD IN AMERICA AFTER A HURRICANE IT'S SOUTHERN BAPTIST CHURCH DOING IT
trainval/zbHe4RpgV80/50006 AND SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY MAYBE YOU ARE MAKING THE PROBLEM BIGGER THAN IT WAS
trainval/zbHe4RpgV80/50008 SO IN THE PARTS OF THE ISLAND WHERE NOBODY IS USING THEM THOSE ARE THE PARTS OF THE ISLAND WHERE WE ARE GOING TO BE FOCUSING OUR
trainval/zbHe4RpgV80/50009 I BROUGHT 120 CHICKENS WITH YUCCA AND WITH RICE AND WE WENT BACK TO
trainval/zbHe4RpgV80/50010 WE ARRIVED WITH THE 120 CHICKENS WE DROPPED THE FOOD AND THE COMMUNITY WERE
trainval/zbHe4RpgV80/50011 I CANNOT LEAVE YOU ALONE FOR A DAY
trainval/zbHe4RpgV80/50012 SO I PICKED UP THE PHONE AND I CALLED A COMPANY CALLED BON APP TIT FEDELE
trainval/zbHe4RpgV80/50013 BON APP TIT'S ONE OF THE BIG CATERING COMPANIES
trainval/zbHe4RpgV80/50014 THEY BELONG TO A BIGGER GROUP CALLED COMPASS
trainval/zbHe4RpgV80/50015 AT ONE POINT WE GOT 16 OF THE BEST CHEFS THAT AMERICA CAN OFFER
trainval/zbHe4RpgV80/50016 THE MEN AND WOMEN ARE SMART THEY ARE PREPARED BUT THEY LIVE UNDER THIS AMAZING HIERARCHY
trainval/zbHe4RpgV80/50017 WE NEED TO BE EMPOWERING PEOPLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL
trainval/zbHe4RpgV80/50018 WHAT WE DID WAS A FLATTER ORGANIZATIONAL CHART WHERE EVERYBODY WAS OWNING THE SITUATION AND
trainval/ZBrbHy7l3tg/50001 AND BY THE WAY I DON'T MEAN TO BE BIASED AND SHOW JUST A MAN BECAUSE IN FACT WOMEN WERE
trainval/ZBrbHy7l3tg/50002 WHAT ARE WE DOING FOR OUR ENERGY
trainval/ZBrbHy7l3tg/50003 OF COURSE WE USE HYDROPOWER WE USE SOLAR POWER WE USE NUCLEAR POWER
trainval/ZBrbHy7l3tg/50004 WHAT WE LEARNED WITH THE 108 MILLION DOLLARS WAS A WAY TO MAKE AN ECONOMICALLY AND
trainval/ZBrbHy7l3tg/50005 AND WE GOT PRETTY FAR ALONG
trainval/ZBrbHy7l3tg/50006 AND THEN HAVE A WORKSHOP ABOUT IT BRING ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS INTO A ROOM BRING EVERYBODY THAT WOULD BE
trainval/ZBrbHy7l3tg/50007 WE HAVE A GOOD SOURCE PLACE FOR WATER WE HAVE PLENTY OF WASTEWATER WE CAN HELP YOU FIND A SOURCE OF CO2
trainval/ZBrbHy7l3tg/50008 WE KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF CONTINUING TO HUNT AND GATHER FOSSIL SOURCES OF ENERGY
trainval/zBSaSy6aKTY/50001 IF SHE UNDERSTANDS HER EMOTIONS AND SHE CAN BE PRESENT IN HER EMOTIONS SHE WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE HER WAY THROUGH
trainval/zBSaSy6aKTY/50002 AND WHEN DOING SO HE'S CREATING HIS LIFE
trainval/zBSaSy6aKTY/50003 I DON'T EXPECT ANY PART OF IT TO BE SKIPPED OVER
trainval/zBSaSy6aKTY/50004 I DON'T WANT THEM RETHINKING WHAT SMART MEANS DOWN THE ROAD
trainval/ZBuT2wdYtpM/50001 WELL THE PIG IS SAVED AND LATER THAT MORNING FERN DISCOVERS A CARTON ON HER CHAIR AT BREAKFAST
trainval/ZBuT2wdYtpM/50003 ARABLE SAVED FROM AN UNTIMELY DEATH
trainval/ZBuT2wdYtpM/50004 SHE WHISPERED OH
trainval/ZBuT2wdYtpM/50005 LOOK AT HIM
trainval/ZBuT2wdYtpM/50006 AS A TEACHER AND A MOM I CAN'T THINK OF MANY THINGS THAT MATTER AS MUCH AS READING ALOUD TO OUR KIDS
trainval/ZBuT2wdYtpM/50007 AT ALL AGES
trainval/ZBuT2wdYtpM/50008 AT SCHOOL AND AT HOME
trainval/ZBuT2wdYtpM/50009 SO WHEN I THINK BACK TO WHAT JOEY SAID TO ME ALL THOSE YEARS AGO MISS B
trainval/ZBuT2wdYtpM/50010 I FELT LIKE I WAS RIGHT THERE
trainval/ZBuT2wdYtpM/50011 THE DECODING OF WORDS TAKES UP SO MUCH BRAIN ENERGY THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF BRAIN SPACE LEFT OVER TO ACTUALLY
trainval/ZBuT2wdYtpM/50012 I COULD TRANSLATE OR DECODE THE WORDS BUT I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THEM OR THINK OR TALK ABOUT THEM
trainval/ZBuT2wdYtpM/50013 BECAUSE WHEN KIDS GO BACK TO THEIR OWN BOOKS THEY KNOW THAT WORLD SHOULD COME ALIVE IN THEIR BRAINS
trainval/ZcFRfJb2ONk/50001 WE ALSO KNOW THE CREATIVITY SCORES IN THIS COUNTRY ARE ON THE DECLINE THAT TORRANCE CREATIVITY
trainval/ZcFRfJb2ONk/50002 WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT
trainval/ZcFRfJb2ONk/50003 THAT DISCOMFORT AND THAT DISCOMFORT IS AMBIGUITY IT'S NOT KNOWING
trainval/ZcFRfJb2ONk/50004 I ACTUALLY LEARNED THIS FROM A GROUP OF TEACHERS
trainval/ZcFRfJb2ONk/50005 WE FIND THAT IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO ENGAGE OUR STUDENTS IN CREATIVE WORK IN PARTICULAR OPEN ENDED
trainval/ZcFRfJb2ONk/50006 IT JUST MAKES IT REALLY HARD
trainval/ZcFRfJb2ONk/50007 THEY PLAY IN A NUMBER OF WAYS
trainval/ZcFRfJb2ONk/50008 THEY EITHER PLAY WITH MATERIALS UNTIL IDEAS BEGIN TO MANIFEST OR THEY PLAY WITH IDEAS
trainval/ZcFRfJb2ONk/50009 IF ARTISTS ARE DOING THIS CAN'T YOU IMAGINE IF ART EDUCATION WAS A PLACE WHERE WE
trainval/ZChEFOGSn8Q/50001 WHEN OUR RELATIVES DIE WE CAN'T TAKE CARE OF THEM AS OUR TRADITION DEMANDS
trainval/ZChEFOGSn8Q/50002 TO HELP THESE COUNTRIES WHICH WERE IN SO MUCH TROUBLE AND CONCERN AT THAT TIME
trainval/ZChEFOGSn8Q/50003 BUT WHAT WE SAW WAS SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT
trainval/ZChEFOGSn8Q/50004 CAN WE EVER STOP EBOLA WHEN IT STARTS TO SPREAD LIKE THIS
trainval/ZChEFOGSn8Q/50005 SO WE DO KNOW HOW TO STOP EBOLA AND THESE STRATEGIES WORK LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
trainval/ZChEFOGSn8Q/50006 THE VIRUS WAS STOPPED IN NIGERIA BY THESE FOUR STRATEGIES AND THE PEOPLE IMPLEMENTING THEM OBVIOUSLY
trainval/zcMj4Az1MwE/50001 IN AMERICA OUR DEATH TRADITIONS HAVE COME TO BE CHEMICAL EMBALMING FOLLOWED
trainval/zcMj4Az1MwE/50002 ACCEPTING THE FACT THAT WE ARE ANIMALS HAS SOME POTENTIALLY TERRIFYING CONSEQUENCES
trainval/zcMj4Az1MwE/50003 FOR THE LAST NINE YEARS I'VE WORKED IN THE FUNERAL INDUSTRY FIRST AS A CREMATORY OPERATOR
trainval/zcMj4Az1MwE/50004 IT'S A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY AND ITS ECONOMIC MODEL IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF
trainval/zcMj4Az1MwE/50005 SO LET'S RETURN TO THE IDEA OF PROTECTION SANITATION AND BEAUTIFICATION
trainval/zcMj4Az1MwE/50006 WE'LL START WITH A DEAD BODY
trainval/zcMj4Az1MwE/50007 THE FUNERAL INDUSTRY WILL PROTECT YOUR DEAD BODY BY OFFERING TO SELL YOUR FAMILY A CASKET
trainval/zcMj4Az1MwE/50008 AT THE CEMETERY ON THE DAY OF BURIAL THAT CASKET WILL BE LOWERED INTO A LARGE CONCRETE OR METAL
trainval/zcMj4Az1MwE/50009 WE'RE WASTING ALL OF THESE RESOURCES CONCRETES METAL HARDWOODS HIDING THEM IN VAST
trainval/zcMj4Az1MwE/50010 THIS PROCEDURE DRAINS YOUR BLOOD AND REPLACES IT WITH A TOXIC CANCER CAUSING
trainval/zcMj4Az1MwE/50011 THEY'LL PUT IT IN MAKEUP
trainval/zcMj4Az1MwE/50012 THEY'LL PUT IT IN A SUIT
trainval/zcMj4Az1MwE/50013 I WAS AT WESTERN CAROLINA UNIVERSITY AT THEIR BODY FARM MORE ACCURATELY CALLED A
trainval/zcMj4Az1MwE/50014 ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY THERE WERE 12 BODIES LAID OUT IN VARIOUS STAGES OF DECOMPOSITION
trainval/zcMj4Az1MwE/50015 I WAS THERE BECAUSE A COLLEAGUE OF MINE NAMED KATRINA SPADE IS ATTEMPTING TO CREATE A SYSTEM NOT OF
trainval/zcMj4Az1MwE/50016 IN FACT IT'S LIKELY HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK
trainval/zcMj4Az1MwE/50017 NO REALLY I CAN'T
trainval/zcMj4Az1MwE/50018 THE GRAVES ARE SCATTERED ABOUT THE PROPERTY UNDER ELEGANT MOUNDS MARKED ONLY BY A ROCK OR A
trainval/zcMj4Az1MwE/50019 THE DEAD THEN BLEND SEAMLESSLY IN WITH THE LANDSCAPE
trainval/zcMj4Az1MwE/50020 THEY OFFER PUBLIC TRAILS PLACES FOR SPIRITUAL PRACTICE PLACES FOR
trainval/zcMj4Az1MwE/50021 I THINK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY'RE STARTING TO GET THE SENSE THAT OUR CURRENT FUNERAL INDUSTRY
trainval/zcMj4Az1MwE/50022 IN A TRADITIONAL CREMATION THE ASHES THAT ARE LEFT OVER INORGANIC BONE FRAGMENTS FORM A
trainval/zcMj4Az1MwE/50023 FOR MANY OF US BEING SANITIZED AND BEAUTIFIED JUST DOESN'T REFLECT US
trainval/zcMj4Az1MwE/50024 IT DOESN'T REFLECT WHAT WE STOOD FOR DURING OUR LIVES
trainval/zcMj4Az1MwE/50025 WILL CHANGING THE WAY WE BURY OUR DEAD SOLVE CLIMATE CHANGE
trainval/zcMj4Az1MwE/50026 BUT IT WILL MAKE BOLD MOVES IN HOW WE SEE OURSELVES AS CITIZENS OF THIS PLANET
trainval/zcMj4Az1MwE/50027 BUT IF YOU'RE RECOMPOSED IF YOU ACTUALLY BECOME THE SOIL YOU CAN NOURISH THE TREE AND BECOME THE POST
trainval/ZCRC5S0kfiw/50001 IT'S CALLED THE SUNGA
trainval/ZCS0MZuVBwE/50001 THEY WERE LOOKING BACK IN TIME 1
trainval/ZCS0MZuVBwE/50002 FROM THE FARTHEST SIDE MODERN HUMANS DON'T EXIST THE EARTH AS SEEN HAS NOT EVOLVED US
trainval/ZCS0MZuVBwE/50003 THEY LET US SEE THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF EXISTENCE LAID BARE BEFORE OUR EYES
trainval/ZCS0MZuVBwE/50004 ANOTHER IS A DESERT BECAUSE WATER VAPOR MOISTURE ABSORBS MICROWAVE LIGHT
trainval/ZCS0MZuVBwE/50005 MY DAILY COMMUTE A ONE KILOMETER TRUDGE THROUGH THE ICY BLACKNESS FROM STATION TO TELESCOPE
trainval/ZCS0MZuVBwE/50006 THE AIR AT THE SOUTH POLE DRIES EVERYTHING
trainval/ZCS0MZuVBwE/50007 IT DESICCATES YOUR SKIN TURNING IT PAPERY AND FRAGILE SO THAT IT TEARS WHEN YOU REACH IN A POCKET AND THEN
trainval/ZCS0MZuVBwE/50008 I WAS IN POLY SPEAK TOASTY
trainval/ZCS0MZuVBwE/50009 THE FIRST DIRECT RAYS SHOOK MY MIND
trainval/ZCS0MZuVBwE/50010 I MEAN WE'VE WATCHED IT HAPPEN
trainval/Zctk6MZaxMk/50001 TODAY WE DON'T EVEN GET A DAY OFF OF WORK IF WE GET AN INFECTION
trainval/Zctk6MZaxMk/50002 I'M KIND OF AN OPPOSITIONAL KIND A GUY I SEE PEOPLE RUNNING THIS WAY I'M GOING TO GO AND TAKE A LOOK
trainval/Zctk6MZaxMk/50003 AND I FIGURED
trainval/Zctk6MZaxMk/50004 IT MAKES THE LOGICAL SENSE TO GO AFTER CANCER ONE PERSON AT A TIME BECAUSE NO TWO CANCERS ARE THE SAME
trainval/Zctk6MZaxMk/50005 IT'S YOUR ROGUE CELLS NOT SOMEONE ELSE'S
trainval/Zctk6MZaxMk/50007 IT'S HARMLESS TO HUMANS
trainval/Zctk6MZaxMk/50008 IT'S KIND OF AN ANTIBIOTIC
trainval/Zctk6MZaxMk/50009 NOW IT'S NOT A CANCER FIGHTING VIRUS IN ANY WAY IT'S COMPLETELY HARMLESS BUT THIS IS A SOFTWARE COMPANY
trainval/Zctk6MZaxMk/50010 THAT'S SUPER COOL
trainval/Zctk6MZaxMk/50011 GIVE ME AN INHALER TOO
trainval/Zctk6MZaxMk/50012 IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER
trainval/Zctk6MZaxMk/50013 AND THAT DESIGN COULD BE FDA PROVED AND REGULATED
trainval/Zctk6MZaxMk/50014 THIS CHANGES THE BUSINESS MODEL OF BIOTECH
trainval/zCvSZBy6SyU/50001 AT THE END HE SAID I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DID THAT BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE GIVE UP HALFWAY
trainval/zCvSZBy6SyU/50002 I TOLD MY BRAIN I WANTED IT
trainval/zCvSZBy6SyU/50003 I KEPT SAYING I WANT IT
trainval/zCvSZBy6SyU/50004 I JUST WISH I COULD HAVE A WEEK OFF AT HOME LOUNGING AROUND
trainval/zCvSZBy6SyU/50006 SO THEY LINK PAIN TO PLEASURE
trainval/zCvSZBy6SyU/50007 I MUST HAVE MY ARM STRAIGHT
trainval/zCvSZBy6SyU/50008 I'VE CHOSEN TO HAVE A STRAIGHT ARM
trainval/zCvSZBy6SyU/50009 I CAN TAKE THE PAIN I WANT THE PAIN
trainval/zCvSZBy6SyU/50010 YOU SEE THE RIGHT THINGS YOU TELL YOURSELF THE RIGHT WORDS
trainval/zCvSZBy6SyU/50011 I TOLD MYSELF I WAS THE GREATEST BEFORE I EVEN WAS
trainval/zCvSZBy6SyU/50012 HE DIDN'T JUST GO YEAH I'M THE GREATEST ME
trainval/zCvSZBy6SyU/50013 HE TRAINED HE WORKED OUT HE WAS DISCIPLINED
trainval/zCvSZBy6SyU/50015 SO I SAID YES OF COURSE I COULD DO THAT
trainval/zcwySEjaQlc/50001 AND WE BELIEVE IT CAN BE DONE AND I'M HERE TO INVITE YOU IN ON THIS
trainval/zcwySEjaQlc/50002 INFORMATION IS UP ON THE SCREEN
trainval/zcwySEjaQlc/50003 HOWEVER WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT INTRODUCING MORE HOMELESS SERVICES WILL LEAD US TO ENDING
trainval/zcwySEjaQlc/50004 THERE ARE CERTAIN ORGANIZATIONS IN DES MOINES THAT ARE DOING AN INCREDIBLE JOB MEETING THOSE NEEDS AND FOR US WE FEEL THE BEST
trainval/zcwySEjaQlc/50005 THIS IS ALL STARTED WITH A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE IOWA CUBS WHERE ON ROAD TRIPS THEY WOULD GATHER THEIR
trainval/zcwySEjaQlc/50006 WE'VE SINCE GROWN THAT INITIATIVE AND WE'VE INCLUDED A HOTEL MANAGEMENT GROUP THAT HAS THREE HOTELS IN THE GREATER
trainval/ZdDjexbxVzM/50001 BUT IT'S NOT EXACTLY 2
trainval/ZdDjexbxVzM/50002 IT'S ONLY 2
trainval/ZdDjexbxVzM/50003 THOSE GRAVITATIONAL WAVES IN THE STRUCTURE OF SPACE ARE TOTALLY INVISIBLE FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES
trainval/ZdDjexbxVzM/50004 THE THING THAT'S TOTALLY AMAZING THE REASON I'M ON THIS STAGE IS BECAUSE WHAT THAT TELLS US IS SOMETHING DEEP ABOUT THE
trainval/ZdDjexbxVzM/50005 FOR GOOD REASONS WE THOUGHT WE'D NEVER SEE KILLER EVIDENCE AND THIS IS KILLER EVIDENCE
trainval/zdSdqUuvLk4/50001 OUR CREATIVITY COMES FROM WITHOUT NOT FROM WITHIN
trainval/zdSdqUuvLk4/50002 WE ARE NOT SELF MADE
trainval/zdSdqUuvLk4/50003 WE ARE DEPENDENT ON ONE ANOTHER AND ADMITTING THIS TO OURSELVES ISN'T AN EMBRACE OF
trainval/ZdvUktSa1I4/50001 IF KIDS DON'T KNOW THEY WILL CHOOSE A SNACK SHACK AND PANIC OVER
trainval/ZdvUktSa1I4/50002 NOW THAT I'M OLDER AND MORE MATURE I WANT TO BE A POWERFUL VOICE IN FOOD ADVOCACY FOR MY
trainval/zESeeaFDVSw/50001 WE REMEMBER THINGS BETTER WHEN THEY'RE ATTACHED TO A PICTURE
trainval/zESeeaFDVSw/50002 YOU JUST HAVE TO ASK IT TO PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER FOR YOU
trainval/zeSVMG4GkeQ/50001 YOU QUIT YOUR JOB ARE YOU CRAZY
trainval/zeSVMG4GkeQ/50002 WHO QUITS THEIR JOB IN THIS ECONOMY
trainval/zeSVMG4GkeQ/50003 EVEN THOUGH I ASSURED MY DAD THAT IT WAS JUST A LEAVE OF ABSENCE HE WAS UNABLE TO COMPREHEND WHAT WAS FOR HIM THE SHEER
trainval/Zf0zAiS8CtY/50001 SO WE WANTED TO STUDY IT
trainval/Zf0zAiS8CtY/50002 WE WANTED TO UNDERSTAND BETTER SO WE LAUNCHED A WISH IMPACT STUDY
trainval/Zf0zAiS8CtY/50003 THERE ARE 91 WISH RECIPIENTS AS PART OF THIS STUDY
trainval/ZFpbkCSHimY/50001 IT'S IN YOUR SOUP
trainval/ZFpbkCSHimY/50002 PRIMARY SUGAR IN IT
trainval/zG21nyJNBSA/50001 I RESOLVED TO GIVE BACK
trainval/zG21nyJNBSA/50002 FIRST TRANSFER OF RESOURCES FROM RICH COUNTRIES IN THE NORTH TO POORER COUNTRIES IN THE
trainval/zGEDHMF4rLI/50001 THERE MAY POSSIBLY BE A THIRD ALTERNATIVE
trainval/zGEDHMF4rLI/50002 I CAN SEE IT
trainval/zGEDHMF4rLI/50003 AND HE IS WORTHY OF AN ENTIRE TALK ON HIS OWN RIGHT
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50001 A WAY TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50002 I THINK THERE ARE TONS OF THINGS THAT BUSINESS AND THE MARKET DOES REALLY REALLY WELL
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50003 SO THE QUESTION IS MORE
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50004 WHERE HAVE WE GONE WRONG
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50006 I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT THAT'S ABSOLUTE RUBBISH
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50007 NOW FOR A COUNTRY LIKE GREECE THERE'S A KERNEL OF TRUTH IN THAT BUT FOR THE OTHER COUNTRIES NO
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50008 THEY HAD A RECESSION SO MORE PEOPLE FELL INTO UNEMPLOYMENT AND NEEDED UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50009 SIMILARLY THE RECESSION CAUSED A COLLAPSE IN TAX REVENUES
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50010 BE UNDER NO MISTAKE THE EUROZONE CRISIS AND THE 2008
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50011 WELL NO IT'S NOT
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50013 AND THEIR RESPONSE TO THIS IS TO SAY OH BUT THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER INITIATIVES THAT ARE COMING IN AND THAT'S GOING TO MOP
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50014 NOW I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME SO I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO THROUGH ALL THOSE DIFFERENT INITIATIVES THAT ARE COMING
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50015 AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT RBS AND LLOYDS THAT HAD DIRECT MONEY INJECTED INTO THEM BY THE
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50016 SO THE FACT THAT THEY CAN GO OUT AND BORROW IN THE MARKETS AT LOWER RATES OF INTEREST THAN THEY COULD DO IF THE MARKET
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50017 AND THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT I'M JUST MAKING UP
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50018 THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAVE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH INTO THIS AND THINK THIS IS WORTH BILLIONS OF POUNDS PER YEAR TO BANKS LIKE
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50019 AND IF WE'RE GOING TO START GETTING PEOPLE TO BELIEVE IN CAPITALISM AGAIN
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50020 AND WE NEED TO START RECOGNIZING ITS LIMITATIONS AND NOT JUST RELIGIOUSLY APPLYING
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50021 SO I NOW WORK ON FINANCIAL REFORM IN A THINK TANK BUT I USED TO WORK ON THE TRADING FLOOR OF
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50022 SO I DON'T SUBSCRIBE TO THE VIEW THAT'S PUT FORWARD IN A LOT OF NEWSPAPERS THAT JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50023 AND OBVIOUSLY THIS IS AN EVENT THAT'S BEEN ORGANIZED BY THE LONDON BUSINESS SCHOOL SO I IMAGINE LOTS OF PEOPLE IN
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50024 AND THE PROBLEM WITH THAT SYSTEM IS THAT THAT MEANS THAT ALL THESE BUSINESSES AND THOSE MANAGERS ARE
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50025 NOW I'M NOT SUGGESTING FOR A SECOND THAT WE SHOULD GET RID OF STOCK MARKETS COMPLETELY I DON'T THINK THAT AT ALL
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50026 I THINK ONCE AGAIN THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS THAT STOCK MARKETS ARE GOOD AT
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50027 AND AT THE MOMENT I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD AGREE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE SEVERELY OVERPAID IN
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50028 THERE ISN'T THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE TO BACK UP THIS CLAIM
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50029 NOW A LOT OF YOU ARE PROBABLY THINKING
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50030 WELL YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE THE CAYMAN ISLANDS IS A SOVEREIGN STATE IT'S ENTITLED TO SET ITS TAX RATES
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50031 AND SIMILARLY IF A BUSINESS WANTS TO LOCATE IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS IT SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO THAT
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50032 NOW I WOULD 100 AGREE WITH BOTH OF THOSE THINGS
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50033 SO I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF THE SORT OF THING MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES DO
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50034 NOW WHAT THAT MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION CAN DO IS IT CAN SET UP A SUBSIDIARY COMPANY
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50035 BECAUSE WE'RE TURNING AROUND TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD AN ARMY OF ACCOUNTANTS AND LAWYERS
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50036 THERE WAS JUST THIS BLIND FAITH THIS AUTOMATIC ASSUMPTION THAT THIS ABSOLUTELY MUST BE A GREAT WAY
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50037 AND IT'S THAT SORT OF MENTALITY THAT WE REALLY HAVE TO MOVE AWAY FROM BECAUSE A BELIEF IN THE
trainval/ZhDgwrKSBWQ/50038 I MEAN THEY'RE BOTH EXTREME LIKE I SAY ALMOST RELIGIOUS VALUES TO HOLD AND CLEARLY YOU KNOW SOME ARE
trainval/ZHOyfyGwpes/50001 RATHER WHEN SMART AUTOS EXCHANGE ELECTRICITY AND INFORMATION THROUGH SMART BUILDINGS WITH SMART GRIDS THEY'RE
trainval/ZHOyfyGwpes/50002 SO THE ELECTRIFIED AUTOS MAKE THE AUTO AND ELECTRICITY PROBLEMS EASIER TO SOLVE TOGETHER THAN
trainval/ZHOyfyGwpes/50003 NOW IF YOU LIKE ANY OF THOSE OUTCOMES YOU CAN SUPPORT REINVENTING FIRE WITHOUT NEEDING TO LIKE
trainval/ziGD7vQOwl8/50001 THEY'RE A SEAFARING PEOPLE
trainval/ziGD7vQOwl8/50002 THERE'S NO WAY THEY THINK THEY CAN TAKE HIM
trainval/ziGD7vQOwl8/50003 YOU CAN'T GO AS YOU ARE
trainval/ziGD7vQOwl8/50004 HE SAYS I CAN'T WEAR THIS STUFF
trainval/ziGD7vQOwl8/50005 YOU'VE GOT TO BE CRAZY
trainval/ziGD7vQOwl8/50007 IT'S NOT THIS RIGHT
trainval/ziGD7vQOwl8/50008 45 CALIBER HANDGUN
trainval/ziGD7vQOwl8/50009 DAVID ONLY HAS ONE STICK
trainval/ziGD7vQOwl8/50010 AND THROUGHOUT HISTORY MANY OF THE MOST FAMOUS GIANTS HAVE ALL HAD ACROMEGALY
trainval/ziGD7vQOwl8/50011 AND ACROMEGALY HAS A VERY DISTINCT SET OF SIDE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH IT PRINCIPALLY HAVING
trainval/ziGD7vQOwl8/50012 ACCURACY WE KNOW FROM HISTORICAL RECORDS THAT SLINGERS
trainval/ziGD7vQOwl8/50013 BECAUSE HE CAN'T SEE HIM
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50001 BUT NO HIV AFFECTS PEOPLE WE KNOW
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50002 AND THAT'S WHY WE MIGHT BE USED TO SAYING THINGS LIKE THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HIV AS IF SOMEHOW
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50003 AND I DON'T BELIEVE IN THIS OTHERING
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50004 BUT NO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US CONTRIBUTES TO THIS OVERALL STORY AND HOW WE TALK ABOUT HIV AND HOW WE REACT
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50005 ONCE AGAIN THE LANGUAGE DEFINES HOW WE THINK ABOUT HIV
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50006 AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50007 I'VE BEEN DOING OUTREACH AT UBC FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS NOW AND I GET ASKED SOME COMMON QUESTIONS HERE BY UBC
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50008 OH I'M NOT PROMISCUOUS I DON'T NEED TO USE A CONDOM
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50009 IN BC WITH A POPULATION OF 4
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50010 I DON'T NEED TO GET TESTED
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50011 EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OK
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50012 IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY THEM AND TO MOVE PAST THEM BECAUSE NO YOU CANNOT GET HIV FROM A TOILET SEAT
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50013 AND NO HIV IS ABSOLUTELY NOT JUST A GAY PROBLEM
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50014 ALL THESE THOUGHTS MUST BE RACING THROUGH YOUR HEAD
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50015 CAN I TELL MY PARENTS
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50017 AM I GOING TO DIE
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50018 I HAVE A FRIEND
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50020 AND STEVE IS HIV POSITIVE
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50021 AND STEVE SAID
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50022 I WAS TERRIFIED
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50023 AT THAT ONE MOMENT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50025 I WILL NOT GET HIV
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50026 4 MILLION PEOPLE ARE HIV POSITIVE
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50027 IT COULD MEAN THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO FIND OUT
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50028 IT COULD MEAN THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HIV AND HOW IT AFFECTS US
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50029 IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50030 BECAUSE WE SHOULD BREAK PAST THIS STIGMA BEHIND TESTING AND WE SHOULD JUST GO AND DO IT
trainval/ZIhFcjcc568/50031 BUT I'M GOING TO ARGUE THAT WHILE HIV IS LIFE CHANGING IT IS NOT LIFE DEFINING
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50001 ALMOST ALL OF LARGE COMPANIES AND THE MAJORITY OF SMALL BUSINESSES ARE NOW OFFERING WEB SERVICES TO THEIR
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50002 BUT STILL THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE KIND OF BREACHES THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT AT ALL
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50003 SO DOING THESE INTERACTIONS WE ARE SHARING A LOT OF DATA ABOUT OURSELVES
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50004 LET ME ILLUSTRATE THIS PROBLEM OF THIS WELL MOTIVATED WELL CAPABLE ATTACKER BY USING A QUOTE FROM
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50005 WE ARE GOING TO BE PERSISTENT WE ARE GOING TO KEEP COMING AND COMING AND COMING
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50006 OR HAVE THEY BEEN VERY INADEQUATELY PREPARED
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50007 OFTENTIMES IT'S QUITE SENSITIVE DATA
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50008 SO WHAT WE NEED GIVEN JUST THIS SUB SELECTION OF REASONS IS REALLY A MULTIFACETED APPROACH TO ADDRESS
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50009 AND ONE THING THAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON IS A POTENTIALLY POWERFUL ROLE OF EXTERNAL SECURITY RESEARCHERS
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50010 AND IF THIS PROCESS REPEATS OVER AND OVER AGAIN THEN WE ARE HOPING THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50011 ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE WOOYUN WHERE ANY HACKER CAN SUBMIT ANY KIND OF VULNERABILITY ABOUT ANY
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50012 THE PROGRAM OR PARTICIPATION MODEL OF WOOYUN IS MUCH BROADER IN THIS SENSE
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50014 SO THE QUESTION ARISES
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50015 SO WHAT I WANT TO DO IN THE FOLLOWING IS TO DELVE A LITTLE BIT DEEPER INTO THE DATA TO GIVE YOU SOME ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50016 SO THAT'S GOOD
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50017 AT THE SAME TIME WE ALSO SEE ON HACKERONE AND MOSTLY ON WOOYUN A LOT OF PROGRAMS THAT DO NOT
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50018 HOW WELL ARE THESE COMPANIES ACTUALLY SAFEGUARDING OUR INFORMATION
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50019 AND WE STILL SEE THERE THAT WHITE HAT RESEARCHERS DO A LOT OF WORK AND SUBMITTING A LARGE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50021 ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WE FIND INTERESTING IS TO EXPLORE THE DIFFERENT BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS OF THESE WHITE HAT RESEARCHERS
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50022 AT THE SAME TIME I'M ALSO TRYING TO ASSESS A POTENTIALLY POWERFUL PATHWAY TO IMPROVE THAT
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50023 BUT FIRST THE BAD NEWS
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50024 FINALLY THE QUESTION ARISES
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50025 SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50026 GIVEN THESE DIFFERENT PARTICIPATION PATTERNS OUR EXPLANATION IS THAT INDEED THE ORGANIZATIONS ARE BETTER PREPARED
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50027 AFTER ALL THEY ASKED FOR THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE WHITE HAT RESEARCHERS
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50028 ON THE OTHER HAND ON WOOYUN WE SEE THE OPPOSITE
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50029 WE SEE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF COMPANIES ARE COERCED TO PARTICIPATE THROUGH THE SUBMISSIONS OF WHITE HAT RESEARCHERS
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50031 AT THE SAME TIME IT IS NECESSARY TO THEN ALSO PREEMPT THE ACTIVITIES OF BLACK HATS
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50032 WHAT WE ARE ALSO DOING IS TO WORK ON MAKING THE INFORMATION THAT WE ARE COLLECTING PRESENTABLE AND
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50033 LAST YEAR FACEBOOK RELEASED A NEW WEB MESSENGER APP THAT ACTUALLY INCLUDED AN IMPLEMENTATION MISTAKE
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50034 AND WITHIN MINUTES OF RELEASING THIS PARTICULAR APPLICATION 15 DIFFERENT WHITE HATS HAD ALREADY
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50035 SO REDISCOVERY CAN BE HAPPENING VERY QUICKLY AND IT CAN BE A VERY POWERFUL MEAN
trainval/zISxg4JhSRk/50036 FOR THIS KIND OF PURPOSE THIS DATA CAN BE VERY VALUABLE
trainval/ZIVSJYazE9s/50001 IT'S A BIG CHALLENGE AND WHAT IS OUR RESPONSE TO IT
trainval/ZIVSJYazE9s/50003 I KNOW IT'S POSSIBLE
trainval/ZIVSJYazE9s/50004 WE ARE GOING TO DO IT
trainval/zIwLWfaAgS8/50001 IT TAKES AWAY SO MUCH OF YOUR LIFE
trainval/zIwLWfaAgS8/50002 SO THAT'S ROUGHLY A HALF ORDER OF MAGNITUDE IMPROVEMENT RIGHT THERE
trainval/zIwLWfaAgS8/50004 IS THERE A TIE IN HERE WITH HYPERLOOP
trainval/zIwLWfaAgS8/50005 COULD YOU APPLY THESE TUNNELS TO USE FOR THIS HYPERLOOP IDEA YOU RELEASED A FEW YEARS AGO
trainval/zIwLWfaAgS8/50007 SOME ARE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT TRANSITIONING ENTIRELY TO ELECTRIC AND SOME ARE JUST DABBLING IN IT
trainval/zIwLWfaAgS8/50008 SO THIS WILL BE A VERY SPRY TRUCK
trainval/zIwLWfaAgS8/50009 YOU CAN DRIVE THIS AROUND LIKE A SPORTS CAR
trainval/zIwLWfaAgS8/50010 THAT'S A REAL FAKE HOUSE
trainval/zIwLWfaAgS8/50011 WE THINK PROBABLY MORE BUT YEAH
trainval/zIwLWfaAgS8/50012 EM WELL WHEN IT'S RUNNING AT FULL SPEED YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY SEE THE CELLS WITHOUT A STROBE LIGHT
trainval/zIwLWfaAgS8/50013 HOW MANY GIGAFACTORIES IF YOU LIKE DOES IT TAKE TO GET US THERE
trainval/zIwLWfaAgS8/50014 ASPIRATIONALLY THAT'S OUR TARGET
trainval/zIwLWfaAgS8/50015 LIKE WHY DO YOU WANT TO LIVE
trainval/zIwLWfaAgS8/50018 WHAT DO YOU LOVE ABOUT THE FUTURE
trainval/zIwLWfaAgS8/50019 BUT WHY NOT JUST DO THAT
trainval/zIwLWfaAgS8/50020 SUSTAINABLE ENERGY WILL HAPPEN NO MATTER WHAT
trainval/zIwLWfaAgS8/50021 SOLAR ENERGY WE NEED TO GET THERE SO WE NEED TO MAKE THESE BEAUTIFUL ROOFS
trainval/zIXX3HPgEnI/50001 THEY BRING IN ABOUT A DOZEN PEOPLE TO PLAY
trainval/zIXX3HPgEnI/50002 ALL I WAS EXPECTED TO DO WAS FOLLOW THE RULES AND PLAY TO WIN
trainval/zIXX3HPgEnI/50004 IT'S SOMETHING THAT MADE ME THINK OH I SHOULD GET A MASTER'S DEGREE IN ENGINEERING EVEN THOUGH I HAD BEEN AN ART
trainval/zIXX3HPgEnI/50006 THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF HOW I THINK ABOUT MYSELF
trainval/zIXX3HPgEnI/50007 THAT'S WHAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT ABOUT MY PART IN THE CONVERSATION
trainval/zIXX3HPgEnI/50008 IN A WINNING ON A GAME SHOW ISN'T A HUGE DEAL IN THE GRANT SCHEME OF THINGS BUT
trainval/zIXX3HPgEnI/50009 I HOPE THAT ONE DAY PEOPLE WILL SEE ME MORE THE WAY I SEE MYSELF THAT I DIDN'T ACHIEVE THIS AS A
trainval/ZJodZcGfTVE/50001 IN MANY OPPRESSIVE STATES THE MEDIA IS JUST A TOOL FOR GOVERNMENT PROPAGANDA
trainval/ZJPdJuhI03U/50001 AND MY COLLEAGUES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT IF YOU JUST PUT TWO OR THREE POSITIONS WHERE MOSQUITOES CAN GO PICK UP THESE LETHAL
trainval/ZJPdJuhI03U/50002 THAT'S 2555 INFECTIOUS BITES EVERY YEAR
trainval/ZJPdJuhI03U/50003 BUT THAT'S OK
trainval/ZJPdJuhI03U/50004 WHO HAS SET A GOAL OF 2030 TO ELIMINATE MALARIA FROM 35 COUNTRIES
trainval/ZJPdJuhI03U/50006 SO THERE'S REALLY NO PROBLEM IF WE HAD A NEW TOOL
trainval/zjvsA0v7r0g/50002 FOR US TO KNOW WHAT THE HUMAN BODY IS CAPABLE OF TO KNOW WHAT THE MIND IS CAPABLE OF
trainval/zjvsA0v7r0g/50004 WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO LET THEM EXPLORE THEIR ENVIRONMENT
trainval/zjvsA0v7r0g/50005 NOW LITTLE JOHNNY IS BEING LIKE OH MUM PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
trainval/zjvsA0v7r0g/50007 WHAT HAPPENS THEN
trainval/zjvsA0v7r0g/50008 BUT WHAT IF WE COULD START LOOKING AT OBSTACLES IN A DIFFERENT WAY WHAT IF WE COULD START SEEING THEM THAN INSTEAD OF THINGS THAT ARE STOPPING US
trainval/zjvsA0v7r0g/50009 HE CAME DOWN AND HE SHOWED ME
trainval/zjvsA0v7r0g/50010 HE CLIMBED THE WHOLE OBSTACLE CAME BACK DOWN
trainval/zjvsA0v7r0g/50011 I WAS LIKE ALL RIGHT
trainval/zjvsA0v7r0g/50012 WE WENT UP TOGETHER WE STARTED CLIMBING
trainval/zjvsA0v7r0g/50013 YOU GET UP TO THAT FIRST OBSTACLE PUT YOUR HANDS ON THE STEEL RAILS LIKE AMP QUOT ALL RIGHT
trainval/zjvsA0v7r0g/50016 YOU HAVE TO STOP
trainval/zjvsA0v7r0g/50017 I SAID I AM GOING TO LOOK AT THIS OBSTACLE AS AN OPPORTUNITY
trainval/zjvsA0v7r0g/50018 I LOVED IT TOO MUCH
trainval/zjvsA0v7r0g/50019 FOR ME IT WAS LIKE THE LOVE FOR IT I'LL WAIT ANYTHING ELSE IN LIFE
trainval/zjvsA0v7r0g/50020 SO I WAS LIKE OH MUM JUST GOING TO THE LIBRARY TODAY
trainval/zjvsA0v7r0g/50021 BUT IF WE THINK WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT THEN WE MAKE IT
trainval/zjvsA0v7r0g/50022 SO THE MIND HAS SO MUCH POWER OVER WHAT WE DO IN LIFE
trainval/ZJXxySanins/50001 ONE OF MY FIRST CREATIVE WRITING TEACHERS TOLD ME THAT WHAT I WAS WRITING WASN'T POETRY AND TO CHANGE IT
trainval/ZK3S2rCHmPA/50001 BUT THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF AQUAPONICS PROGRAMS IN PRISON WE ARE STARTING TO SEE SOME OF THESE CYCLES
trainval/zK8mdS7LJQQ/50001 AND WROTE IN SOME STORIES ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON IN OUR HOUSE AND IN THE WORLD AROUND ME
trainval/zK8mdS7LJQQ/50002 UNCOVER HOW THEY MAY HAVE GROWN FROM TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES
trainval/zkQL7UJYDIY/50003 THAT'S WHY I AM ALWAYS JEALOUS WITH THE SAINTS IN INDIA
trainval/zkQL7UJYDIY/50004 BUT I AM ALSO TRYING TO MAKE SANITARY PAD WITH THE GOOD COTTON
trainval/zkQL7UJYDIY/50005 IT'S NOT WORKING
trainval/zkQL7UJYDIY/50006 I USED MEDICAL COLLEGE GIRLS
trainval/zkQL7UJYDIY/50009 RURAL EMPLOYMENT THAT I'M GOING TO CREATE
trainval/zkQL7UJYDIY/50011 I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THIS AS A CORPORATE ENTITY
trainval/ZLgGoHXp8s4/50001 WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS IF YOU MADE A MIX TAPE OR PUT SOMETHING ON ITUNES I WOULD TOTALLY BUY
trainval/ZLgGoHXp8s4/50002 LET ME KNOW WHEN YOUR ALBUM DROPS
trainval/ZLgGoHXp8s4/50003 WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG MY MOM BOUGHT A BANJO
trainval/ZliT1BiEVvo/50001 IT'S NOT EASY IT'S NOT LIKE A NORMAL WHITE BREAD WHERE YOU JUST CAN THROW EVERYTHING TOGETHER
trainval/ZliT1BiEVvo/50002 YOU DON'T WANT TO DRINK A RIESLING WITH EVERYTHING RIGHT
trainval/ZLiUelSu7s8/50001 AND IT TURNED OUT THEY BOTH HAD IT
trainval/ZLiUelSu7s8/50002 FORMER PHILADELPHIA EAGLES STRONG SAFETY 44 YEARS OLD A DIVISION II FOOTBALL COACH WHEN HE DECIDED TO PUT A
trainval/ZLiUelSu7s8/50003 IN THE ARTICLE THEY REMINDED ME HIS NICKNAME WAS DIRTY WATERS
trainval/ZLiUelSu7s8/50004 HE WAS KNOWN FOR LEADING WITH HIS HEAD SO I THOUGHT I'M JUST GOING TO LOOK UP DID HE EVER TALK ABOUT THE CONCUSSIONS HE HAD
trainval/ZLiUelSu7s8/50005 BUT IF YOU DO GET THE PERMISSION OF HIS NEXT OF KIN I WILL RELEASE THE BRAIN TO YOU
trainval/ZLiUelSu7s8/50006 AND THEN I REALIZED I HAD TO FIGURE OUT WHO HIS NEXT OF KIN WAS AND ASK THEM AND IT TURNED OUT IT WAS ANDRE WATERS'S 88 YEAR OLD
trainval/ZLiUelSu7s8/50007 WE WANT TO KNOW WHY HE CHANGED SO MUCH IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS OF HIS LIFE
trainval/ZLiUelSu7s8/50008 AND SO WHAT I STARTED WAS A BRAIN DONATION REGISTRY
trainval/ZLiUelSu7s8/50009 WE'VE ALSO BEEN LUCKY TO HAVE PEOPLE LIKE BRANDI CHASTAIN THE WOMEN'S SOCCER ICON NASCAR'S DALE EARNHARDT JR
trainval/ZlKrvnB8YnU/50001 WE HAD NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS ISM SO ONCE WE LEARNED ABOUT ABLEISM WE REALIZED THAT WERE A LOT OF THINGS WHICH WE DO
trainval/ZlKrvnB8YnU/50002 IT WAS DURING THIS TOPIC THAT I REALIZED THAT I NEED TO STOP WORRYING ABOUT HOW I'M AFFECTED AND START TAKING INTO ACCOUNT
trainval/ZlKrvnB8YnU/50003 IN ORDER TO EMPATHETIC YOU UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN THROUGH BUT WHEN YOU ARE SYMPATHETIC YOU TRY TO MAKE THAT
trainval/zLNXIXingyU/50001 IT'S CERTAINLY QUITE A STRONG STATEMENT THAT THE NSA IS WILLING TO REACH OUT AND SHOW A MORE OPEN
trainval/zLNXIXingyU/50002 WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF IT
trainval/zLNXIXingyU/50005 AND I THINK THIS IS PARTLY WHERE THERE IS SUCH A DIVIDE OF OPINION THAT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM AND AROUND THE WORLD WHO
trainval/zLNXIXingyU/50006 IT'S THE BRINGER OF KNOWLEDGE TO ALL
trainval/zLNXIXingyU/50007 OTHERWISE IF WE COULD MAKE IT SO THAT ALL THE BAD GUYS USED ONE CORNER OF THE INTERNET WE COULD HAVE A DOMAIN BADGUY
trainval/zLNXIXingyU/50008 IS THERE SUCH A RIGHT
trainval/zLNXIXingyU/50009 THAT WOULD BE AWESOME AND WE COULD JUST CONCENTRATE ALL OUR EFFORTS THERE
trainval/zLNXIXingyU/50010 SO I THINK ABSOLUTELY FOLKS DO HAVE A RIGHT TO PRIVACY AND THAT WE WORK VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE
trainval/zLNXIXingyU/50011 THE ALTERNATIVE TO THAT IS ONE THAT'S MUCH LESS EFFICIENT AND MUCH MORE INVASIVE OF PRIVACY WHICH IS GIGANTIC AMOUNTS
trainval/zLNXIXingyU/50012 YOU HAD A FOLLOW ON A WEEK LATER TO A QATARI COMPANY
trainval/zLNXIXingyU/50013 IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE ACTUAL WORDS THAT SOMEONE HAS WRITTEN IN AN EMAIL OR GIVEN ON A PHONE CALL
trainval/zLNXIXingyU/50014 IT'S WHO THEY WROTE TO AND WHEN AND SO FORTH
trainval/zLNXIXingyU/50015 BUT IT'S BEEN ARGUED AND SOMEONE HERE IN THE AUDIENCE HAS TALKED TO A FORMER NSA ANALYST WHO
trainval/zLNXIXingyU/50016 IS THERE ANYTHING TO THAT
trainval/zLNXIXingyU/50017 HE DIDN'T COME OVER LIKE A CRAZY MAN
trainval/zLNXIXingyU/50018 DO YOU STILL THINK THAT
trainval/zLNXIXingyU/50019 THE GOVERNMENT YOU OTHERS IN TERMS OF PUTTING THINGS RIGHT AND HELPING FIGURE OUT A SMARTER POLICY A SMARTER
trainval/zLNXIXingyU/50020 I OFFERED HIM THE CHANCE TO SHARE AN IDEA WORTH SPREADING
trainval/zMAU8SY8pMs/50001 WE ARE ABLE TO DO THIS NO MATTER WHAT OUR CULTURAL BACKGROUND IS
trainval/zMAU8SY8pMs/50002 SPOKEN LANGUAGES THOUGH CAN CREATE BARRIERS BETWEEN CULTURES
trainval/zMAU8SY8pMs/50003 THEY OFTEN PREVENT YOU FROM LEARNING ABOUT AND RELATING TO ALL THE FASCINATING THINGS
trainval/zMAU8SY8pMs/50004 WE DON'T FLY OR SWIM BETTER
trainval/zMAU8SY8pMs/50005 WE DON'T CLIMB HIGHER
trainval/zMAU8SY8pMs/50006 FIND YOUR OWN CONCRETE WAYS TO CARRY ACROSS OUR MANY CULTURES
trainval/zMAU8SY8pMs/50007 IT'S A COMMON GROUND UPON WHICH WE CAN PLANT COMPLEX YET BALANCED CONVERSATIONS
trainval/zmDENxTPn8Q/50001 AND THIS ISN'T JUST FOUND IN PACKAGING
trainval/zmDENxTPn8Q/50002 THEY'RE NOT BIOLOGICALLY COMPATIBLE
trainval/zmDENxTPn8Q/50003 SECOND OF ALL WE SHOULD REALLY STRIVE TO USE FAR LESS ENERGY IN CREATING THESE MATERIALS
trainval/zmDENxTPn8Q/50004 THIS IS CRAZY
trainval/zmDENxTPn8Q/50005 IT JUST DROPS THEM THE SHORTEST DISTANCE POSSIBLE TO THE FOREST FLOOR WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY
trainval/zmDENxTPn8Q/50006 IN THIS CASE WE'VE GROWN A CORNER BLOCK
trainval/zmDENxTPn8Q/50007 THEY CAN ACTUALLY PUT THIS IN THEIR NATURAL ECOSYSTEM WITHOUT ANY PROCESSING AND IT'S GOING TO IMPROVE THE LOCAL SOIL
trainval/zmDENxTPn8Q/50008 YOU DON'T NEED A LOT OF EQUIPMENT TO SET UP A PRODUCTION FACILITY
trainval/ZmSF9gVz9pg/50001 WE INGEST NUTRIENTS
trainval/ZmSF9gVz9pg/50002 AND SHE WAS HORRIFIED TO GET THERE AND FIND THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE A TOILET
trainval/ZmSF9gVz9pg/50003 SHE'D GROWN UP WITH A LATRINE
trainval/ZmSF9gVz9pg/50004 IT WAS NO BIG DEAL BUT IT WAS A LATRINE
trainval/ZmSF9gVz9pg/50005 SHE WAS SCARED OF DRUNKS HANGING AROUND
trainval/ZmSF9gVz9pg/50007 IT'S WHAT I CALL SOCIAL CONTAGION AND IT'S REALLY POWERFUL AND REALLY EXCITING
trainval/ZmSF9gVz9pg/50008 THEY'VE MADE IT CONVERSATIONAL
trainval/ZmSF9gVz9pg/50010 DIFF AND IT'S RESISTANT TO ANTIBIOTICS IN MANY CASES
trainval/zMWYQRKuc5M/50001 AND IT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST UNHAPPY YEAR OF MY LIFE
trainval/znO7UHpxgTI/50001 MY PARENTS THOUGHT IT BE GREAT PRACTICE TO PUT ME IN MY LEGS AND HAVE ME DO DISHES
trainval/znO7UHpxgTI/50002 SO WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS THE LATEST VERSION OF MY BETTER HALF
trainval/znO7UHpxgTI/50003 BUT A BUNCH OF OLD GUYS GOT TOGETHER AND THEY NOTICED YOU DIDN'T HAVE LEGS AND THEY WERE JUST PUT YOU ON
trainval/znO7UHpxgTI/50004 WELL I GUESS THAT PART'S ARGUABLE
trainval/znO7UHpxgTI/50005 UNFORTUNATELY THIS COSTS ABOUT 100 GRAND IS NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE AND A LOT OF THE USERS FOUND THEY DON'T EVEN REALLY ENJOY
trainval/znO7UHpxgTI/50006 DISABILITY IS ALSO AN INTERESTING DEMOGRAPHIC IN TERMS OF PEOPLE ENTERING THE DEMOGRAPHIC AND REHABBING OUT OF IT
trainval/znO7UHpxgTI/50007 THAT NUMBER COULD INCREASE BASED ON THE LIFE SPANS INCREASING
trainval/znO7UHpxgTI/50008 A PROSTHESIS THAT WAS DESIGNED I WAS BORN WITHOUT LEGS DESIGNED TO FILL THAT
trainval/znO7UHpxgTI/50009 THERE'S JUST A NUMBER OF THINGS WE DON'T KNOW ALL OF THEM LEADING TO
trainval/znO7UHpxgTI/50010 DISABILITY IS HERE TO STAY AND IT'S GOING TO AFFECT PEOPLE IN A BROADER RANGE THAN MOST OF US WANT TO
trainval/znO7UHpxgTI/50012 ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS YOU'LL NOTICE THIS IS TRUE FOR MANY PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT DISABILITIES IS THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT
trainval/ZoDYTYSeuN8/50001 SO I PRESENTED THE PATIENT TO MY SENIOR RESIDENT I ORDERED SOME CRUTCHES FOR HIM TO GO OUT ON WROTE HIM A PRESCRIPTION FOR NON
trainval/ZoDYTYSeuN8/50002 EVERYONE WAS FULLY ENGAGED DURING THE PRESENTATION AND EVERYONE MADE MISTAKES
trainval/ZoDYTYSeuN8/50003 I COULD'VE MADE THE SAME ERROR
trainval/ZoDYTYSeuN8/50004 IN 1998 I WAS A FIRST YEAR EMERGENCY MEDICINE RESIDENT AT CHARITY HOSPITAL IN NEW ORLEANS
trainval/ZoDYTYSeuN8/50005 ONE DAY I SAW A 70 YEAR OLD MAN A PATIENT WHOSE CHIEF COMPLAINT WAS
trainval/ZoDYTYSeuN8/50006 A LONG STRAIN OF VERY INNOVATIVE PRODUCT LAUNCHES WITHOUT A SERIOUS MISSTEP
trainval/ZoDYTYSeuN8/50007 FOR EXAMPLE DURING HIS SECOND TENURE AT APPLE STEVE JOBS WOULD SELECT 100 OF THE SMARTEST PEOPLE
trainval/ZoDYTYSeuN8/50008 HE MUST'VE FOUND A WAY TO KEEP THE ERRORS AND FAILINGS ON THE INSIDE OF THE COMPANY
trainval/ZoDYTYSeuN8/50009 HOW LONG SHOULD WE PERSIST
trainval/ZoDYTYSeuN8/50010 HOW LONG SHOULD WE CONTINUE TO FAIL
trainval/ZoDYTYSeuN8/50011 YOU'RE NOT AS OBJECTIVE AS YOU THINK
trainval/ZoDYTYSeuN8/50012 SO I ASKED HIM
trainval/ZOlBqdkN2jY/50001 LIKE THEY TOOK ALL OF THE WICKED OUT OF MY WITCH
trainval/ZOlBqdkN2jY/50002 IT IS HARD TO BE POWERFUL WHEN YOU ARE CONSTANTLY BENDING YOUR BONES INTO MORE SWALLOWABLE SHAPES
trainval/ZOlBqdkN2jY/50003 THE SLAM OF METAL A POOR SUBSTITUTE FOR BONE AND MY SISTER DOES WHAT ALL GIRLS KNOW HOW TO DO WHICH IS TO
trainval/ZOlBqdkN2jY/50004 A LEGACY OF WOMEN WITH OPEN MOUTHS AND RIGID SPINES
trainval/ZOlBqdkN2jY/50005 I HOPE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE CRUNCH OF AN OCEAN PUNCHED INTO YOUR JAW
trainval/ZOlBqdkN2jY/50006 WHICH IS TO SAY YOU SHOULD BE AFRAID
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50001 IT'S OBSESSED GREAT THINKERS
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50002 JOHN ARCHIBALD WHEELER ONE OF THE GREAT PHYSICISTS OF THE 20TH CENTURY THE TEACHER OF RICHARD FEYNMAN THE
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50003 AND I'VE NO DOUBT THERE ARE FIVE EINSTEINS IN THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50004 IT WAS TOWARDS THE END OF THE 17TH CENTURY THE PHILOSOPHER LEIBNIZ WHO ASKED IT A
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50005 THAT'S HOW POWERFUL GOD IS
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50006 HE DOESN'T NEED ANY PREEXISTING MATERIALS TO FASHION A WORLD OUT OF
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50007 HE CAN MAKE IT OUT OF SHEER NOTHINGNESS CREATION EX NIHILO
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50008 AND BY THE WAY THIS IS WHAT MOST AMERICANS TODAY BELIEVE
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50009 GOD MADE IT
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50010 NOW IF YOU'RE A BUDDHIST YOU MIGHT WANT TO STOP RIGHT THERE BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU'VE GOT IS
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50011 IT'S JUST A BIG COSMIC VACUITY
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50012 HE SEES PHYSICAL LAWS AS BEING LIKE DIVINE COMMANDS
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50013 THEY DON'T EXIST OUTSIDE THE WORLD
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50014 THEY DON'T HAVE ANY ONTIC CLOUD OF THEIR OWN
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50015 THEY CAN'T CALL A WORLD INTO EXISTENCE OUT OF NOTHINGNESS
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50016 THAT'S A VERY PRIMITIVE VIEW OF WHAT A SCIENTIFIC LAW IS
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50018 WHAT BREATHES FIRE INTO THE EQUATIONS AND CREATES A WORLD FOR THEM TO DESCRIBE
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50019 ALSO A YOUNGER PHYSICIST MAX TEGMARK WHO BELIEVES THAT ALL
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50020 NOW WHAT'S IN BETWEEN THESE TWO EXTREMES
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50021 THE FULLEST POSSIBLE REALITY THAT'S SPECIAL
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50022 AND INDEED I WOULD SAY THAT'S THE REALITY WE LIVE IN
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50023 THAT'S WHAT SCIENCE IS TELLING US
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50024 THAT'S THE COSMIC QUESTION IT SORT OF RHYMES WITH A MORE INTIMATE QUESTION WHY DO I EXIST
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50025 WHY DO YOU EXIST
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50026 DO WE WANT TO LIVE IN A SPECIAL REALITY
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50027 SO MY CHOICES ARE MEANINGLESS
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50028 SO WE DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN THAT SPECIAL REALITY
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50029 BUT I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING TO CONCLUDE THAT I GUARANTEE YOU WILL ASTONISH YOU BECAUSE IT'S ASTONISHED
trainval/zORUUqJd81M/50030 AND I KNOW YOU FEEL IT
trainval/zOSaCQ6xHS8/50001 I WHISTLED ALONE I WHISTLED IN THE CLASSROOM I WHISTLED ON BIKE I WHISTLED EVERYWHERE
trainval/zOSaCQ6xHS8/50002 AND I ALSO WHISTLED AT A CHRISTMAS EVE PARTY WITH MY FAMILY IN LAW
trainval/zOSaCQ6xHS8/50003 BUT IT CAN ALSO SOUND LIKE THIS
trainval/zOSaCQ6xHS8/50004 I LOST MY FACE
trainval/ZOYoTup1t3A/50001 I GREW UP CALLING EVERY SINGLE NIGERIAN WOMEN AUNTY AND COUSIN WAS
trainval/ZOYoTup1t3A/50002 IF YOU WANT TO REMEMBER THE IMPORTANCE OF THE BEAT REMEMBER HOW IT WORKS
trainval/ZOYoTup1t3A/50003 SING IT TOGETHER
trainval/ZOYoTup1t3A/50004 WHICH GOT ME THINKING ABOUT WHAT MAKES NIGERIA HOME EVEN WHEN I HAVEN'T BEEN THERE FOR
trainval/Zp0pEmSkXiM/50001 SO I DECIDED TO CHANGE THAT
trainval/Zp0pEmSkXiM/50002 I BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO CREATE
trainval/Zp0pEmSkXiM/50003 THE MORE PEOPLE MEET THE MORE THEY DISCUSS THE MORE THEY CREATE
trainval/zpNBwNgWejs/50001 DON'T LIKE SHARE RETWEET CALL ME NAMES WITHOUT AT LEAST THINKING
trainval/zpNBwNgWejs/50002 IN SHORT DOING EVERYTHING THAT A CARTOONIST SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO IN A FREE SOCIETY
trainval/zpoGgUoqkkQ/50001 THIS TECHNIQUE WILL BRING YOU THERE
trainval/ZpT0cw9bmiw/50001 WE'D ACTUALLY DONE ALMOST NO THEATER
trainval/ZpT0cw9bmiw/50002 BUT WE KNEW WHAT WE WERE PASSIONATE ABOUT AND IT WAS A WHOLE SERIES OF THINGS THAT WE HAD NEVER SEEN
trainval/ZpT0cw9bmiw/50003 AT BLUE MAN GROUP ITERATION WAS ESSENTIAL FOR OUR CREATIVE PROCESS
trainval/ZpT0cw9bmiw/50004 WE WERE WRITING A PIECE WHERE WE WERE TRYING TO ILLUSTRATE THE CONSUMPTION WASTE
trainval/ZpT0cw9bmiw/50005 WE HAD SET DESIGNS
trainval/ZpT0cw9bmiw/50006 WE DON'T SHY AWAY FROM THE MORE TRADITIONAL METHODS LIKE DIRECT INSTRUCTION WHEN IT'S THE BEST WAY
trainval/Zq7QPnqLoUk/50001 I ASKED HER HOW SHE DID THIS
trainval/Zq7QPnqLoUk/50002 WHAT SHE DIDN'T KNOW WAS THAT I THOUGHT MY LIFE WAS TERRIBLY BORING AND THE LAST THING I WANTED TO DO WAS TO WRITE
trainval/Zq7QPnqLoUk/50003 I WATCHED THE MAN OPEN A PACK OF CIGARETTES WITH TREMBLING
trainval/Zq7QPnqLoUk/50004 OUR NEIGHBORHOOD WAS FULL OF LARGE FAMILIES WHERE FATHERS WERE THE HEADS OF HOUSEHOLDS SO I GREW UP
trainval/Zq7QPnqLoUk/50005 AND THIS IS WHAT I DISCOVERED IN BOSTON THAT FRUSTRATION WAS VERY STIMULATING
trainval/Zq7QPnqLoUk/50006 HE SAID WELL LOOK AT IT
trainval/Zq7QPnqLoUk/50007 WHEN IDENTITY POLITICS TRIES TO PUT LABELS ON US IT IS OUR FREEDOM OF IMAGINATION THAT IS IN
trainval/Zq7QPnqLoUk/50008 SOME PEOPLE CRITICIZED OTHERS PRAISED ME FOR WRITING ABOUT THE TURKISH ARMENIAN CONFLICT
trainval/Zq7QPnqLoUk/50009 IT WAS JUST A STORY
trainval/Zq7QPnqLoUk/50011 ONE DRAWS BOUNDARIES
trainval/Zq7QPnqLoUk/50012 THE OTHER RECOGNIZES NO FRONTIERS
trainval/Zq7QPnqLoUk/50013 I LIKE IT WHEN MY CHARACTERS SURPRISE ME
trainval/ZQBSh9k74aY/50001 I'LL SHARE A STORY WITH YOU
trainval/ZQBSh9k74aY/50002 WHAT I'VE JUST DESCRIBED TO YOU IS WHAT COSPLAY IS
trainval/ZQBSh9k74aY/50003 THEY SIT DOWN AT THE PIANO AND THEY PLAY A SONG
trainval/ZQBSh9k74aY/50004 SHE'D NEVER BEEN TO A CONVENTION BEFORE
trainval/ZQBSh9k74aY/50005 SHE'D NEVER MADE A COSTUME
trainval/ZQBSh9k74aY/50006 SHE WAS AFRAID SHE COULDN'T DO IT
trainval/ZQBSh9k74aY/50007 SEE IT AS A CHALLENGE BECAUSE YOU CAN DO ANYTHING
trainval/ZQBSh9k74aY/50008 DON'T LET THAT POSITIVITY END WITH YOU
trainval/ZQElzjCsl9o/50001 MY CLAIM IS THAT UNDERSTANDING HAS TO DO WITH THE ABILITY TO CHANGE YOUR PERSPECTIVE
trainval/ZQElzjCsl9o/50002 I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT HOW AMAZING REPRESENTING SOMETHING ACTUALLY IS
trainval/ZQElzjCsl9o/50003 SO THAT IS MY CLAIM
trainval/ZQElzjCsl9o/50004 AND I WANT TO FOCUS ON MATHEMATICS
trainval/ZQElzjCsl9o/50005 WE FIND PATTERNS AND WE REPRESENT THEM
trainval/ZQElzjCsl9o/50006 I TRULY BELIEVE THIS
trainval/ZQElzjCsl9o/50007 LET'S PLAY AROUND WITH THE EARTH
trainval/ZQElzjCsl9o/50009 BUT THIS IS FOUR THIRDS
trainval/ZQElzjCsl9o/50010 OK SO WHY AM I DOING ALL THIS
trainval/zqLYcJ6Ib3c/50001 WE OFFER HIGH QUALITY YEAR ROUND SPORTS PROGRAMS FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL
trainval/zqLYcJ6Ib3c/50002 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
trainval/zqnZCSVsqPw/50001 THEY SAID THAT IF MY T A MARY' WHO WAS THE CULTURE MAVEN IN THE FAMILY WOULD TAKE ME
trainval/zqnZCSVsqPw/50002 I ASKED HER AND SHE AGREED AND I WAS OFF TO MY FIRST NEW YORK FILM FESTIVAL
trainval/zqnZCSVsqPw/50003 THEY MAKE FILMS LIKE THAT IN CUBA
trainval/zqnZCSVsqPw/50004 WHY NOT CREATE YOUR OWN FILM FESTIVAL
trainval/zSbCNWyYams/50001 BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT LET'S BACK UP A BIT
trainval/zSbCNWyYams/50002 IT IS NOT ONE OF THOSE CONCEPTS IN LIFE THAT APPLIES TO MOST OF US OR 99 OF
trainval/zSbCNWyYams/50003 YOU CAN RINSE AND REPEAT WHICH IS TO DO THE SAME EXACT THING OVER AGAIN AND EXPECT
trainval/zSbCNWyYams/50004 THIS IS SOMETHING THAT A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF US DO AND THAT IS TO STEP
trainval/zSbCNWyYams/50005 THERE ARE 7
trainval/zSbCNWyYams/50006 IT WAS UNCONVENTIONAL BUT IT WORKED
trainval/zSbCNWyYams/50007 I SOUGHT TO START THE FIRST HIGH SCHOOL CHAPTER
trainval/zSbCNWyYams/50008 HERE IS ONE OF THEM SHOWN
trainval/ZSbKuSsYHVY/50001 I INVITE YOU TO TAKE THAT RISK WITH ME
trainval/ZSbKuSsYHVY/50002 I HOPE YOU'LL TAKE IT WITH ME
trainval/zsLz0mRmEG0/50001 UNTIL ONE DAY SHE CAME BACK TO MY OFFICE AND SHE WAS BAWLING SHE WAS JUST CRYING
trainval/zsLz0mRmEG0/50002 AND I HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE COME OUT OF THAT PIECE SAYING OH MY GOD I WAS SO FRUSTRATED
trainval/zsLz0mRmEG0/50003 I HAVE TO REALLY FOLLOW BEST JOURNALISTIC PRACTICES AND MAKE SURE THAT THESE POWERFUL
trainval/zsLz0mRmEG0/50004 NAMED GEORGE ZIMMERMAN WHO ENDED UP SHOOTING AND KILLING HIM
trainval/zsLz0mRmEG0/50005 WE'RE CREATING MOBILE PIECES LIKE THE TRAYVON MARTIN PIECE
trainval/zsLz0mRmEG0/50006 I'VE HAD AMERICANS TELL ME THAT THEY'VE DONATED DIRECT DEDUCTIONS FROM THEIR BANK ACCOUNT MONEY TO GO TO SYRIAN CHILDREN
trainval/zSqYtUeKUl4/50001 YOU'RE NOT VERY COOL ARE YOU
trainval/zSqYtUeKUl4/50002 A HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE FIRST FORESTER OF THE COMMONWEALTH ROTHROCK WROTE ABOUT THE PENNSYLVANIA DESERT
trainval/zSqYtUeKUl4/50003 BUT WE HIT THE CRISIS IN A WORLD WHERE WE MIGHT HAVE COMMITTED OURSELVES TO ENOUGH SEA LEVEL RISE TO DISAPPEAR OUT OF THAT
trainval/ZSRaJIMYSMs/50001 WHAT DO I HAVE TO TALK ABOUT
trainval/ZSRaJIMYSMs/50002 I'M A PROUD MOM
trainval/ZSRaJIMYSMs/50003 ESPECIALLY NOW MY OLDEST SON IS OFF TO UNIVERSITY
trainval/ZSRaJIMYSMs/50004 I TAKE THAT JOB SERIOUSLY I WORRY 24 7
trainval/ZSRaJIMYSMs/50005 AND YOU KNOW WHAT
trainval/ZSRaJIMYSMs/50006 ONE DAY I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK LISTENING TO THE RADIO AND I REMEMBER LISTENING TO ALL THESE
trainval/ZSRaJIMYSMs/50007 AND TO MENTOR KIDS SO THAT EVENTUALLY THEY CAN DIRECT THEIR OWN LEARNING
trainval/ZSRaJIMYSMs/50008 THINK ABOUT IT WHAT'S YOUR GOAL
trainval/ZSRaJIMYSMs/50009 I TALK TO A LOT OF PARENTS IN THE U
trainval/ZSRaJIMYSMs/50010 AND IF YOU WANT TO DO EVEN BETTER THEN YOU SHOW UP WITH A GOAL
trainval/ZSRaJIMYSMs/50011 YOUR JOB IS TO UNCOVER YOUR CHILD'S TALENTS AND HELP THEM DEVELOP THEM AND HELP
trainval/ZSRaJIMYSMs/50012 NOW IT'S TIME TO PUT THEM TO USE
trainval/ZSRaJIMYSMs/50013 AND THIS IS THE IMPORTANT STEP
trainval/ZSRaJIMYSMs/50014 AND WE PRAISED THE EFFORT WE PRAISED THE PROCESS AND NOT THE RESULT
trainval/ZSRaJIMYSMs/50015 WE SAID IF IT WAS EASY EVERYBODY WOULD BE DOING IT
trainval/ZSRaJIMYSMs/50016 OH MY GOSH THIS IS GREAT
trainval/ZSRaJIMYSMs/50017 WHY IS THIS RIVER ORANGE
trainval/ZSRaJIMYSMs/50018 HE LOVED THE HISTORY THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND POLITICAL ISSUES BEHIND IT AND THE CHEMISTRY
trainval/ZSRaJIMYSMs/50019 NOBODY DIED FROM LOSING
trainval/ZSRaJIMYSMs/50020 BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE MOTIVATED TO IMPROVE FOR THE NEXT TIME AND YOU'RE INSPIRED BY THE OTHER PEOPLE'S
trainval/ZSRaJIMYSMs/50021 OR YOU WANT TO WRITE VIDEO ABOUT YOUR PROJECT AND ITS IMPACT
trainval/ZSRaJIMYSMs/50022 OR YOU WRITE AN ESSAY AND YOU TELL ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH IT
trainval/ZSRaJIMYSMs/50023 KNOW THAT PETTY RULES STIFLE CURIOSITY AND CREATIVITY SO HAVE LESS RULES AND
trainval/ZSRaJIMYSMs/50024 BECAUSE IF YOU LIVE IN THE BOX IT'S REALLY HARD TO THINK OUTSIDE OF IT
trainval/ZSRaJIMYSMs/50025 THAT'S YOUR JOB
trainval/ZSRaJIMYSMs/50026 SO TAKE THE TIME TO RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUR KIDS
trainval/ZSRaJIMYSMs/50027 TAKE THE TIME TO HELP YOUR KID DISCOVER WHAT HE'S GREAT AT
trainval/zSWppsceZ1c/50001 WE TURN THAT FROWN UPSIDE DOWN
trainval/zSWppsceZ1c/50002 DIAGNOSING UNHAPPINESS ISN'T HARD
trainval/zSWppsceZ1c/50003 THAT'S WHAT THE PAIN IS FOR
trainval/zSWppsceZ1c/50004 I'VE SEEN DOZENS OF ORGANIZATIONS AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SEEK HAPPINESS OR TRY TO MAINTAIN THEIR INTEGRITY
trainval/zSWppsceZ1c/50005 HAPPINESS AND INTEGRITY THEY CAN'T BE REACHED BY WALKING AWAY FROM UNHAPPINESS
trainval/zSWppsceZ1c/50006 UNHAPPINESS IS THE FRONT DOOR
trainval/zSWppsceZ1c/50007 I CAN NEVER REMEMBER RIGHT
trainval/zSWppsceZ1c/50008 UNHAPPINESS IS THE DOORWAY
trainval/zSXchYY3bnU/50001 BUT I WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE SCHOOL BECAUSE MY POOR MOTHER COULDN'T AFFORD SCHOOLING
trainval/zSXchYY3bnU/50002 AND THEN HE SAID WELL I MUST GIVE THEM A CAR THAT THEY CAN AFFORD ONE LAKH CAR 2000 CAR
trainval/zSXchYY3bnU/50003 CAN YOU BELIEVE IT
trainval/zSXchYY3bnU/50004 ALL THE TIME YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN AN ENVELOPE
trainval/zSXchYY3bnU/50005 AND THEREFORE EACH COMPONENT HAD TO HAVE A DUAL FUNCTIONALITY
trainval/zSXchYY3bnU/50006 AND INFANTS DIE
trainval/zSXchYY3bnU/50007 NO I'M SORRY
trainval/zSXchYY3bnU/50009 IT'S NOT JUST INNOVATION COMPASSION AND PASSION COMPASSION IN THE HEART AND PASSION IN THE BELLY
trainval/zSXchYY3bnU/50010 THAT'S THE NEW WORLD THAT WE WANT TO CREATE
trainval/ztGkmruGPqM/50001 WE DON'T PRIORITIZE IT
trainval/ztGkmruGPqM/50002 DO THEY NEED AN ALARM CLOCK TO WAKE UP
trainval/Ztl2li6GTWg/50001 I WANT TO GO HOME THE SAME WAY I CAME TO WORK
trainval/Ztl2li6GTWg/50002 I WAS IN RECEIVING AND RELEASING ONE DAY WORKING OVERTIME AND THERE WAS AN INMATE HE WAS PACING BACK AND FORTH
trainval/Ztl2li6GTWg/50004 I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE PROGRAMS ARE
trainval/Ztl2li6GTWg/50005 I'VE GOT A GOOD MEMORY
trainval/Ztl2li6GTWg/50007 I SEE THEM STRIVING TO BE BETTER
trainval/Ztl2li6GTWg/50008 I SEE THEM PUT TOGETHER SELF HELP GROUPS
trainval/Ztl2li6GTWg/50009 I SEE THEM PUT TOGETHER WORK GROUPS
trainval/Ztl2li6GTWg/50010 THAT WAY WHEN YOU DEAL WITH AN INMATE YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE COMING FROM BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY DEAL WITH RESPECT
trainval/Ztl2li6GTWg/50011 I SEE THE REHAB
trainval/zuAj2F54bdo/50001 FOR POWER IS NOT JUST MOVING LATERALLY FROM NATION TO NATION
trainval/zuAj2F54bdo/50002 IT'S ALSO MOVING VERTICALLY
trainval/zuAj2F54bdo/50003 WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY IS THAT THE POWER THAT WAS ENCASED HELD TO ACCOUNTABILITY HELD TO THE RULE OF LAW
trainval/zuAj2F54bdo/50004 THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN POETRY THE POEM IS A SHROPSHIRE LAD WRITTEN BY A
trainval/zuAj2F54bdo/50005 AND IF YOU LOOK YOU CAN SEE THEM HAPPENING ALREADY BEGINNING TO EMERGE
trainval/zuAj2F54bdo/50006 YOU'RE BEGINNING TO SEE THE EMERGENCE OF A MULTI POLAR WORLD
trainval/zuAj2F54bdo/50007 UP UNTIL NOW THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN THE DOMINANT FEATURE OF OUR WORLD
trainval/zuAj2F54bdo/50008 THEY WILL REMAIN THE MOST POWERFUL NATION BUT THEY WILL BE THE MOST POWERFUL NATION IN AN INCREASINGLY MULTI POLAR WORLD
trainval/zuAj2F54bdo/50009 THERE WAS A BALANCE A FIVE SIDED BALANCE
trainval/zuAj2F54bdo/50010 WELL IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE'RE NOW SEEING A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT OF POWER BROADLY SPEAKING AWAY FROM NATIONS GATHERED AROUND THE
trainval/zuAj2F54bdo/50011 BRITAIN ALWAYS PLAYED TO THE BALANCE
trainval/zuAj2F54bdo/50012 IF PARIS GOT TOGETHER WITH BERLIN BRITAIN GOT TOGETHER WITH VIENNA AND ROME TO PROVIDE A COUNTERBALANCE
trainval/zuAj2F54bdo/50013 BUT A MULTIPLE POLARITY OF POWER MEANS SHIFTING AND CHANGING ALLIANCES
trainval/zuAj2F54bdo/50014 NOTE THAT WHEN WE WENT INTO LIBYA IT WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE WEST TO DO IT ALONE WE HAD TO
trainval/zuAj2F54bdo/50015 WE HAD TO BRING IN THIS CASE THE ARAB LEAGUE IN
trainval/zuAj2F54bdo/50016 COMMAND IN THE WORLD TODAY
trainval/zuAj2F54bdo/50017 OF COURSE THEY ARE THEY ARE A MERCANTILIST NATION
trainval/zuAj2F54bdo/50018 THEY WANT TO KEEP THE SEA LANES OPEN
trainval/zuAj2F54bdo/50019 INCREASINGLY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO BUSINESS WITH PEOPLE WITH WHOM WE DO NOT SHARE VALUES
trainval/zuAj2F54bdo/50020 WE ARE NOW INTERDEPENDENT
trainval/zuAj2F54bdo/50021 YOU IN BUSINESS KNOW THAT THE PARADIGM STRUCTURE OF OUR TIME LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IS THE NETWORK
trainval/zuAj2F54bdo/50022 THE POEM IS CALLED NO MAN IS AN ISLAND
trainval/zuAj2F54bdo/50023 YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IN INDUSTRY GOVERNMENTS DON'T
trainval/ZuCtZJGcEMU/50001 I NEEDED TO HEAD TOWARDS CONSERVATION GOALS
trainval/ZuCtZJGcEMU/50002 JUST GET WHATEVER ANYBODY WANTS
trainval/ZuCX92wuw2g/50001 AND THAT SENSE THAT I HAD WASN'T JUST A SENSE IT'S THE TRUTH
trainval/ZuCX92wuw2g/50002 SO I BECAME SO FRUSTRATED AND MY WIFE BECAME FRUSTRATED SO WE DECIDED TO GO START UP OUR OWN
trainval/ZuCX92wuw2g/50003 AS PART OF THAT PROMISE WE DO NOT SPEND ANY MONEY ON NORTH AMERICAN SALARIES THAT
trainval/ZuCX92wuw2g/50004 AND THIS WOULD LIKELY HAPPEN ONE BY ONE
trainval/ZUGOaSux6pU/50001 MY EARLIEST CHILDHOOD MEMORIES ARE OF TRIPLE BEAM SCALES USED TO WEIGH OUTRAGEOUS AMOUNTS OF
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50001 I BRUSHED IT OFF HOPING THAT IT WAS JUST A SPORTS INJURY
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50002 MAYBE I HAD PINCHED A NERVE WHILE WEIGHTLIFTING
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50003 I WAS FINALLY GIVING ANESTHESIA FOR THE FIRST TIME AS A STUDENT
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50004 WHEN THIS HAPPENS YOU HAVE A FEW CHOICES
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50005 IT'S THEN AT THAT POINT UNABLE TO SEE STRAIGHT USE MY DOMINANT HAND OR FEEL THREE QUARTERS OF MY BODY THAT EVEN
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50006 I SOMEHOW MADE MY WAY BACK TO THE LOCKER ROOM AND I CALLED MY TEACHER
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50007 MY HOSPITAL ADMISSION WAS FULL OF SPINAL TAPS AND MRI SCANS IV INFUSIONS AND
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50008 WELL MS IS SORT OF THE SAME SITUATION
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50009 A LESION COULD POP UP IN THE SPEECH CENTER OF YOUR BRAIN CAUSING YOU TO TALK FUNNY
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50010 IN ADDITION TO THE VARIETY OF SYMPTOMS THERE'RE ALSO A FEW DIFFERENT TYPES OF MS
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50011 I NEVER KNOW WHAT'S AROUND THE CORNER
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50012 I DON'T KNOW IF TOMORROW IS GOING TO BE A GOOD DAY OR A BAD ONE
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50013 I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE NEXT RELAPSE IS COMING OR WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO TO ME
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50014 SHE WASN'T PARTICULARLY GOOD AT IT WHICH I ACCEPTED AS A PERSONAL CHALLENGE BECAUSE NEUROLOGY IS MY PASSION
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50015 NOTE THE ABSENCE OF DEEP TENDON REFLEXES I EXCLAIMED AS SHE UNSUCCESSFULLY TAPED ON MY KNEES WITH THE REFLEX
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50016 I'M NOT HAVING A RELAPSE RIGHT NOW BUT THE MS VERSION OF REMISSION IS DIFFERENT THAN YOU MIGHT THINK
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50017 THEN I DECIDED TO PUT MY KNOWLEDGE TO USE IN THE BEST WAY A GRADUATE STUDENT KNOWS HOW
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50018 BY TAKING AN EXAM
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50019 AND THAT'S HOW I BECAME A BOARD CERTIFIED MS NURSE JUST SIX MONTHS AFTER BEING DIAGNOSED WITH
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50020 RECOVERY FROM A RELAPSE IS NOT GUARANTEED AND THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW WITH CERTAINTY WHETHER A LOSS OF FUNCTION IS
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50021 AM I GOING TO DIE FROM THIS
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50022 AM I GOING TO END UP IN A WHEELCHAIR
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50023 IT'S A LOT TO TAKE IN
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50024 MY MISSION IS TO EDUCATE EMPOWER AND HELP WORK TOWARDS A DAY WHEN A YOUNG
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50025 CLINICAL RESEARCH IS UNDERFUNDED TIME CONSUMING AND
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50026 WE'RE HOPING THAT BY CROWDSOURCING A HUGE DATA BANK THAT RESEARCHERS CAN TAP INTO
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50027 MAYBE EVEN USE IT TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50028 CUT THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND MONEY THAT IT TAKES TO RUN A STUDY
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50029 MAYBE EVEN GET US TOWARDS A CURE FASTER
trainval/zuLOT6GsAxw/50030 IN FACT IT WAS PRETTY MUCH THE OPPOSITE
trainval/zUS5GcqzHNM/50001 WE SEE IT IN ADVERTISEMENTS
trainval/zUS5GcqzHNM/50002 WHAT ARE THE FIRST WORDS THAT COME TO MIND WHEN YOU PICTURE A PREGNANT WOMAN
trainval/zUS5GcqzHNM/50003 I ALSO ASKED HETEROSEXUAL MEN TO IMAGINE A WOMAN THAT THEY'RE PARTNERED WITH IS PREGNANT AND THEN ASKED WOMEN TO
trainval/zUS5GcqzHNM/50004 THEY EXPERIENCE LESS SEXISM
trainval/zUS5GcqzHNM/50005 SHE WAS AN OBJECT
trainval/zUS5GcqzHNM/50006 I'VE TAKEN TO CALLING THIS THE WILLENDORF EFFECT AND ONCE AGAIN WE SEE IT REINFORCED IN MANY ASPECTS OF HER
trainval/ZVRbSuY3h9w/50001 DO YOU HAVE ANY FRIENDS
trainval/ZVRbSuY3h9w/50002 SO I APOLOGIZE IF I MOVE QUICKLY BUT I HAVE FULL FAITH THAT YOU'LL HAVE NO PROBLEM KEEPING UP
trainval/ZVRbSuY3h9w/50003 DO YOU HAVE ANY FRIENDS WITH WHOM YOU ARE NOT FACEBOOK FRIENDS
trainval/ZVRbSuY3h9w/50004 OR WITH WHOM YOU DO NOT ENGAGE IN ANY SOCIAL MEDIA INTERACTION AT ALL
trainval/ZVRbSuY3h9w/50005 WHAT HAS FRIENDSHIP BECOME IN THE AGE OF FACEBOOK
trainval/ZVRbSuY3h9w/50007 AFTER THIS AWESOME CONFERENCE IS OVER YOU'RE GOING TO GO OUT WITH YOUR FRIENDS PERHAPS TO THE AFTER PARTY
trainval/ZVRbSuY3h9w/50008 CHANCES ARE I MEAN YOU'RE A COOL AND YOU'RE HERE SO THEY'RE PROBABLY PRETTY COOL TOO
trainval/ZVS5I2RMTGM/50002 BUT THIS TIME AFTER ABOUT 30 MINUTES SHE STARTS TO CRACK A SMILE
trainval/ZVS5I2RMTGM/50003 AND WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS
trainval/ZVS5I2RMTGM/50004 SHE'S LAUGHING SHE TRUSTS ME
trainval/ZVS5I2RMTGM/50005 AND NOW I'M WORRIED
trainval/ZVS5I2RMTGM/50006 WHY HAVEN'T YOU TAKEN A SHOWER
trainval/ZVS5I2RMTGM/50007 SHE SAYS I CAN'T
trainval/ZVS5I2RMTGM/50008 HE COULD HAVE JUDGED ME LIKE THOSE ON THE BUS
trainval/ZVS5I2RMTGM/50009 HE CHOSE COMPASSION
trainval/ZVS5I2RMTGM/50010 BECAUSE JUDGEMENT AND SHAME PERPETUATES THIS ILLNESS
trainval/ZVS5I2RMTGM/50011 I FOUND MYSELF TRYING TO ESCAPE
trainval/ZvSJE9n0GfA/50001 I HAVE DONE MOST OF MY LIFE
trainval/ZvSJE9n0GfA/50002 AND I KNEW IT WAS IMPORTANT
trainval/ZvSJE9n0GfA/50003 HOW COULD IT NOT BE GOOD FOR ME
trainval/ZvSJE9n0GfA/50004 SHE WAS IN HER
trainval/zvvZEIGNLo0/50001 JOHN HAMMOND IS REFLECTING HE'S PLAYED BY THE LATE LORD RICHARD ATTENBOROUGH AND HE'S REFLECTING ON HIS
trainval/zvvZEIGNLo0/50002 WHEN I SAW JURASSIC PARK I WAS BLOWN AWAY
trainval/zvvZEIGNLo0/50003 WE MEASURED THEIR PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES WHILE THEY WATCHED THESE
trainval/zvvZEIGNLo0/50004 SO I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW FILM HAS CHANGED
trainval/zvvZEIGNLo0/50005 WE DON'T HAVE TO REFLECT ON THIS RIGHT
trainval/zvvZEIGNLo0/50006 I MEAN HOW REAL CAN FILMS GET
trainval/zvvZEIGNLo0/50007 HE THOUGHT HE WAS A REAL PRISONER
trainval/zvwQXwJyaj0/50001 I WENT TO SEE THIS SPECIALIST AND SHE WAS TOP OF THE FIELD AND TOLD ME I HAD TO STOP
trainval/zvwQXwJyaj0/50002 IT'S A MILE HIGH AND I GREW UP THERE WITH MY 10 BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND TWO ADORING PARENTS
trainval/zvwQXwJyaj0/50003 I KNEW ANOTHER YOUNG MAN THOUGH WHO HAD PH WHO DIED WHILE WAITING FOR ONE
trainval/zvwQXwJyaj0/50004 MY PARENTS WERE TOTALLY STRESSED OUT ABOUT ME GOING AND AUDITIONING AND
trainval/zw9NXY3xOOI/50001 AND IT TOOK 18 MONTHS
trainval/zw9NXY3xOOI/50002 BUT WHAT IF YOU WANT TO SEE BRUSH STROKES
trainval/zw9NXY3xOOI/50003 IT'S CALLED COLLECTIONS
trainval/zw9NXY3xOOI/50004 AND THE ANSWER IS NO
trainval/ZWfCi9WxK1E/50001 CAN YOU COMMENT
trainval/ZWfCi9WxK1E/50002 HOW THEIR WALKING STICKS KEPT THE FLAMES ALIVE
trainval/ZWfCi9WxK1E/50003 WILL IT STING LESS IF I SAY IT SOFTLY
trainval/zwjLQgNd7XM/50001 AND WITH THAT CALL MY LIFE WOULD CHANGE FOREVER
trainval/zwjLQgNd7XM/50002 WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF OILED PENGUINS AND THOUSANDS OF WILLING BUT
trainval/zwjLQgNd7XM/50003 IN FACT MANY PEOPLE COMPARED IT TO A WAR ZONE
trainval/zwjLQgNd7XM/50004 I WAS INSTANTLY TRANSPORTED BACK TO THAT MOMENT IN TIME
trainval/zwjLQgNd7XM/50005 PENGUINS ARE VERY VOCAL BIRDS AND REALLY REALLY NOISY SO I EXPECTED TO WALK INTO THIS
trainval/zwjLQgNd7XM/50006 THE OIL SLICK WAS NOW MOVING NORTH TOWARDS DASSEN ISLAND AND THE RESCUERS DESPAIRED BECAUSE THEY
trainval/zwjLQgNd7XM/50007 SO IN WILDLIFE RESCUE AS IN LIFE WE LEARN FROM EACH PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE AND
trainval/zwjLQgNd7XM/50008 SO IN THESE SIX YEARS BETWEEN THESE TWO OIL SPILLS THEY'VE BUILT THOUSANDS OF THESE WELL VENTILATED
trainval/zwjLQgNd7XM/50009 AND AS A RESULT DURING THE TREASURE RESCUE JUST 160 PENGUINS DIED
trainval/zwjLQgNd7XM/50010 AND WAS SILVIA GAUS RIGHT
trainval/zwjLQgNd7XM/50011 WELL SHE COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG
trainval/zwjLQgNd7XM/50012 PERSONALLY I LEARNED THAT I AM CAPABLE OF HANDLING SO MUCH MORE THAN I EVER DREAMED POSSIBLE
trainval/zwjLQgNd7XM/50013 JUST LOOK AT THAT 17 YEAR OLD
trainval/zwjLQgNd7XM/50014 AND TRULY TO BE A PART OF SOMETHING SO MUCH LARGER THAN YOURSELF IS THE MOST REWARDING
trainval/zwjLQgNd7XM/50015 AND THE TWO MAIN THREATS TO PENGUINS TODAY ARE OVERFISHING AND GLOBAL WARMING
trainval/zwjLQgNd7XM/50016 SO IF WE EACH DO OUR PART TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND WE CAN HELP KEEP PENGUINS
trainval/zwjLQgNd7XM/50017 HUMANS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE GREATEST THREAT TO PENGUINS BUT WE ARE NOW THEIR ONLY HOPE
trainval/zwjLQgNd7XM/50018 AND THEY'D BEEN USING IT AT SANCCOB WITH GREAT SUCCESS SO THEY BEGAN USING IT DURING THE TREASURE RESCUE
trainval/zwpiI18TBdE/50001 IT HAS BEEN PERVERTED TO MEAN VIOLENT STRUGGLE WHEREVER MUSLIMS ARE UNDERGOING DIFFICULTIES
trainval/zwpiI18TBdE/50002 SO I BECAME INVOLVED IN THE JIHAD IN AFGHANISTAN
trainval/zwpiI18TBdE/50003 I WANTED TO PROTECT THE MUSLIM AFGHAN POPULATION AGAINST THE SOVIET ARMY
trainval/zwpiI18TBdE/50004 AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS JIHAD MY SACRED DUTY WHICH WOULD BE REWARDED BY GOD
trainval/zwpiI18TBdE/50005 I CONFUSED TRUE JIHAD WITH THIS PERVERSION AS PRESENTED BY THE FASCIST
trainval/zwpiI18TBdE/50006 AND IT WAS THE SAME EVERYWHERE
trainval/Zwwanld4T1w/50001 HOW CAN WE HAVE PUBLIC DEBATE ABOUT IMMIGRATION IF WE CAN'T AT LEAST AGREE ON HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ENTERING AND LEAVING THE COUNTRY
trainval/Zwwanld4T1w/50002 SO I BECAME A DATA JOURNALIST
trainval/Zwwanld4T1w/50003 BUT YOU SHOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO TELL WHICH NUMBERS ARE RELIABLE AND WHICH ONES AREN'T
trainval/Zwwanld4T1w/50004 PEOPLE ARE REALLY RELUCTANT TO ANSWER THEIR PHONES TO POLLSTERS AND ALSO SHOCKINGLY ENOUGH PEOPLE MIGHT LIE
trainval/Zwwanld4T1w/50005 BUT YOU WOULDN'T NECESSARILY KNOW THAT TO LOOK AT THE MEDIA
trainval/Zwwanld4T1w/50006 WE DON'T USE DECIMAL PLACES TO DESCRIBE THE TEMPERATURE
trainval/Zwwanld4T1w/50007 WHEN YOU HEAR A STATISTIC YOU MIGHT FEEL SKEPTICAL
trainval/Zwwanld4T1w/50008 AS SOON AS IT'S BURIED IN A CHART IT FEELS LIKE SOME KIND OF OBJECTIVE SCIENCE AND IT'S NOT
trainval/Zwwanld4T1w/50009 I WANTED TO SHOW PEOPLE THE WAY DATA RELATES TO THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES
trainval/Zwwanld4T1w/50011 QUESTIONS LIKE IS IT NORMAL TO SLEEP IN A SEPARATE BED TO MY WIFE
trainval/Zwwanld4T1w/50012 DO PEOPLE REGRET THEIR TATTOOS
trainval/Zwwanld4T1w/50013 I'LL USE ONE LAST EXAMPLE HERE
trainval/Zwwanld4T1w/50014 THEY'RE CIVIL SERVANTS
trainval/Zwwanld4T1w/50015 FIND OUT HOW THEY COLLECTED THE NUMBERS
trainval/zWxFhFZJDks/50001 FOR THE MOST PART EVERYONE WAS JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE
trainval/zWxFhFZJDks/50002 AND IT'S HARD FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS
trainval/zWxFhFZJDks/50003 I UNLOADED TRUCKS
trainval/zWxFhFZJDks/50004 THAT WAS MY FULL TIME JOB UNLOADING TRUCKS AT A FOOD WAREHOUSE FOR 5
trainval/zWxFhFZJDks/50005 THOSE ARE THE CURRENCY
trainval/zWxFhFZJDks/50006 YOU CHARGE ANOTHER INMATE TO CLEAN HIS CELL
trainval/zWxFhFZJDks/50007 THERE'S PRETTY ILLEGAL HUSTLES YOU RUN A TATTOO PARLOR OUT OF YOUR OWN CELL
trainval/zWxFhFZJDks/50008 I LOST A YEAR OF MY LIFE FROM IT
trainval/Zx8uYIfUvh4/50001 THAT'S ALWAYS THERE AND IT'S UNDENIABLE
trainval/Zx8uYIfUvh4/50002 BUT IT WAS DEEPER
trainval/Zx8uYIfUvh4/50003 IT SAYS YOU GO AHEAD
trainval/Zx8uYIfUvh4/50004 YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BLACK THIS BLACK
trainval/Zx8uYIfUvh4/50005 ALL OF THAT'S GREAT AND I DON'T DENIGRATE IT
trainval/Zx8uYIfUvh4/50006 AND THE HYPOTHERMIA SETS IN
trainval/Zx8uYIfUvh4/50007 I JUST WENT INTO THINKING ABOUT THIS DREAM AND WHY AND HOW
trainval/Zx8uYIfUvh4/50008 ON THE BEACH
trainval/Zx8uYIfUvh4/50009 WHEN BONNIE THOUGHT THE BACK OF MY THROAT WAS SWELLING UP SHE BROUGHT THE MEDICAL TEAM OVER TO OUR
trainval/Zx8uYIfUvh4/50010 THE WHOLE THING I JUST THOUGHT IN MY HALLUCINATORY MOMENT THAT I HEARD THE WORD TRACHEOTOMY
trainval/Zx8uYIfUvh4/50011 I DIDN'T DO IT
trainval/Zx8uYIfUvh4/50012 AND WE'LL NEVER FORGET IT
trainval/Zx8uYIfUvh4/50013 IT'LL ALWAYS BE PART OF US
trainval/Zx8uYIfUvh4/50014 I DIDN'T GIVE UP
trainval/Zx8uYIfUvh4/50015 THERE WAS ACTION BEHIND THESE WORDS
trainval/Zx8uYIfUvh4/50016 AND THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT I AM AT THE PRIME OF MY LIFE TODAY
trainval/zXCiv4sc5eY/50001 WHAT ARE WE DOING
trainval/zXCiv4sc5eY/50002 ASK YOURSELF ONE QUESTION
trainval/zXSrqdSohyA/50001 NEARLY ALL OF THEM SAID NO NO WE HAVEN'T
trainval/zXSrqdSohyA/50002 THE DEMAND IS ALREADY THERE RIGHT
trainval/ZxVJt6vQWV8/50001 I'M LUCKY ENOUGH TO MEET A BIG GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING TEXTBOOK FUNDRAISING
trainval/ZxVJt6vQWV8/50002 IT GAVE BACKPACKS TO CHILDREN WHO HAD NEVER HAD BACKPACKS TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL
trainval/ZxVJt6vQWV8/50003 SO THERE'S TWO WAYS TO FIND MONEY THROUGH CREATIVELY LOOKING INTO THE WORLD AROUND YOU BUT ALSO REACHING INTO YOUR OWN
trainval/ZxVJt6vQWV8/50004 THAT'S A LARGE IMPACT TO THINK ABOUT MY MONEY
trainval/ZxVJt6vQWV8/50005 MY SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY EACH WEEK
trainval/ZxVJt6vQWV8/50006 SO IT'S THESE IDEAS THAT I ASK YOU
trainval/ZxVJt6vQWV8/50007 TRY THAT ON
trainval/ZxVJt6vQWV8/50008 INVITE PEOPLE INTO YOUR SPACE
trainval/zyet9fPS24k/50002 THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THAT CAN BE RISKY
trainval/zyet9fPS24k/50003 IT'S KIND OF RISKY STANDING UP HERE ON THE STAGE RIGHT NOW
trainval/zyet9fPS24k/50004 I COULD TOTALLY BLOW IT
trainval/zyet9fPS24k/50005 BUT WHAT'S THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN
trainval/zyet9fPS24k/50006 MAYBE I'D BE EMBARRASSED
trainval/zyet9fPS24k/50007 IT'S SORT OF ILLOGICAL WE SHOULD WANT TO PRESERVE OURSELVES SO WE GET TO THAT RIPE OLD AGE BUT NO
trainval/zyet9fPS24k/50008 YOU DON'T WANT TO FALL IN THAT YOU'LL NEVER COME OUT
trainval/zyet9fPS24k/50009 AVALANCHES OF COURSE
trainval/zyet9fPS24k/50010 YOU CAN GO BACK IN HISTORY AND EVERYBODY HAS DONE THINGS WRONG
trainval/zyet9fPS24k/50011 IT'S SORT OF A METHODOLOGY THAT I CREATED I CALL IT THE M
trainval/zyet9fPS24k/50012 I WANTED TO PUT UP A SLIDE OF A STEAK JUST BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUNNY BUT I DIDN'T GET AROUND TO DOING THAT
trainval/zyet9fPS24k/50013 I'M ACTUALLY A VEGETARIAN SO IT'S EVEN FUNNIER FOR ME
trainval/zyet9fPS24k/50014 METHOD IS MITIGATE
trainval/zyet9fPS24k/50015 THIS FEELS GOOD
trainval/zyet9fPS24k/50016 WE FELT GOOD ABOUT THE SITUATION
trainval/zYhgy5ouYLM/50001 AND AS WE WALK IN IT IS A SCENE I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE YOU AS SAYING IT LOOKED LIKE NORWAY THROW UP
trainval/zYhgy5ouYLM/50002 WHICH ONE WAS MORE IMPORTANT
trainval/zYhgy5ouYLM/50003 THAT LINE ACTUALLY WENT THE OTHER WAY
trainval/zYhgy5ouYLM/50004 OUR MORAL INTEGRITY IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND WE MUST BE PREPARED TO DEFEND IT EVEN WHEN IT'S
trainval/zYhgy5ouYLM/50005 IF IT DOESN'T MATTER TO YOU WHO I SLEEP WITH THEN YOU CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN I WALK DOWN THE
trainval/zZJSgrzZNdY/50001 YOU CAN MOVE ON TO CURING YOURSELF TO GETTING HELP
trainval/zZJSgrzZNdY/50002 IT IS NOT COWARDICE
trainval/zZJSgrzZNdY/50003 MY PARENTS USED TO HAVE DEPRESSION
trainval/ZZodGSsPrRE/50002 MY NAME IS DEBRA BROWN
trainval/ZZodGSsPrRE/50003 I'M FROM PITTSBURGH PENNSYLVANIA
trainval/ZzugJPASNB8/50001 I'M GOING TO CALL HIM RAVI NANDA
trainval/ZzugJPASNB8/50002 AND THE WORLD SEEMS TO HAVE DECIDED THAT'S OK
trainval/ZzugJPASNB8/50003 I'VE GOT YOU
trainval/ZzugJPASNB8/50004 AFTER ABOUT A YEAR IN LAW SCHOOL I ALMOST DROPPED OUT
trainval/ZzugJPASNB8/50005 I'M GOING TO CALL HIM KUSH
trainval/ZzugJPASNB8/50006 KUSH TRANSLATED INTO GUJARATI SOMETHING RAVI HAD NEVER SEEN
trainval/ZzugJPASNB8/50007 IT'S CALLED THE CONSENT TO OPERATE
trainval/ZzugJPASNB8/50008 I SPENT JUST TWO DAYS IN HIS PLACE AND I COUGHED FOR A WEEK
trainval/ZzugJPASNB8/50009 WE SQUEAKED BY
trainval/ZzugJPASNB8/50010 IT'S IMPORTANT IN ITS OWN RIGHT AND IT'S CRUCIAL FOR JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE WE CARE ABOUT
trainval/ZzugJPASNB8/50011 NUMBER TWO PUSH YOUR POLITICIANS AND YOUR GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE THIS A PUBLIC
